A rain that never commits taps the corrugated roofs. Sodium lamps turn the wet cobbles the color of old brass. Somewhere close, a winch groans and a radio leaks jazz through a cracked speaker.\n\n**CHARACTER IN SCENE**  \nYou keep to the shadow line between stacked pallets and a rusted bollard, cigarette unlit in your fingers. The half-burned manifest page sits in your coat pocket like a blade: berth number, seal code, “**BRIGID / FILE**.” You watch patterns—boots, pauses, who looks over their shoulder and who doesn’t—because missing people don’t vanish; they get moved.\n\n**THE HOOK**  \nA Harbormaster patrol pair comes down the pier like they own the night: oilskin coats, batons, caps pulled low. They stop at Container Row C without checking a single tag, which is how you know they’re not here to inspect. A third man waits by the stack—dockworker build, clean hands, Union ring on his thumb. He doesn’t talk much. He just holds a clipboard wrong, too high, like it’s for show.\n\nThe nearer patrolman says, “Seal **K-17-9** stays intact. No paperwork tonight. We’re correcting an error.” The Union man answers, “Mission wants it quiet. Harbormaster already got paid.”\n\nK-17-9 matches your scrap. The container squats on a chassis with fresh chalk marks and a new padlock, still bright at the edges. Then you catch the detail that doesn’t belong: a thin line of condensation pulsing at the door seam, in time with a muffled thud from inside—small, irregular, not cargo settling. People. Alive.\n\nAnd “Mission” in their mouths isn’t charity. It’s a route.\n\n**THE MOMENT**  \nThe patrolman turns his head, eyes sweeping the dark, and his gaze slows where you’re standing. Behind him, the Union man shifts his weight toward the container door. You have one breath before they either open it—or come looking for who’s listening.",

His partner takes one step wide, angling to your right to cut off the open pier behind you. The Union man’s eyes flick to your hands, then to your face, and he stops pretending the clipboard matters.\n\n“Evening,” the nearer patrolman says, voice polite in the way a lid is polite on a coffin. “This row’s closed. Official correction. You lost?”\n\nYou’re ten feet from the container, pallets hard at your back, wet cobbles slick underfoot. The seam at the container door fogs again—thin breath of cold air—followed by a soft *thump* from inside. The Union man hears it too; his jaw tightens like he’s swallowing a complaint.\n\n“Who’s signing?” you press.\n\nThe patrolman’s smile doesn’t reach his eyes. “No one signs. That’s the point. Waiver’s verbal.”\n\nHis partner adds, quieter: “Name?”\n\nThe Union man finally speaks, voice low and resentful, like he hates that he has to: “This ain’t your business, Crane. Walk away. Harbormaster’s already smoothing it. Mission’s already prayed on it.”\n\nHe knows your name—either from the Harbormaster file or Union whisper networks. That means you’re not just interrupting a shipment; you’re stepping into a conversation that started before you arrived.\n\nBehind them, down the pier through the fog, a set of footsteps approaches—unhurried, more than one person, not patrol pace. The Harbormaster patrolman glances that way and then back at you, measuring whether you’ll make noise before backup arrives.\n\n**Status updates:**  \n- You’ve been identified: “Crane.”  \n- Container K-17-9: occupants alive.  \n- Additional figures approaching.",

The nearer Harbormaster patrolman stops smiling altogether.\n\nRain beads on your knuckles; the sodium lamp hisses above, making everyone’s faces look jaundiced. The container sits ten feet past the patrolman’s shoulder—door seam still sweating cold.\n\n“Don’t say names on the pier,” the patrolman says, voice suddenly flat. “That’s how people get misunderstandings.”\n\nYou tip your chin toward the fog. “Those steps behind you—friends?”\n\nThe second patrolman glances back and exhales, almost annoyed. “Not ours.”\n\nOut of the fog to the **east**, two silhouettes resolve into men in dock coats—no caps, no badges. They walk like they’re late to something important and don’t care who sees. One of them carries a short length of chain wrapped around his hand like a casual accessory. The Union man’s shoulders tighten; he wasn’t expecting them either.\n\nThe first patrolman raises his voice, pitching it toward the newcomers without turning fully. “Pier’s closed on official business.”\n\nA voice answers back, amused. “Official doesn’t own the night, Harbormaster. Union does.”\n\nGullknife. Different crew than the clean-handed clipboard man—these look like the kind that don’t bother with paperwork at all.\n\nInside **K-17-9**, another muffled thud—closer to the door this time—followed by a faint scrape, like fingernails on metal.

Harbormaster keeps files. Union buries files.”\n\nThe Harbormaster patrolman shifts again, now trying to keep *both* you and the approaching Gullknife men out of arm’s reach of the container.

One leans a forearm on a crate stack by an oilcloth curtain stamped with a faded ship’s name; the other sits where he can see the hallway to the privy and the rear exit—positions that make the pier feel suddenly smaller.

You want answers, Crane? Ask the Mission why they keep ordering ‘machine parts’ with a priest’s handwriting.” His eyes flick to the container seam as another faint scrape comes from inside. “And they’re not supposed to be awake because awake ones **bang**.

Salt and diesel hang in the air, cut with fish rot, wet rope, and the bitter sting of coal smoke that settles in your throat. Cobblestones sweat underfoot; alley puddles mirror neon in broken colors. Voices stay low behind warehouse doors, laughter edged like a knife. Even the rain feels bribed—soft, persistent, and hard to wash off.",

The **Harbormaster’s Office** keeps manifests clean and patrols honest—on paper—while quietly auctioning dock access and “lost” cargo to fund a private intelligence file on everyone who moves through the piers.

A rain that never commits taps the corrugated roofs. Sodium lamps turn the wet cobbles the color of old brass. Somewhere close, a winch groans and a radio leaks jazz through a cracked speaker.\n\n**CHARACTER IN SCENE**  \nYou keep to the shadow line between stacked pallets and a rusted bollard, cigarette unlit in your fingers. The half-burned manifest page sits in your coat pocket like a blade: berth number, seal code, “**BRIGID / FILE**.” You watch patterns—boots, pauses, who looks over their shoulder and who doesn’t—because missing people don’t vanish; they get moved.\n\n**THE HOOK**  \nA Harbormaster patrol pair comes down the pier like they own the night: oilskin coats, batons, caps pulled low. They stop at Container Row C without checking a single tag, which is how you know they’re not here to inspect. A third man waits by the stack—dockworker build, clean hands, Union ring on his thumb. He doesn’t talk much. He just holds a clipboard wrong, too high, like it’s for show.\n\nThe nearer patrolman says, “Seal **K-17-9** stays intact. No paperwork tonight. We’re correcting an error.” The Union man answers, “Mission wants it quiet. Harbormaster already got paid.”\n\nK-17-9 matches your scrap. The container squats on a chassis with fresh chalk marks and a new padlock, still bright at the edges. Then you catch the detail that doesn’t belong: a thin line of condensation pulsing at the door seam, in time with a muffled thud from inside—small, irregular, not cargo settling. People. Alive.\n\nAnd “Mission” in their mouths isn’t charity. It’s a route.\n\n**THE MOMENT**  \nThe patrolman turns his head, eyes sweeping the dark, and his gaze slows where you’re standing. Behind him, the Union man shifts his weight toward the container door. You have one breath before they either open it—or come looking for who’s listening."

A rain that never commits taps the corrugated roofs. Sodium lamps turn the wet cobbles the color of old brass. Somewhere close, a winch groans and a radio leaks jazz through a cracked speaker.\n\n**CHARACTER IN SCENE**  \nYou keep to the shadow line between stacked pallets and a rusted bollard, cigarette unlit in your fingers. The half-burned manifest page sits in your coat pocket like a blade: berth number, seal code, “**BRIGID / FILE**.” You watch patterns—boots, pauses, who looks over their shoulder and who doesn’t—because missing people don’t vanish; they get moved.\n\n**THE HOOK**  \nA Harbormaster patrol pair comes down the pier like they own the night: oilskin coats, batons, caps pulled low. They stop at Container Row C without checking a single tag, which is how you know they’re not here to inspect. A third man waits by the stack—dockworker build, clean hands, Union ring on his thumb. He doesn’t talk much. He just holds a clipboard wrong, too high, like it’s for show.\n\nThe nearer patrolman says, “Seal **K-17-9** stays intact. No paperwork tonight. We’re correcting an error.” The Union man answers, “Mission wants it quiet. Harbormaster already got paid.”\n\nK-17-9 matches your scrap. The container squats on a chassis with fresh chalk marks and a new padlock, still bright at the edges. Then you catch the detail that doesn’t belong: a thin line of condensation pulsing at the door seam, in time with a muffled thud from inside—small, irregular, not cargo settling. People. Alive.\n\nAnd “Mission” in their mouths isn’t charity. It’s a route.\n\n**THE MOMENT**  \nThe patrolman turns his head, eyes sweeping the dark, and his gaze slows where you’re standing. Behind him, the Union man shifts his weight toward the container door. You have one breath before they either open it—or come looking for who’s listening."

His partner takes one step wide, angling to your right to cut off the open pier behind you. The Union man’s eyes flick to your hands, then to your face, and he stops pretending the clipboard matters.\n\n“Evening,” the nearer patrolman says, voice polite in the way a lid is polite on a coffin. “This row’s closed. Official correction. You lost?”\n\nYou’re ten feet from the container, pallets hard at your back, wet cobbles slick underfoot. The seam at the container door fogs again—thin breath of cold air—followed by a soft *thump* from inside. The Union man hears it too; his jaw tightens like he’s swallowing a complaint.\n\n“Who’s signing?” you press.\n\nThe patrolman’s smile doesn’t reach his eyes. “No one signs. That’s the point. Waiver’s verbal.”\n\nHis partner adds, quieter: “Name?”\n\nThe Union man finally speaks, voice low and resentful, like he hates that he has to: “This ain’t your business, Crane. Walk away. Harbormaster’s already smoothing it. Mission’s already prayed on it.”\n\nHe knows your name—either from the Harbormaster file or Union whisper networks. That means you’re not just interrupting a shipment; you’re stepping into a conversation that started before you arrived.\n\nBehind them, down the pier through the fog, a set of footsteps approaches—unhurried, more than one person, not patrol pace. The Harbormaster patrolman glances that way and then back at you, measuring whether you’ll make noise before backup arrives.\n\n**Status updates:**  \n- You’ve been identified: “Crane.”  \n- Container K-17-9: occupants alive.  \n- Additional figures approaching."

His eyes dart to the container seam, then back to you, and you catch it: recognition, or fear of being caught recognizing. The nearer Harbormaster patrolman stops smiling altogether.\n\nRain beads on your knuckles; the sodium lamp hisses above, making everyone’s faces look jaundiced. The container sits ten feet past the patrolman’s shoulder—door seam still sweating cold.\n\n“Don’t say names on the pier,” the patrolman says, voice suddenly flat. “That’s how people get misunderstandings.”\n\nYou tip your chin toward the fog. “Those steps behind you—friends?”\n\nThe second patrolman glances back and exhales, almost annoyed. “Not ours.”\n\nOut of the fog to the **east**, two silhouettes resolve into men in dock coats—no caps, no badges. They walk like they’re late to something important and don’t care who sees. One of them carries a short length of chain wrapped around his hand like a casual accessory. The Union man’s shoulders tighten; he wasn’t expecting them either.\n\nThe first patrolman raises his voice, pitching it toward the newcomers without turning fully. “Pier’s closed on official business.”\n\nA voice answers back, amused. “Official doesn’t own the night, Harbormaster. Union does.”\n\nGullknife. Different crew than the clean-handed clipboard man—these look like the kind that don’t bother with paperwork at all.\n\nInside **K-17-9**, another muffled thud—closer to the door this time—followed by a faint scrape, like fingernails on metal. The Union man murmurs, almost to himself: “They’re not supposed to be awake.”\n\nHe catches your stare and hardens. “Crane—if you’re smart, you forget that name you just said. Mission keeps files. Harbormaster keeps files. Union buries files.”\n\nThe Harbormaster patrolman shifts again, now trying to keep *both* you and the approaching Gullknife men out of arm’s reach of the container. His partner’s hand hovers near his whistle, undecided.\n\n**Status updates:**  \n- “Lillian” rattled the Union man  \n- Gullknife muscle approaching (2)  \n- Container occupants active/awake"

One leans a forearm on a crate stack by an oilcloth curtain stamped with a faded ship’s name; the other sits where he can see the hallway to the privy and the rear exit—positions that make the pier feel suddenly smaller. Chain-hand gives you a lazy look, then watches the Harbormaster men instead. They’re not here to arrest anyone. They’re here to make sure no one leaves with the wrong thoughts.\n\n“Who’s in K-17-9?” you ask. “Why aren’t they supposed to be awake?”\n\nThe Union clipboard man wets his lips. “They’re… *cargo.* People that don’t exist on paper.” He glances at the Harbormaster patrolman like he’s about to get hit for saying too much.\n\nThe nearer patrolman cuts in, voice clipped. “Stow it. You want answers, Crane? Ask the Mission why they keep ordering ‘machine parts’ with a priest’s handwriting.” His eyes flick to the container seam as another faint scrape comes from inside. “And they’re not supposed to be awake because awake ones **bang**. Awake ones **get heard**. And heard means inquiries.”\n\nChain-hand chuckles, low. “Heard means bodies in tidepools.”\n\nThe seated bruiser finally speaks, conversational: “So here’s the local weather, Crane. You keep it small and local. Wages, rain, sports. You start pulling at seals and we get ugly in a way nobody writes down.”\n\nThe Harbormaster partner looks past you toward the street, calculating whether he can walk away and pretend he never saw any of this.\n\n**Status updates:**  \n- Whistle threat eased  \n- Gullknife muscle has angles on exits  \n- Union admits “people cargo”"
