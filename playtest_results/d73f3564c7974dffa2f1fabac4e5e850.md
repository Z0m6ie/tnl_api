### Turn 4 [PLAYER]

Silas Mercer grew up in a dockside tenement, learning early that secrets weigh more than cargo. Now he works as a private investigator who specializes in quiet surveillance and slow, methodical deductions. Careful, observant, and patient to a fault, he studies a room like a crime scene before he ever asks a question. He’s driven to find the person who framed his late partner, even if it means wading back into the city’s filth one clue at a time.

*Agent reasoning: Generated cautious-style character for Noir Mystery*

### Turn 5 [GAME]

Here's your character:

**Silas Mercer**
*Private Investigator specializing in surveillance and methodical casework*

Silas Mercer was raised in a dockside tenement where bribes, smuggling, and whispered favors were as common as fog off the harbor. He learned to watch first and speak last, taking odd jobs on the piers until a stint as a police clerk taught him how cases get buried and evidence gets "misfiled." After his investigative partner was framed and died before clearing his name, Silas went independent, carrying a battered notebook and a grudge through the city’s rain-soaked back alleys.

**Traits:** Careful, Observant, Patient to a fault, Quietly relentless, Suspicious of authority
**Goal:** Identify who framed his late partner and assemble proof strong enough to expose them, even if it means infiltrating the same corrupt networks that turned the city against them.

### Turn 9 [GAME]

Silas shoved the torn page into his coat and caught the boy’s wrist before he could bolt. A heavy boot hit the café door and the glass rattled in its frame.

Rain hammered the windowpanes and turned Dock Street into a black mirror. This was a back-booth joint off the harbor, all wet wool and burnt coffee, and Silas Mercer was a private investigator who made his living watching people until they slipped.

The boy wore Saint Brigid Mission gray, the kind they handed out with soup and sermons. Saint Brigid was a charity on paper, and a church that kept secrets for leverage in practice. The kid’s eyes kept flicking to the kitchen door like he expected hands to come through it.

Silas didn’t read the whole page. He didn’t need to. His method was simple and it kept him alive. He clocked the ink bleed, the date line, the cramped numbers. He found the name he hadn’t seen in print since the funeral. His partner’s name sat above a dockside timestamp and a note like an order. Transfer to Pier Nine. File under Integrity.

The Civic Integrity Bureau called itself an anti-corruption office, and it buried cases for profit. Pier Nine sat under a midnight “safety stoppage” run by the Harbormaster’s Union, dock bosses who taxed every crate that moved. The page didn’t just point to the docks. It pointed to who had filed the knife.

A familiar face stepped in from the rain. It was Lieutenant Harker from the Bureau, coat too clean for this street, badge tucked like a threat. He saw Silas’s hand at his pocket and smiled like he already owned the evidence.

### Turn 10 [PLAYER]

I loosen my grip on the boy’s wrist but keep him close, eyes flicking to the kitchen door and the café’s back exit. “Lieutenant Harker,” I say evenly. “Didn’t know the Bureau drank this far down the dock—what’s got you out in the rain?”

*Agent reasoning: Harker’s here for the page; I need to buy time, keep the kid from panicking, and avoid a public tussle that gets me searched. I’ll play dumb, read the room, and look for exits/help.*

### Turn 11 [GAME]

Harker lets the door swing shut behind him with his heel, shutting out the street-noise like a lid on a coffin. Your even tone lands; it buys you half a breath of normalcy.

Immediate outcome: he doesn’t rush you. He also doesn’t answer the question straight. Instead he angles his body so he can see both your hands and the boy, and he lifts two fingers in a lazy, practiced “easy” at the waitress—code for *don’t call anyone, don’t interfere*. She freezes mid-pour, coffee trembling in the pot.

The café’s back exit sits past the counter to the east, a narrow corridor marked “STAFF,” its door swollen with damp. From the kitchen door—south of you—comes a metallic clatter and a low murmur that stops too cleanly, like someone just remembered to be quiet.

Harker’s eyes flick to the boy’s Mission coat, then to your pocket where the ledger page sits like a hot coal. “Mercer,” he says, voice dry as paper. “I drink wherever the city leaks. Tonight it’s leaking off Dock Street.”

He steps closer, not enough to crowd you, just enough to make the booth feel smaller. “There was a… misunderstanding at Pier Nine. People got hurt. Rumors got loose. My office is tasked with keeping rumors from becoming riots.” His mouth twitches. “And keeping certain documents from being misread by amateurs.”

The boy flinches when Harker says “documents,” and you feel his shoulder tense under your loosened grip—ready to bolt, but not sure which door won’t get him killed.

Outside the fogged front window, headlights sweep past slow—one car, then another, crawling the curb like they’re looking for a number on a door. Not patrol speed. Hunting speed.

Harker lowers his voice, conversational, almost kind. “You look tired, Silas. I can put the kid somewhere safe. I can put *you* somewhere safe. All I need is to see what you’ve got—so I can log it properly.” He pauses on the word *properly*, like it’s a joke you’re supposed to share. “You don’t want the Union thinking you’re shopping their business. You don’t want Saint Brigid thinking you stole from their confessional.”

Behind him, the kitchen door handle turns—slow—then stops, as if whoever’s on the other side is waiting for a cue.

**Status updates:** Two cars slow outside; Kitchen presence listening.

### Turn 12 [PLAYER]

I smile without warmth and keep my hands visible on the table. “Log it properly? Funny—last time I trusted Bureau paperwork, it got a good man buried.”

I tilt my head toward the kitchen door. “Before we play clerk, tell your friend back there to take his hand off the handle. I don’t like surprises.” Then, to the boy in a low murmur, “When I say ‘coffee,’ you slip for that STAFF door and don’t look back.”

*Agent reasoning: Harker’s stalling while backup boxes us in; the kitchen’s a second threat vector. I need to keep him talking, confirm who’s in the kitchen, and create a clean exit path—preferably through staff—without showing I’m running.*

### Turn 13 [GAME]

Harker’s smile thins. Your line about Bureau paperwork hits where it’s meant to—under the ribs—because his eyes flick for a heartbeat to the ledger-bulge in your coat and then away, like he doesn’t want to acknowledge it has weight.

**Immediate outcome:** the kitchen door handle eases back to neutral. Not all the way—just enough that the message got through. Harker doesn’t look at the door when it happens, but the muscle in his jaw tightens like he’s pulling a leash.

Rain ticks the window beside your booth, the glass fogged to milk; to the east, the “STAFF” corridor sits dim and narrow past the counter, lit by a single buzzing bulb that makes everything look jaundiced.

Harker keeps his hands visible too now, palms open on the booth-back like he’s mirroring you. “No friends,” he says softly. “Just a kitchen and a nervous cook who doesn’t want dock boys tearing up his place.” It’s a lie polished smooth—too smooth for a cook.

He leans in just enough that only you and the boy get it. “The man you’re talking about—your partner—his name’s been showing up in places it shouldn’t. Pier Nine. Integrity files. Donation routes.” He lets that hang, then adds, “You want to know who buried him? Don’t hand that page to the Union. Don’t hand it to the Mission. And don’t make me take it off you in front of witnesses.”

Outside, one of the slow cars stops. Headlights pin the café front like an interrogation lamp. A door opens—no slam, careful—and you catch the silhouette of a man pausing under the awning, looking in through the fogged glass.

The waitress, still frozen, sets a cup down too hard at a nearby table. The clink is loud in the hush.

Harker’s gaze shifts to the boy, and for the first time his voice loses some of its dryness. “Kid doesn’t walk out that staff door unless you want him found in the harbor by morning. The Union’s sweeping shelters tonight. Saint Brigid’s ‘counselors’ are cleaning their own mess. You keep him close, you’re painting a target on his back—and yours.”

From the storm grate under the window by your booth, a thin ribbon of rainwater suddenly burps up, carrying a wad of damp wax paper that lodges against the curb. Something stiff inside it catches the light—paper, folded tight, edges striped with ink.

**Status updates:** Kitchen handle released. Headlights fixed on café. Wax-paper parcel at curb.
