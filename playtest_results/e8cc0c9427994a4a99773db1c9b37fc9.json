CSB sweep beacons flare in the distance, tightening a net that doesn’t care who’s guilty.\n\nEvery corridor on the tug smells faintly sweet—like the black-site decon foam Mara can’t place. Someone on board is already scrubbing logs. Someone else is listening.

        "content": "Cold starlight leaks through the tug’s warped viewport and stains the corridor blue and rust. Fans tick in the ceiling and the bulkheads pop as the hull shrinks and loosens with every temperature swing. The air tastes of oxidized metal and old coolant, with a faint sweet bite that doesn’t belong in recycled systems.\n\nMara Kade moves down the passage in a slow, measured walk, rifle low, eyes never still. She checks each hatch seam with two fingers, feels the vibration of the deck plates, and watches her boot soles stick for a half-step when the gravity sputters, then peel free with a wet sound.\n\nHer wrist slate chirps once and throws a Guild ping across her visor, encrypted and tagged with the Salvagers’ Guild seal—the “union” that sells safety on paper and coordinates in the dark. The lot number means nothing, but the nav offsets do, because only military suites bury errors that way. A partial audio clip rides in the packet, a voice saying “Mara” like a prayer, then a wet choke and hard silence.\n\nShe turns toward the bridge to confirm the course change. The corridor lights dip and recover, like a blink. The tapping cable she’d been tracking stops mid-rhythm.\n\nNo footfalls answer her own. No engine-thrum shifts with the pilot’s hands. The comm line opens on its own and breathes static between words, like someone holding a mic in their teeth.\n\nMara reaches the bridge hatch and finds it unlatched. The bridge beyond sits empty, chairs still warm, consoles lit, and the tug drifts on a steady burn toward the Kestrel Drift. A new beacon pings on the sensor stack—Colonial Security Bureau sweep code, the kind that “inspects” crews and makes witnesses disappear—and it’s close enough to taste."
