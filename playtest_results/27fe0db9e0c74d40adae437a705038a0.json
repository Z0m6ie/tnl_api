The nearest Brass Lantern patrolman doesn’t stop you; he only shifts his hook-hand lantern a fraction, angling its beam to catch your face and throat like a tailor measuring cloth.\n\nYou drift close to the mispronouncing gaslamp on the east curb. Its glass belly sweats a syrupy condensation, and the metal throat inside it *hums*—but when you tilt your head, the hum stutters and tries your name again: “Lio…ra. Li—*or*—a.” Like it’s practicing.\n\nUnder your breath, you count the barker’s rhyme backwards. The calliope at the docks hiccups on a note, and for a blink the shadows around your boots loosen—threads slipping from a seam—before the rhyme catches again and they tug tight, irritated.\n\nThe patrolman answers without looking at the lamp, eyes fixed on you as if the question is the real mechanism. “Evening, miss. Lamps don’t sing.” His voice is calm, rehearsed. “They *report*. If you’re hearing music, it’s the Carnival bleeding noise through the fog.”\n\nBehind him, two more Guilders fan out: one pretends to check a valve-box at the corner; the other watches the boarded stairwell across the street—the one that rustles like turning pages whenever no one stares at it too long. The stairwell’s boards flex inward as if breathing, then go still when the valve-box man glances up.\n\nThe lamp mispronounces you again, softer—almost affectionate—and its glow brightens a shade, painting a thin line of light along your gloved hand where the torn vellum is hidden. The patrolman’s nostrils flare; he’s smelled ink and old paper before. “You wouldn’t be carrying anything that needs registering, would you?”\n\nDown by the docks, the Carnival barker’s rhyme grows louder, and a passerby’s coat-hem begins to *stitch itself* in tiny, quick bites—thread appearing from shadow like pulled teeth.\n\n**Status updates:**  \n- Brass Lantern attention: focused on you  \n- Lamp-hum: attempting your name  \n- Carnival rhyme: tightening shadows  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"Torn atlas vellum strip (shifting coordinates, mother’s notes)\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Gaslamp curb on Gloamport street (near Inkbone stall)\"],\"npcs_add\":[\"Brass Lantern patrolman (nearest)\",\"Two Brass Lantern guilders (valve-box, watcher)\",\"Carnival barker (docks, distant)\"]}\n```",

        "content": "Night settles over Gloamport, and the fog clings like wet wool. Liora Thimblewick tells herself she feels fine, yet her ribs keep remembering the shape of her mother’s absence.\n\nShe thinks in maps, not grief. She treats every bad omen like a folded note meant for her pocket.\n\nShe stands at an Inkbone stall, where the Inkbone Archivists mend maps and hoard torn pages behind polite smiles. She trades two tarnished buttons for a thimble of ink, then watches lanternlight puddle on the cobbles like melted butter.\n\nA nearby gaslamp hums, and Liora listens the way other people look both ways. She hears a lullaby braided into the hiss, and she marks it in her head as a street that might lead somewhere.\n\nA runner slips from the fog and presses a sealed packet into her palm. The wax holds a soot-smear shaped like a keyhole, and her heart answers it like a dog hearing its own name.\n\nShe breaks the seal with her thumbnail and finds a strip of vellum torn from an atlas. The ink shifts when she looks away, and the coordinates hop like fleas across the paper, because ignored places hate to sit still.\n\nHer mother’s notes crowd the margin in familiar slant. DO NOT TRUST THE HUM. COUNT THE RHYMES BACKWARDS. THE DOOR LEARNS YOUR NAME, crossed out so hard it bruises the page.\n\nEvery street-lamp flares at once, and the Brass Lantern Guild patrol—keepers of gaslights and “safety”—turns the corner in step. From the docks, the Soot-Sweet Carnival Combine’s calliope stutters, and a barker chants a nursery rhyme that makes shadows tug at coat-hems, hunting for thread.\n\nLiora tucks the vellum under her glove, and the nearest lamp mispronounces “Liora” like it tastes her. The boarded stairwell across the street rustles like turning pages, and she has to choose whether to run toward it or smile at the patrol first."

        "content": "Your smile lands cleanly—polite, unthreatening, the sort that says you’re just another citizen appreciating civic lighting. The nearest Brass Lantern patrolman doesn’t stop you; he only shifts his hook-hand lantern a fraction, angling its beam to catch your face and throat like a tailor measuring cloth.\n\nYou drift close to the mispronouncing gaslamp on the east curb. Its glass belly sweats a syrupy condensation, and the metal throat inside it *hums*—but when you tilt your head, the hum stutters and tries your name again: “Lio…ra. Li—*or*—a.” Like it’s practicing.\n\nUnder your breath, you count the barker’s rhyme backwards. The calliope at the docks hiccups on a note, and for a blink the shadows around your boots loosen—threads slipping from a seam—before the rhyme catches again and they tug tight, irritated.\n\nThe patrolman answers without looking at the lamp, eyes fixed on you as if the question is the real mechanism. “Evening, miss. Lamps don’t sing.” His voice is calm, rehearsed. “They *report*. If you’re hearing music, it’s the Carnival bleeding noise through the fog.”\n\nBehind him, two more Guilders fan out: one pretends to check a valve-box at the corner; the other watches the boarded stairwell across the street—the one that rustles like turning pages whenever no one stares at it too long. The stairwell’s boards flex inward as if breathing, then go still when the valve-box man glances up.\n\nThe lamp mispronounces you again, softer—almost affectionate—and its glow brightens a shade, painting a thin line of light along your gloved hand where the torn vellum is hidden. The patrolman’s nostrils flare; he’s smelled ink and old paper before. “You wouldn’t be carrying anything that needs registering, would you?”\n\nDown by the docks, the Carnival barker’s rhyme grows louder, and a passerby’s coat-hem begins to *stitch itself* in tiny, quick bites—thread appearing from shadow like pulled teeth.\n\n**Status updates:**  \n- Brass Lantern attention: focused on you  \n- Lamp-hum: attempting your name  \n- Carnival rhyme: tightening shadows  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"Torn atlas vellum strip (shifting coordinates, mother’s notes)\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Gaslamp curb on Gloamport street (near Inkbone stall)\"],\"npcs_add\":[\"Brass Lantern patrolman (nearest)\",\"Two Brass Lantern guilders (valve-box, watcher)\",\"Carnival barker (docks, distant)\"]}\n```"

Only myself, I’m afraid—and a very law-abiding thimble of Inkbone ink.” I hold up the tiny vial openly while keeping the vellum tucked, then lean closer to the gaslamp and whisper, “If you *report*, darling, who do you report to—Guild, or something older?”  \n\nWithout looking like I’m moving with purpose, I edge a step at a time toward the boarded stairwell, still counting the barker’s rhyme backwards under my breath, and ask the patrolman, “So—hypothetically—if a lamp *mispronounced* someone’s name, would that be… a maintenance issue?”"
