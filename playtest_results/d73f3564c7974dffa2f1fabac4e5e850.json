Instead he angles his body so he can see both your hands and the boy, and he lifts two fingers in a lazy, practiced “easy” at the waitress—code for *don’t call anyone, don’t interfere*. She freezes mid-pour, coffee trembling in the pot.\n\nThe café’s back exit sits past the counter to the east, a narrow corridor marked “STAFF,” its door swollen with damp. From the kitchen door—south of you—comes a metallic clatter and a low murmur that stops too cleanly, like someone just remembered to be quiet.\n\nHarker’s eyes flick to the boy’s Mission coat, then to your pocket where the ledger page sits like a hot coal. “Mercer,” he says, voice dry as paper. “I drink wherever the city leaks. Tonight it’s leaking off Dock Street.”\n\nHe steps closer, not enough to crowd you, just enough to make the booth feel smaller. “There was a… misunderstanding at Pier Nine. People got hurt. Rumors got loose. My office is tasked with keeping rumors from becoming riots.” His mouth twitches. “And keeping certain documents from being misread by amateurs.”\n\nThe boy flinches when Harker says “documents,” and you feel his shoulder tense under your loosened grip—ready to bolt, but not sure which door won’t get him killed.\n\nOutside the fogged front window, headlights sweep past slow—one car, then another, crawling the curb like they’re looking for a number on a door. Not patrol speed. Hunting speed.\n\nHarker lowers his voice, conversational, almost kind. “You look tired, Silas. I can put the kid somewhere safe. I can put *you* somewhere safe. All I need is to see what you’ve got—so I can log it properly.” He pauses on the word *properly*, like it’s a joke you’re supposed to share. “You don’t want the Union thinking you’re shopping their business. You don’t want Saint Brigid thinking you stole from their confessional.”\n\nBehind him, the kitchen door handle turns—slow—then stops, as if whoever’s on the other side is waiting for a cue.\n\n**Status updates:** Two cars slow outside; Kitchen presence listening.",

Not all the way—just enough that the message got through. Harker doesn’t look at the door when it happens, but the muscle in his jaw tightens like he’s pulling a leash.\n\nRain ticks the window beside your booth, the glass fogged to milk; to the east, the “STAFF” corridor sits dim and narrow past the counter, lit by a single buzzing bulb that makes everything look jaundiced.\n\nHarker keeps his hands visible too now, palms open on the booth-back like he’s mirroring you. “No friends,” he says softly. “Just a kitchen and a nervous cook who doesn’t want dock boys tearing up his place.” It’s a lie polished smooth—too smooth for a cook.\n\nHe leans in just enough that only you and the boy get it. “The man you’re talking about—your partner—his name’s been showing up in places it shouldn’t. Pier Nine. Integrity files. Donation routes.” He lets that hang, then adds, “You want to know who buried him? Don’t hand that page to the Union. Don’t hand it to the Mission. And don’t make me take it off you in front of witnesses.”\n\nOutside, one of the slow cars stops. Headlights pin the café front like an interrogation lamp. A door opens—no slam, careful—and you catch the silhouette of a man pausing under the awning, looking in through the fogged glass.\n\nThe waitress, still frozen, sets a cup down too hard at a nearby table. The clink is loud in the hush.\n\nHarker’s gaze shifts to the boy, and for the first time his voice loses some of its dryness. “Kid doesn’t walk out that staff door unless you want him found in the harbor by morning. The Union’s sweeping shelters tonight. Saint Brigid’s ‘counselors’ are cleaning their own mess. You keep him close, you’re painting a target on his back—and yours.”\n\nFrom the storm grate under the window by your booth, a thin ribbon of rainwater suddenly burps up, carrying a wad of damp wax paper that lodges against the curb.

A boy from Saint Brigid’s shelter slides a torn ledger page across the table with two fingers like it’s contaminated. Ink blots, cramped penance-entries—names, dates, amounts. Near the bottom: **your late partner’s name**, paired with a dockside timestamp and a note that doesn’t read like confession so much as instruction: *“Transfer to Pier Nine. File under Integrity.”*\n\nThe boy doesn’t ask for money. He asks for **protection**. He says the Mission’s “counselors” have been taking people into back rooms for “prayer” and sending them out hollow-eyed. He says Union men are dragging sleepers out of the shelter by the collar, demanding to know who’s been copying pages. He says the Civic Integrity Bureau showed up first at the crane collapse—before the sirens—already carrying blank forms, already calling it an “evidence sweep.”\n\nOutside, Pier Nine is locked down under the midnight safety stoppage, but the docks are louder than ever: trucks rerouted, crews idled, tempers sharp, bribes flowing like gutter water. Someone is using the chaos to move something—or erase something.\n\nThe ledger page feels like a door left ajar. It could be bait. It could be the first clean thread you’ve had in years. Either way, someone wants it back badly enough to kill for it—and someone else wants you holding it long enough to be blamed."

When the Mission’s ledger starts circulating, all three quietly hunt the same messenger.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"factions\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Harbormaster’s Union\",\n      \"public_front\": \"Dockworkers’ union maintaining order, safety, and fair wages on the waterfront.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Controls smuggling routes, fixes manifests, and extorts crews and merchants through tribute and sabotage.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Civic Integrity Bureau\",\n      \"public_front\": \"Municipal anti-corruption office auditing police, courts, and public contracts.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Sells protection, buries evidence, and manipulates investigations to steer contracts and elections.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Saint Brigid Mission\",\n      \"public_front\": \"Charity mission providing soup, beds, and medical aid to the poor and dockside drifters.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Launders money through donations and maintains blackmail ledgers from confessions and “counseling.”\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

      "Silas Mercer gets the offer in a place where everyone pretends not to see: the back booth of a rain-stained café off Dock Street, windows fogged to milk. A boy from Saint Brigid’s shelter slides a torn ledger page across the table with two fingers like it’s contaminated. Ink blots, cramped penance-entries—names, dates, amounts. Near the bottom: **your late partner’s name**, paired with a dockside timestamp and a note that doesn’t read like confession so much as instruction: *“Transfer to Pier Nine. File under Integrity.”*\n\nThe boy doesn’t ask for money. He asks for **protection**. He says the Mission’s “counselors” have been taking people into back rooms for “prayer” and sending them out hollow-eyed. He says Union men are dragging sleepers out of the shelter by the collar, demanding to know who’s been copying pages. He says the Civic Integrity Bureau showed up first at the crane collapse—before the sirens—already carrying blank forms, already calling it an “evidence sweep.”\n\nOutside, Pier Nine is locked down under the midnight safety stoppage, but the docks are louder than ever: trucks rerouted, crews idled, tempers sharp, bribes flowing like gutter water. Someone is using the chaos to move something—or erase something.\n\nThe ledger page feels like a door left ajar. It could be bait. It could be the first clean thread you’ve had in years. Either way, someone wants it back badly enough to kill for it—and someone else wants you holding it long enough to be blamed."

A heavy boot hit the café door and the glass rattled in its frame.\n\nRain hammered the windowpanes and turned Dock Street into a black mirror. This was a back-booth joint off the harbor, all wet wool and burnt coffee, and Silas Mercer was a private investigator who made his living watching people until they slipped.\n\nThe boy wore Saint Brigid Mission gray, the kind they handed out with soup and sermons. Saint Brigid was a charity on paper, and a church that kept secrets for leverage in practice. The kid’s eyes kept flicking to the kitchen door like he expected hands to come through it.\n\nSilas didn’t read the whole page. He didn’t need to. His method was simple and it kept him alive. He clocked the ink bleed, the date line, the cramped numbers. He found the name he hadn’t seen in print since the funeral. His partner’s name sat above a dockside timestamp and a note like an order. Transfer to Pier Nine. File under Integrity.\n\nThe Civic Integrity Bureau called itself an anti-corruption office, and it buried cases for profit. Pier Nine sat under a midnight “safety stoppage” run by the Harbormaster’s Union, dock bosses who taxed every crate that moved. The page didn’t just point to the docks. It pointed to who had filed the knife.\n\nA familiar face stepped in from the rain. It was Lieutenant Harker from the Bureau, coat too clean for this street, badge tucked like a threat. He saw Silas’s hand at his pocket and smiled like he already owned the evidence."

Your even tone lands; it buys you half a breath of normalcy.\n\nImmediate outcome: he doesn’t rush you. He also doesn’t answer the question straight. Instead he angles his body so he can see both your hands and the boy, and he lifts two fingers in a lazy, practiced “easy” at the waitress—code for *don’t call anyone, don’t interfere*. She freezes mid-pour, coffee trembling in the pot.\n\nThe café’s back exit sits past the counter to the east, a narrow corridor marked “STAFF,” its door swollen with damp. From the kitchen door—south of you—comes a metallic clatter and a low murmur that stops too cleanly, like someone just remembered to be quiet.\n\nHarker’s eyes flick to the boy’s Mission coat, then to your pocket where the ledger page sits like a hot coal. “Mercer,” he says, voice dry as paper. “I drink wherever the city leaks. Tonight it’s leaking off Dock Street.”\n\nHe steps closer, not enough to crowd you, just enough to make the booth feel smaller. “There was a… misunderstanding at Pier Nine. People got hurt. Rumors got loose. My office is tasked with keeping rumors from becoming riots.” His mouth twitches. “And keeping certain documents from being misread by amateurs.”\n\nThe boy flinches when Harker says “documents,” and you feel his shoulder tense under your loosened grip—ready to bolt, but not sure which door won’t get him killed.\n\nOutside the fogged front window, headlights sweep past slow—one car, then another, crawling the curb like they’re looking for a number on a door. Not patrol speed. Hunting speed.\n\nHarker lowers his voice, conversational, almost kind. “You look tired, Silas. I can put the kid somewhere safe. I can put *you* somewhere safe. All I need is to see what you’ve got—so I can log it properly.” He pauses on the word *properly*, like it’s a joke you’re supposed to share. “You don’t want the Union thinking you’re shopping their business. You don’t want Saint Brigid thinking you stole from their confessional.”\n\nBehind him, the kitchen door handle turns—slow—then stops, as if whoever’s on the other side is waiting for a cue.\n\n**Status updates:** Two cars slow outside; Kitchen presence listening."

I don’t like surprises.” Then, to the boy in a low murmur, “When I say ‘coffee,’ you slip for that STAFF door and don’t look back.”"

Your line about Bureau paperwork hits where it’s meant to—under the ribs—because his eyes flick for a heartbeat to the ledger-bulge in your coat and then away, like he doesn’t want to acknowledge it has weight.\n\n**Immediate outcome:** the kitchen door handle eases back to neutral. Not all the way—just enough that the message got through. Harker doesn’t look at the door when it happens, but the muscle in his jaw tightens like he’s pulling a leash.\n\nRain ticks the window beside your booth, the glass fogged to milk; to the east, the “STAFF” corridor sits dim and narrow past the counter, lit by a single buzzing bulb that makes everything look jaundiced.\n\nHarker keeps his hands visible too now, palms open on the booth-back like he’s mirroring you. “No friends,” he says softly. “Just a kitchen and a nervous cook who doesn’t want dock boys tearing up his place.” It’s a lie polished smooth—too smooth for a cook.\n\nHe leans in just enough that only you and the boy get it. “The man you’re talking about—your partner—his name’s been showing up in places it shouldn’t. Pier Nine. Integrity files. Donation routes.” He lets that hang, then adds, “You want to know who buried him? Don’t hand that page to the Union. Don’t hand it to the Mission. And don’t make me take it off you in front of witnesses.”\n\nOutside, one of the slow cars stops. Headlights pin the café front like an interrogation lamp. A door opens—no slam, careful—and you catch the silhouette of a man pausing under the awning, looking in through the fogged glass.\n\nThe waitress, still frozen, sets a cup down too hard at a nearby table. The clink is loud in the hush.\n\nHarker’s gaze shifts to the boy, and for the first time his voice loses some of its dryness. “Kid doesn’t walk out that staff door unless you want him found in the harbor by morning. The Union’s sweeping shelters tonight. Saint Brigid’s ‘counselors’ are cleaning their own mess. You keep him close, you’re painting a target on his back—and yours.”\n\nFrom the storm grate under the window by your booth, a thin ribbon of rainwater suddenly burps up, carrying a wad of damp wax paper that lodges against the curb. Something stiff inside it catches the light—paper, folded tight, edges striped with ink.\n\n**Status updates:** Kitchen handle released. Headlights fixed on café. Wax-paper parcel at curb."
