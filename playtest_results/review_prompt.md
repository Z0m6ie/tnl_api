## Your Task

Analyze these playthroughs and identify issues and improvements in the following categories:

### 1. Narrative Issues
- Contradictions in the story (events, facts, or details that conflict)
- NPCs acting out of character or inconsistently
- Plot holes or loose threads that were never resolved
- Inconsistent world details (locations, rules, history)
- Tone breaks (e.g., comedy in horror, jarring mood shifts)
- Pacing problems (too fast, too slow, anticlimactic)

### 2. Recall Problems
- AI forgetting previous events that were clearly established
- Characters forgetting what was said earlier in conversation
- Inventory items appearing/disappearing incorrectly
- Location confusion (describing wrong place, inconsistent geography)
- NPC names or details changing without explanation

### 3. Simulation Issues
- Hidden elements (watchers, guards, traps) revealing too easily or never triggering
- Consequences not matching the severity of actions
- Timed events progressing incorrectly or not at all
- Scene transitions being awkward or illogical
- Triggers firing at inappropriate times

#### Turn 4 **[PLAYER]**

Mara Kade is a disgraced colonial marine who survived a black-site evacuation that everyone in command insists never happened. Now she works as a contracted security escort on deep-space salvage runs, always armed and always expecting betrayal. Hard-edged, hypervigilant, and brutally pragmatic, she keeps people alive by assuming the worst and acting first. She’s determined to find the missing crew from that erased operation—and make someone in power pay for leaving them to die.

*Agent reasoning: Generated aggressive-style character for Sci-Fi Horror Survival*

#### Turn 5 **[GAME]**

Here's your character:

**Mara Kade**
*Contracted security escort for deep-space salvage operations (ex-colonial marine)*

Once a decorated colonial marine, Mara became a pariah after the evacuation of a classified black-site facility—an operation her former command now denies ever occurred.

She survives by taking security contracts on deep-space salvage runs, keeping her head down while quietly hunting for the truth behind the erased mission and the crew who never came home.

**Traits:** Hard-edged and disciplined, Hypervigilant and suspicious, Brutally pragmatic under pressure, Protective of civilians and crewmates, Vengeful toward corrupt authority
**Goal:** Track down the missing crew from the erased black-site operation, uncover who ordered the abandonment, and force someone powerful to answer for it—alive if possible, dead if necessary.

#### Turn 9 **[GAME]**

Cold starlight leaks through the tug’s warped viewport and stains the corridor blue and rust. Fans tick in the ceiling and the bulkheads pop as the hull shrinks and loosens with every temperature swing. The air tastes of oxidized metal and old coolant, with a faint sweet bite that doesn’t belong in recycled systems.

Mara Kade moves down the passage in a slow, measured walk, rifle low, eyes never still. She checks each hatch seam with two fingers, feels the vibration of the deck plates, and watches her boot soles stick for a half-step when the gravity sputters, then peel free with a wet sound.

Her wrist slate chirps once and throws a Guild ping across her visor, encrypted and tagged with the Salvagers’ Guild seal—the “union” that sells safety on paper and coordinates in the dark. The lot number means nothing, but the nav offsets do, because only military suites bury errors that way. A partial audio clip rides in the packet, a voice saying “Mara” like a prayer, then a wet choke and hard silence.

She turns toward the bridge to confirm the course change. The corridor lights dip and recover, like a blink. The tapping cable she’d been tracking stops mid-rhythm.

No footfalls answer her own. No engine-thrum shifts with the pilot’s hands. The comm line opens on its own and breathes static between words, like someone holding a mic in their teeth.

Mara reaches the bridge hatch and finds it unlatched. The bridge beyond sits empty, chairs still warm, consoles lit, and the tug drifts on a steady burn toward the Kestrel Drift. A new beacon pings on the sensor stack—Colonial Security Bureau sweep code, the kind that “inspects” crews and makes witnesses disappear—and it’s close enough to taste.

#### Turn 10 **[PLAYER]**

I slam the bridge hatch shut and dog it, then trigger a shipwide lockdown from the nearest console—seal interior doors, kill nonessential comms, and switch cameras to my visor feed. “Crew, sound off now or I start shooting locks,” I bark into the intercom while yanking nav and comm logs for the last ten minutes and pinging sensors for life signs and boarders.

*Agent reasoning: Bridge is empty but chairs are warm—crew didn’t leave willingly. CSB sweep inbound means we’re about to get erased. I need answers fast: lock ship down, pull logs, arm up, and find the crew before whatever’s on board does.*

#### Turn 11 **[GAME]**



#### Turn 12 **[PLAYER]**

I re-dog the bridge hatch and slam my palm on the lockdown controls: seal internal doors, route all cams to my visor, and cut external comms to receive-only. “Sound off, now—names and locations—or I start cutting doors,” I snarl over intercom while I rip the last ten minutes of nav/comm logs and run a quick sweep for life signs and unauthorized transponders.

*Agent reasoning: Bridge was open and the crew vanished—either boarders or something inside. I need control of the ship, eyes everywhere, and bodies accounted for fast before CSB gets in range.*

#### Turn 13 **[GAME]**

#### Turn 4 **[PLAYER]**

Liora Thimblewick was raised in the soot-sweet alleys of Gloamport, where lanterns whisper secrets and shadows barter in nursery rhymes. A traveling curiosities-cartographer, she maps impossible places that appear only when no one is looking. Inquisitive, bright-eyed, and stubbornly cheerful in the face of dread, she treats every omen like an invitation. She’s determined to find the missing page of her mother’s atlas—said to reveal the door where the world’s lost wonders go to hide.

#### Turn 9 **[GAME]**

Night settles over Gloamport, and the fog clings like wet wool. Liora Thimblewick tells herself she feels fine, yet her ribs keep remembering the shape of her mother’s absence.

She thinks in maps, not grief. She treats every bad omen like a folded note meant for her pocket.

She stands at an Inkbone stall, where the Inkbone Archivists mend maps and hoard torn pages behind polite smiles. She trades two tarnished buttons for a thimble of ink, then watches lanternlight puddle on the cobbles like melted butter.

A nearby gaslamp hums, and Liora listens the way other people look both ways. She hears a lullaby braided into the hiss, and she marks it in her head as a street that might lead somewhere.

A runner slips from the fog and presses a sealed packet into her palm. The wax holds a soot-smear shaped like a keyhole, and her heart answers it like a dog hearing its own name.

She breaks the seal with her thumbnail and finds a strip of vellum torn from an atlas. The ink shifts when she looks away, and the coordinates hop like fleas across the paper, because ignored places hate to sit still.

Her mother’s notes crowd the margin in familiar slant. DO NOT TRUST THE HUM. COUNT THE RHYMES BACKWARDS. THE DOOR LEARNS YOUR NAME, crossed out so hard it bruises the page.

Every street-lamp flares at once, and the Brass Lantern Guild patrol—keepers of gaslights and “safety”—turns the corner in step. From the docks, the Soot-Sweet Carnival Combine’s calliope stutters, and a barker chants a nursery rhyme that makes shadows tug at coat-hems, hunting for thread.

Liora tucks the vellum under her glove, and the nearest lamp mispronounces “Liora” like it tastes her. The boarded stairwell across the street rustles like turning pages, and she has to choose whether to run toward it or smile at the patrol first.

#### Turn 10 **[PLAYER]**

I flash the Brass Lantern patrol my most innocent smile and drift toward the mispronouncing gaslamp, head tilted like I’m admiring the craftsmanship. Under my breath I start counting the barker’s nursery rhyme backwards, and I ask the nearest patrolman, “Evening—has this lamp always… *sung* like that?”

*Agent reasoning: The patrol will notice me if I bolt; I want to gather info and test the “hum” warning while keeping the vellum hidden.*

#### Turn 11 **[GAME]**

Your smile lands cleanly—polite, unthreatening, the sort that says you’re just another citizen appreciating civic lighting. The nearest Brass Lantern patrolman doesn’t stop you; he only shifts his hook-hand lantern a fraction, angling its beam to catch your face and throat like a tailor measuring cloth.

You drift close to the mispronouncing gaslamp on the east curb. Its glass belly sweats a syrupy condensation, and the metal throat inside it *hums*—but when you tilt your head, the hum stutters and tries your name again: “Lio…ra. Li—*or*—a.” Like it’s practicing.

Under your breath, you count the barker’s rhyme backwards. The calliope at the docks hiccups on a note, and for a blink the shadows around your boots loosen—threads slipping from a seam—before the rhyme catches again and they tug tight, irritated.

The patrolman answers without looking at the lamp, eyes fixed on you as if the question is the real mechanism. “Evening, miss. Lamps don’t sing.” His voice is calm, rehearsed. “They *report*. If you’re hearing music, it’s the Carnival bleeding noise through the fog.”

Behind him, two more Guilders fan out: one pretends to check a valve-box at the corner; the other watches the boarded stairwell across the street—the one that rustles like turning pages whenever no one stares at it too long. The stairwell’s boards flex inward as if breathing, then go still when the valve-box man glances up.

The lamp mispronounces you again, softer—almost affectionate—and its glow brightens a shade, painting a thin line of light along your gloved hand where the torn vellum is hidden. The patrolman’s nostrils flare; he’s smelled ink and old paper before. “You wouldn’t be carrying anything that needs registering, would you?”

Down by the docks, the Carnival barker’s rhyme grows louder, and a passerby’s coat-hem begins to *stitch itself* in tiny, quick bites—thread appearing from shadow like pulled teeth.

**Status updates:**  
- Brass Lantern attention: focused on you  
- Lamp-hum: attempting your name  
- Carnival rhyme: tightening shadows

```

#### Turn 12 **[PLAYER]**

I pat my pockets with a little laugh. “Registering? Only myself, I’m afraid—and a very law-abiding thimble of Inkbone ink.” I hold up the tiny vial openly while keeping the vellum tucked, then lean closer to the gaslamp and whisper, “If you *report*, darling, who do you report to—Guild, or something older?”  

Without looking like I’m moving with purpose, I edge a step at a time toward the boarded stairwell, still counting the barker’s rhyme backwards under my breath, and ask the patrolman, “So—hypothetically—if a lamp *mispronounced* someone’s name, would that be… a maintenance issue?”

*Agent reasoning: The patrol is sniffing around for the vellum; I need to misdirect them while learning what the lamp “reports” and keeping the rhyme backward to loosen the shadows. I’ll offer something harmless to register and ask pointed questions, buying time to slip toward the breathing stairwell.*

Silas Mercer grew up in a dockside tenement, learning early that secrets weigh more than cargo. Now he works as a private investigator who specializes in quiet surveillance and slow, methodical deductions. Careful, observant, and patient to a fault, he studies a room like a crime scene before he ever asks a question. He’s driven to find the person who framed his late partner, even if it means wading back into the city’s filth one clue at a time.

Silas shoved the torn page into his coat and caught the boy’s wrist before he could bolt. A heavy boot hit the café door and the glass rattled in its frame.

Rain hammered the windowpanes and turned Dock Street into a black mirror. This was a back-booth joint off the harbor, all wet wool and burnt coffee, and Silas Mercer was a private investigator who made his living watching people until they slipped.

The boy wore Saint Brigid Mission gray, the kind they handed out with soup and sermons. Saint Brigid was a charity on paper, and a church that kept secrets for leverage in practice. The kid’s eyes kept flicking to the kitchen door like he expected hands to come through it.

Silas didn’t read the whole page. He didn’t need to. His method was simple and it kept him alive. He clocked the ink bleed, the date line, the cramped numbers. He found the name he hadn’t seen in print since the funeral. His partner’s name sat above a dockside timestamp and a note like an order. Transfer to Pier Nine. File under Integrity.

The Civic Integrity Bureau called itself an anti-corruption office, and it buried cases for profit. Pier Nine sat under a midnight “safety stoppage” run by the Harbormaster’s Union, dock bosses who taxed every crate that moved. The page didn’t just point to the docks. It pointed to who had filed the knife.

A familiar face stepped in from the rain. It was Lieutenant Harker from the Bureau, coat too clean for this street, badge tucked like a threat. He saw Silas’s hand at his pocket and smiled like he already owned the evidence.

#### Turn 10 **[PLAYER]**

I loosen my grip on the boy’s wrist but keep him close, eyes flicking to the kitchen door and the café’s back exit. “Lieutenant Harker,” I say evenly. “Didn’t know the Bureau drank this far down the dock—what’s got you out in the rain?”

*Agent reasoning: Harker’s here for the page; I need to buy time, keep the kid from panicking, and avoid a public tussle that gets me searched. I’ll play dumb, read the room, and look for exits/help.*

#### Turn 11 **[GAME]**

Harker lets the door swing shut behind him with his heel, shutting out the street-noise like a lid on a coffin. Your even tone lands; it buys you half a breath of normalcy.

Immediate outcome: he doesn’t rush you. He also doesn’t answer the question straight. Instead he angles his body so he can see both your hands and the boy, and he lifts two fingers in a lazy, practiced “easy” at the waitress—code for *don’t call anyone, don’t interfere*. She freezes mid-pour, coffee trembling in the pot.

The café’s back exit sits past the counter to the east, a narrow corridor marked “STAFF,” its door swollen with damp. From the kitchen door—south of you—comes a metallic clatter and a low murmur that stops too cleanly, like someone just remembered to be quiet.

Harker’s eyes flick to the boy’s Mission coat, then to your pocket where the ledger page sits like a hot coal. “Mercer,” he says, voice dry as paper. “I drink wherever the city leaks. Tonight it’s leaking off Dock Street.”

He steps closer, not enough to crowd you, just enough to make the booth feel smaller. “There was a… misunderstanding at Pier Nine. People got hurt. Rumors got loose. My office is tasked with keeping rumors from becoming riots.” His mouth twitches. “And keeping certain documents from being misread by amateurs.”

The boy flinches when Harker says “documents,” and you feel his shoulder tense under your loosened grip—ready to bolt, but not sure which door won’t get him killed.

Outside the fogged front window, headlights sweep past slow—one car, then another, crawling the curb like they’re looking for a number on a door. Not patrol speed. Hunting speed.

Harker lowers his voice, conversational, almost kind. “You look tired, Silas. I can put the kid somewhere safe. I can put *you* somewhere safe. All I need is to see what you’ve got—so I can log it properly.” He pauses on the word *properly*, like it’s a joke you’re supposed to share. “You don’t want the Union thinking you’re shopping their business. You don’t want Saint Brigid thinking you stole from their confessional.”

Behind him, the kitchen door handle turns—slow—then stops, as if whoever’s on the other side is waiting for a cue.

**Status updates:** Two cars slow outside; Kitchen presence listening.

#### Turn 12 **[PLAYER]**

I smile without warmth and keep my hands visible on the table. “Log it properly? Funny—last time I trusted Bureau paperwork, it got a good man buried.”

I tilt my head toward the kitchen door. “Before we play clerk, tell your friend back there to take his hand off the handle. I don’t like surprises.” Then, to the boy in a low murmur, “When I say ‘coffee,’ you slip for that STAFF door and don’t look back.”

*Agent reasoning: Harker’s stalling while backup boxes us in; the kitchen’s a second threat vector. I need to keep him talking, confirm who’s in the kitchen, and create a clean exit path—preferably through staff—without showing I’m running.*

#### Turn 13 **[GAME]**

Harker’s smile thins. Your line about Bureau paperwork hits where it’s meant to—under the ribs—because his eyes flick for a heartbeat to the ledger-bulge in your coat and then away, like he doesn’t want to acknowledge it has weight.

**Immediate outcome:** the kitchen door handle eases back to neutral. Not all the way—just enough that the message got through. Harker doesn’t look at the door when it happens, but the muscle in his jaw tightens like he’s pulling a leash.

Rain ticks the window beside your booth, the glass fogged to milk; to the east, the “STAFF” corridor sits dim and narrow past the counter, lit by a single buzzing bulb that makes everything look jaundiced.

Harker keeps his hands visible too now, palms open on the booth-back like he’s mirroring you. “No friends,” he says softly. “Just a kitchen and a nervous cook who doesn’t want dock boys tearing up his place.” It’s a lie polished smooth—too smooth for a cook.

He leans in just enough that only you and the boy get it. “The man you’re talking about—your partner—his name’s been showing up in places it shouldn’t. Pier Nine. Integrity files. Donation routes.” He lets that hang, then adds, “You want to know who buried him? Don’t hand that page to the Union. Don’t hand it to the Mission. And don’t make me take it off you in front of witnesses.”

Outside, one of the slow cars stops. Headlights pin the café front like an interrogation lamp. A door opens—no slam, careful—and you catch the silhouette of a man pausing under the awning, looking in through the fogged glass.

The waitress, still frozen, sets a cup down too hard at a nearby table. The clink is loud in the hush.

Harker’s gaze shifts to the boy, and for the first time his voice loses some of its dryness. “Kid doesn’t walk out that staff door unless you want him found in the harbor by morning. The Union’s sweeping shelters tonight. Saint Brigid’s ‘counselors’ are cleaning their own mess. You keep him close, you’re painting a target on his back—and yours.”

From the storm grate under the window by your booth, a thin ribbon of rainwater suddenly burps up, carrying a wad of damp wax paper that lodges against the curb. Something stiff inside it catches the light—paper, folded tight, edges striped with ink.

**Status updates:** Kitchen handle released. Headlights fixed on café. Wax-paper parcel at curb.
