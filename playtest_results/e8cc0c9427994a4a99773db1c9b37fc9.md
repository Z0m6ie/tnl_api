### Turn 4 [PLAYER]

Mara Kade is a disgraced colonial marine who survived a black-site evacuation that everyone in command insists never happened. Now she works as a contracted security escort on deep-space salvage runs, always armed and always expecting betrayal. Hard-edged, hypervigilant, and brutally pragmatic, she keeps people alive by assuming the worst and acting first. She’s determined to find the missing crew from that erased operation—and make someone in power pay for leaving them to die.

*Agent reasoning: Generated aggressive-style character for Sci-Fi Horror Survival*

### Turn 5 [GAME]

Here's your character:

**Mara Kade**
*Contracted security escort for deep-space salvage operations (ex-colonial marine)*

Once a decorated colonial marine, Mara became a pariah after the evacuation of a classified black-site facility—an operation her former command now denies ever occurred. The official story brands her unstable and insubordinate, but the scars on her body and the gaps in her memory say otherwise. She survives by taking security contracts on deep-space salvage runs, keeping her head down while quietly hunting for the truth behind the erased mission and the crew who never came home.

**Traits:** Hard-edged and disciplined, Hypervigilant and suspicious, Brutally pragmatic under pressure, Protective of civilians and crewmates, Vengeful toward corrupt authority
**Goal:** Track down the missing crew from the erased black-site operation, uncover who ordered the abandonment, and force someone powerful to answer for it—alive if possible, dead if necessary.

### Turn 9 [GAME]

Cold starlight leaks through the tug’s warped viewport and stains the corridor blue and rust. Fans tick in the ceiling and the bulkheads pop as the hull shrinks and loosens with every temperature swing. The air tastes of oxidized metal and old coolant, with a faint sweet bite that doesn’t belong in recycled systems.

Mara Kade moves down the passage in a slow, measured walk, rifle low, eyes never still. She checks each hatch seam with two fingers, feels the vibration of the deck plates, and watches her boot soles stick for a half-step when the gravity sputters, then peel free with a wet sound.

Her wrist slate chirps once and throws a Guild ping across her visor, encrypted and tagged with the Salvagers’ Guild seal—the “union” that sells safety on paper and coordinates in the dark. The lot number means nothing, but the nav offsets do, because only military suites bury errors that way. A partial audio clip rides in the packet, a voice saying “Mara” like a prayer, then a wet choke and hard silence.

She turns toward the bridge to confirm the course change. The corridor lights dip and recover, like a blink. The tapping cable she’d been tracking stops mid-rhythm.

No footfalls answer her own. No engine-thrum shifts with the pilot’s hands. The comm line opens on its own and breathes static between words, like someone holding a mic in their teeth.

Mara reaches the bridge hatch and finds it unlatched. The bridge beyond sits empty, chairs still warm, consoles lit, and the tug drifts on a steady burn toward the Kestrel Drift. A new beacon pings on the sensor stack—Colonial Security Bureau sweep code, the kind that “inspects” crews and makes witnesses disappear—and it’s close enough to taste.

### Turn 10 [PLAYER]

I slam the bridge hatch shut and dog it, then trigger a shipwide lockdown from the nearest console—seal interior doors, kill nonessential comms, and switch cameras to my visor feed. “Crew, sound off now or I start shooting locks,” I bark into the intercom while yanking nav and comm logs for the last ten minutes and pinging sensors for life signs and boarders.

*Agent reasoning: Bridge is empty but chairs are warm—crew didn’t leave willingly. CSB sweep inbound means we’re about to get erased. I need answers fast: lock ship down, pull logs, arm up, and find the crew before whatever’s on board does.*

### Turn 11 [GAME]



### Turn 12 [PLAYER]

I re-dog the bridge hatch and slam my palm on the lockdown controls: seal internal doors, route all cams to my visor, and cut external comms to receive-only. “Sound off, now—names and locations—or I start cutting doors,” I snarl over intercom while I rip the last ten minutes of nav/comm logs and run a quick sweep for life signs and unauthorized transponders.

*Agent reasoning: Bridge was open and the crew vanished—either boarders or something inside. I need control of the ship, eyes everywhere, and bodies accounted for fast before CSB gets in range.*
