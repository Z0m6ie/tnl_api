### Turn 4 [PLAYER]

Mara Kestrel grew up scavenging the drowned outskirts after the Collapse took her family and her home. A former municipal engineer turned tunnel-runner, she maps dead infrastructure and guides escape routes through sealed floodways. Focused, unsentimental, and relentlessly pragmatic, she cuts through panic and superstition with blunt plans and hard limits. Her goal is to reach the rumored upland grid station and restart enough power to buy one clean corridor out—no matter who has to be left behind.

*Agent reasoning: Generated speedrunner-style character for Post-Apocalyptic Escape*

### Turn 5 [GAME]

Here's your character:

**Mara Kestrel**
*Former municipal engineer turned tunnel-runner and escape-route mapper*

Mara Kestrel survived the Collapse by scavenging the drowned outskirts, where rising water and collapsing concrete took her family along with her home. Once a municipal engineer, she repurposed her knowledge of civil plans and maintenance corridors into a life as a tunnel-runner, learning which sealed floodways still breathe and which ones kill. She carries a waterlogged set of annotated utility maps and a hard-earned belief that sentiment gets people trapped.

**Traits:** Focused, Relentlessly pragmatic, Bluntly honest, Risk-calculating, Unsympathetic to superstition
**Goal:** Reach the rumored upland grid station and restore enough power to open and hold a single clean corridor out, even if it means abandoning anyone who slows the escape.

### Turn 9 [GAME]

Morning, low tide, at the **Junction of Nine**—a ring of half-submerged service platforms where four maintenance corridors meet under a cracked transit atrium. Salt-stale air hangs heavy. Water slaps the stairwell below, then sucks back, dragging grit. Your headlamp beam catches blistered paint and a curtain of dripping cable.

You kneel on a dry patch of poured concrete and unroll your waterlogged utility sheets on a rusted cable tray. The paper fights you, swollen and soft. You pin corners with bolts from your pocket and mark a new line with a grease pencil: a bypass around a collapsed pump room, measured by count and slope like you’re back in a survey crew. You check ceiling seams for fresh seep and tap a conduit with your wrench—listening for hollow, for hidden voids.

Boots scrape behind you. Three people step into the light: a Tidewarden in a patched dive coat with an air-hose looped over one shoulder; a thin Choir tech with a handheld meter and copper token chain; and a Rebar Court bailiff with a rebar baton and a slate board. They don’t look at each other. They look at your maps.

The bailiff flips the slate toward you. Your name is chalked under a stamped seal: **SALVAGE WRIT—STOLEN INFRASTRUCTURE**. “Court says you return what you took,” he says, baton resting across his forearm. The Tidewarden cuts in, voice calm. “We can make that go away. Air credit, a dry corridor. You come talk to our captain.” The Choir tech raises the meter; its needle trembles. “No talk,” she says. “Verification. Now. You have something that sings upland.”

Then you see it: on the pillar beside the north tunnel, a fresh stenciled mark—new paint, wrong code—half-hidden under algae smear. And from the flooded shaft below the atrium comes the same rhythmic banging, closer than yesterday, steady as a pump that won’t prime.

All three wait, blocking three exits. Your maps are open, your pack is at your feet, and the ceramic isolator is a hard weight against your ribs. You have seconds to choose who you face—and whether you move before the banging reaches the stairs.

### Turn 10 [PLAYER]

I snap my maps up in one motion, shove them into my coat, and kick my pack strap onto my shoulder. “You can all file your paperwork after we’re not dead—move.” I feint toward the bailiff’s side like I’m surrendering, then cut hard for the north tunnel, headlamp sweeping the fresh stencil as I run.

*Agent reasoning: Three factions want leverage; none matter if whatever’s banging reaches us. Fastest path is the unblocked exit—north—with the weird fresh stencil as a clue. Create a split-second distraction, grab essentials, move.*

### Turn 11 [GAME]

Your maps slap together wetly as you snap them up; the paper nearly tears at a fold, but you get it bundled and jammed under your coat. The pack strap catches, then slides onto your shoulder with a jolt that knocks your headlamp beam sideways across the pillar.

“Move,” you bark.

The bailiff reads the feint as compliance for half a heartbeat—his baton dips—then you cut hard. His eyes widen and he lunges, rebar baton swinging low for your shin. It clips your boot instead of bone, sparks off a metal edge, and you stumble but keep your feet.

The Tidewarden reacts faster than the others: he steps across the north tunnel mouth, blocking it with his shoulder and the looped air-hose like a garrote. “No,” he says, flat. He grabs for your coat front.

You slam into him at speed. Your shoulder drives him back a step onto slick silt; his boots skid. The Choir tech doesn’t chase—she raises her meter and snaps two short words that sound like procedure, not a prayer. The needle pegs, and your headlamp flickers once, then steadies—like something just drank a bite of current nearby.

Your beam catches the fresh stencil in full as you pass it: the same wrong-code mark, painted over old flake, still glossy at the edges. Under it, someone has scratched a tiny arrow pointing deeper into the north tunnel.

Behind you, the bailiff shouts, “Writ in force! Stop her!” He’s coming, heavy-footed. The Tidewarden, off-balance, recovers and reaches again—fingers snagging your pack strap. The strap bites into his hand; he yanks, trying to pull you back into the atrium.

Then the banging changes: not below anymore. It answers from inside the north tunnel—two impacts, a pause, two impacts—close enough you feel it through the concrete.

Ahead, the north corridor is half-lit by your lamp: a maintenance run with hanging cable bundles and a shallow sheet of water over the floor. Fifty feet in, something pale breaks the surface and slides back under—fast, deliberate—leaving a V-wake through scum.

You are not clear yet. The Tidewarden has your strap, the bailiff is closing, and whatever is making that rhythm is now in the tunnel with you.

### Turn 12 [PLAYER]

I hiss, “Keep it,” and knife the pack strap free so it drops into his hands and the water. Then I sprint deeper, jump for the nearest wall ladder/cable tray supports to get my boots out of the sheet water, and keep moving above the surface toward the scratched arrow.

*Agent reasoning: Strap grab will get me pinned between hunters and whatever’s in the water; fastest is to ditch weight, break contact, get to high ground off the flooded floor.*

### Turn 13 [GAME]

Your knife flashes. You hook the strap where it crosses your chest and saw once, hard. The webbing parts with a dry snap.

The pack drops straight into the Tidewarden’s hands and then into the sheet water with a heavy slap. He grunts—more surprised than hurt—then immediately clamps both hands on it like it’s evidence. “Fine,” he spits, and you hear the hose on his shoulder clack as he turns back toward the atrium, already calling, “She ditched her load—north tunnel!”

You sprint. The shallow water tries to steal your boots with every step, but you hit the wall and jump, fingers catching a corroded cable tray support and a rung of an old side-ladder bolted into the concrete. Rust flakes into your palms. The first rung flexes; it holds.

You haul yourself up and start moving sideways and forward along the ladder line, boots scraping for purchase on narrow brackets just above the waterline. Below you, something moves again—pale, quick—tracking the line of your shadow more than your body. It bumps the wall once, hard, and the vibration shivers up the ladder into your arms.

Behind, the bailiff enters the tunnel mouth and stops short when he sees you climb. “Get down!” he barks, baton raised like it can reach you. He won’t wade in fast; he keeps to the dry edge, scanning.

Ahead, you follow the scratched arrow. Twenty feet deeper, it points to a service recess: a metal access panel half-hidden behind hanging cable bundles. The panel’s bolts are newer than everything around it—clean heads, bright edges. Someone has been here recently.

The rhythmic banging is right under that recess now, from inside the wall or the flooded cavity behind it: two hits, pause, two hits—patient and close.

As you reach the recess, the ladder section you’re on gives a sharp creak. One of the brackets has pulled a few millimeters out of the concrete, leaving a fresh crescent of crumbling aggregate. If you keep your full weight on it much longer, it’s going to tear free.

```

### Turn 14 [PLAYER]

I shift my weight back, then lunge into the recess, grabbing cables for leverage as I plant both boots on whatever dry lip I can find. “Bailiff—stay out of the water unless you want it on you,” I snap, and immediately start wrenching at the newer bolts on the access panel with my knife/wrench, fast and sloppy.

*Agent reasoning: Ladder’s failing and something’s in the water; fastest is to get off the bracket, get into the recess, and use the new bolts/panel as the intended route—also blocks pursuit.*

### Turn 15 [GAME]

You shift your weight back just enough to unhook from the failing bracket, then lunge. Your hands fist a bundle of hanging cables—rubber slick with condensation—and you swing into the recess. Your boots find a narrow dry lip: a raised concrete curb inside the alcove. It holds. The ladder behind you gives a final protesting groan but doesn’t tear out—not yet.

“Bailiff—stay out of the water unless you want it on you,” you snap.

The bailiff halts at the edge, eyes flicking to the water where the pale shape just traced another fast line under the scum. He swallows, then tries to save face by lifting his baton toward you like a gavel. “You’re under writ,” he says, but he doesn’t step in.

You get your wrench on the first new bolt. The head is clean, not rounded—whoever set it wanted it removable. Fast and sloppy works for the first two: they squeal and come free, dropping into the recess with sharp pings.

On the third, your wrench slips—your hand is wet, the rubber cable jacket smears against your palm—and you skin your knuckles on the panel edge. Blood beads immediately in the cold air.

The banging stops.

For a half-second there’s only the drip of cable and your breathing—then something hits the access panel from behind, hard. The metal bows outward with a dull *thoom* and rebounds. Dust puffs from the seam. The remaining bolts jump in their holes.

Below your boots, in the waterline at the recess mouth, the pale thing surfaces long enough for you to see it: not a fish. A forearm—human, swollen and bleached—ending in a hand that shouldn’t still have grip. It hooks fingers into the recess’s lower edge and pulls, steady and purposeful, as if it heard the bolt squeal and homed in on it.

Behind you, from the tunnel mouth, the Tidewarden’s voice carries closer now, urgent. “Don’t open anything! Kestrel—step away from the panel!”

The bailiff takes one involuntary step back from the water, baton up, and says quieter, “What the hell is that?”

The access panel bulges again—two impacts, pause, two impacts—now coming from directly behind it, like something is testing the last fasteners. Your next wrench-turn will either open it… or leave you in a recess with a climbing hand at your feet and whatever’s inside the wall trying to get out.

### Turn 16 [PLAYER]

I yank my bleeding hand back, wipe it on my sleeve, and kick the loose bolts into the water at the pale hand. “Congrats—your writ can arrest that,” I bark at the bailiff, then shove off the recess lip and move fast along the wall supports past the arrow, keeping my boots out of the water and my eyes on the surface for another grab.

*Agent reasoning: Opening that panel is a gamble with a thing already trying to get out; speedrun move is disengage, use the bailiff/Tidewarden as distraction, and get past the threat via the marked route without feeding it blood.*

### Turn 17 [GAME]

You wipe the blood off on your sleeve; it smears dark and wet. You hook a boot under the two loose bolts and flick them out.

They plink into the sheet water and skip once, right toward the pale hand. The hand flinches—not away, but down—submerging with a quick, practiced dip. The bolts vanish under the scum with it.

“Congrats—your writ can arrest that,” you bark.

The bailiff’s face tightens. He raises the baton like he’s about to answer—then the water near the recess dimples and slides, and he chooses distance instead. “Court doesn’t cover… *that*,” he mutters, backing toward the tunnel mouth without taking his eyes off the surface.

You shove off the recess lip and catch the wall supports again, moving fast. The bracket line shudders under your weight; rust flakes rain into the water. You keep your boots off the surface, skimming along narrow metal tabs and ladder rungs.

Behind you, the access panel gives a long, ugly groan—metal flexing. A seam opens a finger-width with a sound like tearing foil. Something inside exhales a breath of warmer air that fogs the recess for an instant.

Then the water answers: a sudden surge straight up at the recess mouth. The pale arm comes out higher than before, not grabbing blindly—reaching for the supports you’re using. Fingers rake the wall, miss your heel by inches, and slap back into the water with a loud smack.

Ahead, past the arrow, the wall supports continue—but the next section is partially collapsed: two rungs are missing, leaving a gap over the water about the length of your body. Beyond the gap, the tunnel bends left into darker conduit haze.

From behind, the Tidewarden is closer now, boots splashing at the edge where the water is thinnest. He shouts, “Mara! Don’t—” and then cuts off as the water near him ripples in a straight line, moving away from the recess and toward the tunnel mouth like something is redirecting.

The threat is immediate and specific now: the thing in the water is learning your route along the wall, and you’ve got a rung-gap coming up that will force a jump or a drop—right as the surface starts to move toward the people behind you.

### Turn 18 [PLAYER]

I commit to the jump—hands to the last solid rung, swing my legs and launch across the missing section to catch the far rung/bracket, hauling up without touching the water. “Back up, Tidewarden—it's tracking movement on the wall!” I shout over my shoulder, then keep moving into the left bend, headlamp low on the waterline watching for another grab.

*Agent reasoning: Gap jump is faster than dropping into water; I’ll use the pursuing ripples to my advantage by forcing the others to back off and buying myself seconds.*

### Turn 19 [GAME]

You commit. Both hands clamp the last solid rung; you swing your legs hard to build momentum, then launch.

For a half-second you’re over open water and nothing else—then your fingers catch the far bracket. It bites into your palms through rust and grit. The bracket flexes and spits a little concrete dust, but it holds. You kick once against the wall, get a boot on a narrow tab, and haul your weight up without breaking the surface.

Your headlamp beam, kept low, skates over the waterline. You catch a pale streak just under the film, pacing you—too smooth to be floating drift.

“Back up, Tidewarden—it’s tracking movement on the wall!” you shout.

The Tidewarden, now visible at the edge behind the bailiff, hesitates mid-step. He lifts his hands as if to steady himself, then actually does back up two paces onto higher rubble. “Bull,” he calls, but his voice cracks on the last word. He’s watching the water, not you.

The bailiff uses the moment to retreat another step, baton lowered. “You hear her,” he snaps at the diver, then, softer, “Don’t be stupid.”

You keep moving into the left bend. The air changes immediately—less open tunnel, more enclosed conduit. The wall supports continue but are slicker here, coated in algae smear where the mist never dries. Your lamp reveals drag marks on the concrete at shoulder height, as if something heavy has been hauled along the wall recently.

Behind you, metal shrieks: the access panel finally gives way. It doesn’t explode outward; it peels open with a slow, wrenching tear and then *clangs* against something inside. A breath of dry, warm air rolls down the tunnel—cleaner than it should be.

The water reacts as if a current turned on. The surface pulls toward the bend you’re entering, tugging floating grit with it in a thin, steady stream. The pale shape follows that pull, accelerating.

Then the grab comes—not from below your feet, but from the wall itself ahead: a hand shoots out of a fist-sized maintenance hole at knee height, fingers snapping for your boot as you pass. It misses by a hair and scrapes rust off the bracket with a shrill *skrrt*.

Whatever is in here isn’t just in the water anymore. It’s using the wall cavities—and it’s now between you and the deeper dark of the bend.

### Turn 20 [PLAYER]

I jerk back, then stomp my heel hard into the maintenance hole to crush fingers/force it shut, and immediately climb up to the highest reachable rung to get above knee-level. Headlamp swings ahead hunting for the nearest side hatch/valve niche to duck into and slam closed behind me.

*Agent reasoning: Wall-grabber means this path is compromised; speedrun move is to break line-of-contact and get vertical or into a side hatch fast, not keep pacing along predictable brackets.*

### Turn 21 [GAME]

You jerk back and drive your heel into the maintenance hole.

Your boot hits fingers—there’s resistance like wet rope over bone—then a crack you feel up your shin. The hand spasms and withdraws, leaving a smear of pale skin and dark fluid on the rim. Your heel wedges for a beat, then you wrench it free; the hole is still open, but whatever was in it isn’t reaching anymore.

You climb—fast, ugly—up to the highest rung you can reach. The algae-slick metal tries to throw you, but you get both hands locked and pull your chest above knee-level. You’re now a full rung-and-a-half higher than before, boots planted on a narrow crosspiece, shoulders near the ceiling line.

Your headlamp swings ahead and catches a side niche: an old valve recess cut into the wall about six meters forward, half-height, with a corroded wheel and a steel access door hanging slightly ajar on one hinge. It’s not sealed; it’s a place to duck, not a bunker.

The water below you is moving with intent now—streaming toward the bend. The pale thing breaks the surface briefly, not fully emerging: just enough to show a slack jaw and one eye filmed over, then it submerges again and slides along the wall under your supports as if following the fastest line.

Behind you, the torn access panel clatters again. Something bumps it from the other side, testing the opening. Warm air continues to breathe out in pulses, like a vent line cycling.

The Tidewarden’s voice echoes from back down the tunnel, farther now—he really did retreat. “Kestrel! Get out of there—Court won’t pay your lungs back!”

As you shift your weight to move toward the valve niche, the rung you’re on gives a sharp *ping*. One of its anchor points has started to pull from the concrete—freshly stressed by your climb. You can keep moving, but the supports are no longer “safe”; they’re actively failing under you, one load at a time.

### Turn 22 [PLAYER]

I lunge along the supports to the valve recess and drop into it, planting both boots on the niche’s concrete lip. I shoulder-check the hanging steel door to swing it as closed as it’ll go and jam my wrench through the wheel/spokes as a crude brace, then flick my headlamp down the waterline and listen for the next grab.

*Agent reasoning: The supports are failing; I need stable ground fast. The valve niche is the nearest “platform,” even if it won’t seal—use it to get off the rungs and buy seconds to choose the next route.*

### Turn 23 [GAME]

You lunge along the supports—one, two rungs—then drop into the valve recess.

Your boots hit the concrete lip solidly. The niche is just deep enough to get your shoulders out of the tunnel’s main line, and the air inside is drier, dustier. Rust scabs flake off the valve wheel when you grab it.

You shoulder-check the hanging steel door. It swings inward with a grinding shriek, but the bottom edge drags on warped concrete and stops with a fist-wide gap still open near the floor. The hinge is half-sheared; the door won’t seat.

You reach for your wrench on instinct—then your hand closes on empty belt webbing.

You don’t have a wrench.

The realization costs you a beat. You shove the valve wheel instead, trying to use the spokes as a brace point, but the wheel turns freely a quarter turn with a wet, internal gurgle. Somewhere behind the wall, water shifts. The wheel isn’t locked; it’s connected to something that still moves.

You flick your headlamp down the waterline through the gap.

The surface outside the recess is sliding past like a slow conveyor. Then it stops—right at your doorway gap—as if a current hit a dead-end. The film trembles.

A pale hand rises from the water and finds the bottom edge of the door immediately, fingers feeling along the gap with purpose. Not searching the tunnel—searching *you*. Nails click on steel.

Above that hand, under the scum, a face presses up again, closer: slack mouth working soundlessly, one eye milked over, the other fixed on the light beam. It doesn’t lunge; it waits, holding the door edge like it’s testing how much give it has.

From the tunnel behind, you hear a metallic thump—different from the water-slap. The torn access panel being struck again, harder, and then a second sound: a short burst of rapid tapping, like knuckles on conduit, answering itself in the bend.

The Tidewarden’s voice is distant now, muffled by the curve. “Mara—? You alive?”

The immediate threat is at the gap: the thing has purchase on the door and is starting to pull, slow and steady, while your “brace” is a valve wheel that can still turn—and may be opening something you don’t want opened.

### Turn 24 [PLAYER]

I stomp down on the pale fingers through the gap, then yank off my belt/strap and ram it into the door’s bottom as a crude wedge. “Alive—moving,” I shout toward the Tidewarden, then kill my headlamp and slip back out of the niche onto the wall supports, pushing into the bend as fast as I can without touching the water.

*Agent reasoning: Door won’t seal and I lost my wrench; fastest is to deny it the gap and get moving. Valve wheel is risky—stop turning it. Use whatever’s on me to jam the bottom and bail out before it pulls through.*

### Turn 25 [GAME]

Your boot comes down hard on the fingers probing the gap. Bone gives with a brittle snap; the hand spasms and slips, leaving two crushed digits caught for a moment under the door edge before the rest withdraws into the water.

You rip your belt free and ram the strap into the bottom gap, folding it over itself and stuffing it tight like a gasket. The door shudders as you shove; the hinge squeals, but the strap takes up most of the space. It’s not airtight, but it’s enough to deny a clean reach-through.

“Alive—moving!” your shout bounces down the tunnel.

The Tidewarden answers immediately, closer than you thought: boots scraping, not running but repositioning. “Copy! Don’t go dark—” he starts, then cuts himself off as if realizing you already might.

You kill your headlamp.

Dark snaps shut like a fist. In the first second, you’ve got only afterimages: the doorway rectangle, the sheen of water.

You slip back out onto the wall supports by feel. Your hands find the cold metal; you swing a boot onto the crosspiece and push into the bend.

The supports betray you almost immediately. The rung you load gives a sharp, tearing *krk* as its anchor pulls another centimeter out of the concrete. You catch yourself with your forearms, scraping skin, and keep moving—faster now because stopping will drop you.

Below, the waterline sounds change: less slosh, more deliberate scraping as something tracks the wall right under you. Twice you feel a faint vibration through the support brackets, like knuckles tapping from the other side of the concrete.

Behind you, the valve door in the niche bangs once—hard—then again, slower. The strap wedge holds, but each hit makes the hinge complain.

Ahead, in the bend, you smell it before you see it: dry dust and hot metal. A faint, steady hum—electrical, not wind—threads through the dark. Then your shin clips something hanging from the ceiling: a loop of cable or wire, swaying. It brushes your leg and continues to swing, ticking softly against a bracket.

And in that same moment, something in the water surges forward under you, fast enough to throw a small wave against the wall. The splash hits the supports; droplets patter on your boots.

You’re in the bend now, moving blind, with failing anchors behind you, a thing pacing below, and a live-sounding hum ahead that could mean power—or a trap.  

```json
{"inventory_add":[],"inventory_remove":["belt/strap"],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":[],"npcs_add":[]}
```

### Turn 26 [PLAYER]

I flick the headlamp on for a quick flash-scan ahead—looking for a dry catwalk, junction box alcove, or door I can get onto—and immediately reach up to yank the hanging cable out of my path. If there’s a dry ledge, I climb up/off the supports onto it; if not, I keep moving forward on the highest brackets, hugging the wall and staying clear of the water.

*Agent reasoning: Blind + failing rungs + live power hum = trip/electrocution risk. Fastest is get light back on briefly, avoid water, and climb off the wall supports onto any dry service ledge/doorway near the power source.*

### Turn 27 [GAME]

You snap the headlamp on—just a heartbeat.

The beam punches through mist and shows the bend opening into a service stretch: a narrow, grated catwalk runs along the right wall about chest-high, bolted into the concrete with stanchions. Half of it is intact and dry; the far section dips where a stanchion has sheared, the grating twisted down toward the water. Above the catwalk is a junction box alcove: a recessed cabinet with its door missing, exposing ceramic insulators and a bundle of blackened conductors. The hum you heard is coming from there—faint, steady, and wrong for a dead district.

In that same flash you also catch the hanging “cable” you clipped: it isn’t loose utility line. It’s a looped length of catenary wire with a ceramic isolator tied in-line—cleaner than the rest, recently handled. It’s been hung deliberately at shin height like a snare.

You reach up and yank it aside.

The wire doesn’t give like slack line; it bites back. It snaps taut and the ceramic isolator swings up and smacks the bracket near your head with a sharp *clack*. The loop whips across your forearm, scraping hard—then the whole rig jerks toward the junction alcove as if it’s tethered there. Something in the box clicks once, like a relay engaging.

The hum rises a notch.

Below you, the water surges again—this time not just a wave. A shoulder or back breaks the surface under the catwalk section, sliding fast. It’s using the wall and your supports like a guide rail, keeping pace with your movement.

You don’t wait. You hook an elbow over the nearest catwalk stanchion and haul yourself up off the failing brackets. The grating is cold and gritty under your boots—dry enough to trust for now. The twisted, sagging section is about four meters ahead; you can see where it drops toward the water like a ramp.

Behind you, from the dark, the Tidewarden’s voice carries closer and sharper: “Light! I saw it—keep it on, I’m coming to you!”

From the junction alcove, you hear a second, softer sound layered under the hum: that same rhythmic tapping you heard earlier—now right here, answering from inside the wall cavity behind the cabinet.

### Turn 28 [PLAYER]

“Stop where you are, Tidewarden—there’s a live snare and a hot box!” I hiss, then lunge into the junction alcove and rip the conductors free from the insulators (yanking anything feeding that hum). Without waiting to see if it dies, I sprint the catwalk and jump the sagging section, grabbing the far stanchion and hauling myself onto the intact grating beyond.

*Agent reasoning: Snare + live power + something in the wall = trap zone. Fastest is to get past the sagging ramp before the water thing uses it; don’t let the Tidewarden blunder in. Disable the box if it’s feeding the snare, then sprint the catwalk.*

### Turn 29 [GAME]



### Turn 30 [PLAYER]

“Stop where you are, Tidewarden—live snare, hot box!” I dart into the junction alcove and yank the feed conductors off the insulators until the hum dies, then sprint the catwalk and leap the sagging section, grabbing the far stanchion to haul myself onto solid grating.

*Agent reasoning: Blank output means the scene didn’t advance; I’ll restate the same fast, high-priority move: warn Tidewarden, kill power at the hot box, clear the catwalk gap.*

### Turn 31 [GAME]

“Stop where you are—live snare, hot box!” your voice comes out thin in the concrete throat, but it carries.

The Tidewarden checks himself mid-step. You hear his boots skid on grit. “Hot?” he barks back, and then—more cautious—“Where?”

You don’t answer. You dive into the junction alcove.

Up close, it’s a butchered cabinet: older ceramic insulators, but the conductors are newer—black jacket intact, lugs recently crimped. Your hands close on the first pair and you rip.

The hum doesn’t die. It *jumps*—a higher pitch—and the cable in your grip kicks like a live animal. A white-blue snap pops at the lug and heat bites your palm. The smell of ozone and burnt rubber blooms instantly.

You wrench again, harder, and the second pull tears a conductor free. This time the hum stutters, drops for half a second… then comes back lower, steadier. Whatever’s feeding it isn’t only this cabinet.

From behind the cabinet, inside the wall void, the tapping accelerates: *tap-tap-tap-tap*—close enough you feel it through the concrete.

Below the catwalk, the thing in the water reacts to the commotion. It surges forward and *hits* the sagging section from underneath. The twisted grating flexes downward with a metallic groan and a spray of brackish water spits up through the gaps.

You’re already moving.

You sprint along the catwalk; the intact grating rattles under your feet. At the sagging break you commit—jumping the dip.

Your boots clear the worst of it, but the far edge is slick with algae. Your hands slap the far stanchion; you catch it, swing, and haul yourself up onto the solid section beyond. The stanchion holds, vibrating from the impact.

Behind you, the sagging section gives another tortured *screee* as something heavy drags along its underside. A pale shape rolls just under the surface—long back, no clear limbs—using the catwalk’s shadow like cover.

The Tidewarden, still back in the tunnel, doesn’t come closer. You hear him unclip something—metal on metal—and he shouts, “Stay there! I’m not stepping into a live run—tell me what you touched!”

In the junction alcove you left, the loose conductor end you tore free spits once more—then goes dark. The hum remains, faint but present, now coming from deeper ahead along the wall, as if the line is still energized somewhere past your position.

### Turn 32 [PLAYER]

I shake my burned hand once, then shout back, “Cabinet’s been re-fed—still hot farther ahead. Snare wire at shin height before the catwalk; don’t touch the wall, don’t step onto the sag.”  
I keep moving forward on the intact grating, headlamp low and sweeping for another junction/door or ladder up, staying as far from the humming wall-run as the catwalk allows.

*Agent reasoning: My hand’s cooked and the line’s still live somewhere ahead; fastest is to avoid the energized wall, keep moving to a safer node, and give the Tidewarden only the essentials so he doesn’t blunder into the snare.*

### Turn 33 [GAME]

You shake your hand; the burn has already raised a wet blister across the base of your thumb and two fingers. Your grip still works, but it stings with every flex.

Your warning echoes back down the tunnel.

The Tidewarden answers immediately, voice tighter. “Copy. I’m backing out.” You hear him retreat—boots on grit, then a splash as he steps off the drier lip into shallow water to widen his path away from the wall. A moment later: the hiss of a valve and the hollow *clunk* of a tank being shouldered. He’s not leaving; he’s repositioning.

You keep moving.

The intact catwalk runs straight for another ten meters before it doglegs left around a support pier. Your headlamp stays low, beam scraping the grating and the base of the wall-run. The humming line is clearly visible now: a bundled conduit strapped to the concrete with fresh metal bands—newer than anything else here. Every few meters a ceramic standoff insulator keeps it off the wall.

Ahead, you find three things in quick succession:

1) **A ladder up**: bolted rungs disappearing into a ceiling hatch. The hatch is shut, and there’s a **fresh smear of sealant** around its rim—recent, not cracked. Someone has been through and tried to keep it dry.

2) **A painted mark** on the pier at the dogleg: the same stenciled symbol you’ve been seeing—partly scrubbed, then repainted over.

3) **Another snare**: a thin, dark line stretched at ankle height across the catwalk just before the dogleg. It’s not catenary wire this time—looks like braided cord or stripped cable jacket, tied off to the conduit bands on the humming wall-run. If you’d kept your pace, you’d have hit it.

Below you, the pale shape tracks your movement. It stays just under the surface, parallel to the catwalk, and when you reach the dogleg it *bumps* the underside of the grating directly beneath the snare—testing, like it knows where you are.

From behind, the Tidewarden calls again, closer than he should be if he was “backing out.” He’s moved to a new angle. “Engineer! Don’t climb. That hatch is Court-sealed in this sector. You go up there, you’ll have every bailiff in Nine on you.”

The tapping you heard earlier answers from inside the pier at your left—right behind the painted mark—slow and deliberate now, like knuckles on the other side of a door.

### Turn 34 [PLAYER]

I crouch and step over the ankle snare without touching the humming conduit, then grab the ladder and start climbing. “Court can bill me—your ‘sealed’ hatch is the only dry exit; cover the catwalk and don’t come closer,” I call back, keeping my headlamp angled down so I can see if anything follows.

*Agent reasoning: Fastest safe path is up the ladder; Court trouble later beats getting dragged into the water now. Snare needs bypass, and the tapping-mark pier might be a side threat—ignore unless it blocks me.*

### Turn 35 [GAME]

You step over the ankle snare cleanly, careful not to brush the humming wall-run. The cord trembles faintly anyway—your pant leg’s wake of air is enough to make it quiver—then settles.

You grab the ladder rungs. Cold metal, slick with condensation. You start climbing.

Two rungs up, the hum changes pitch—subtle, like a transformer taking load. The conduit bands along the wall-run shiver, and the ceramic standoffs give a tiny *tick… tick…* as they flex. Whatever this line is feeding, it just noticed you.

Below, your headlamp angled down catches movement: the pale shape in the water slides to the base of the ladder well and rises until it presses against the underside of the catwalk. You see a long, smooth back break the surface for a second—no eyes, no clear mouth—just a wet ridge and a sudden *thump* as it rams the grating once, hard, directly under your feet.

The ladder vibrates. You keep climbing.

Behind you, the Tidewarden ignores your order. You hear him advance at a jog, then stop short of the snare. “Mara—don’t—” he starts, then cuts himself off as the water below the catwalk surges. He raises something—your lamp catches a brief flash of metal and a loop of line. A spear-gun or a harpoon rig.

He shouts, not at you now but at the water: “HEY! OFF!”

At the dogleg pier, right beside the painted mark, the tapping becomes a sharp, fast *RAP-RAP-RAP* from inside the concrete. Then a new sound: the grind of something turning—like a cam or latch.

You reach the hatch. There’s no wheel, no handle—just a recessed pull and a seam packed with fresh sealant. You hook your fingers into the recess and pull.

It doesn’t open.

The seam *gives* slightly, stretching the sealant like taffy, and you feel the hatch shift maybe a millimeter—then stop against a hard catch. Locked from the other side.

Below, the pale thing hits the catwalk again—twice—trying to deform the grating under the ladder. The Tidewarden fires: a compressed *THUNK* and a line snaps out, striking the water with a splash. The creature rolls away from the impact, but it doesn’t flee; it circles back under the ladder’s shadow.

From inside the pier, the grinding stops. A thin, vertical crack appears in a maintenance panel you hadn’t noticed—right at shoulder height on the pier—and a sliver of dry air leaks out, carrying the clean, sharp smell of ozone and warm dust. Someone is opening something *in the wall* near the painted mark.

### Turn 36 [PLAYER]

I drop back down fast, land light on the catwalk, and move straight for the cracked maintenance panel by the painted mark. “Tidewarden—keep it off the ladder, I’m taking the wall,” I snap, then jam my fingers into the crack and yank the panel open.

*Agent reasoning: Hatch is a dead end and the catwalk’s getting hammered; the wall panel opening is the only fast “dry” route. I need to get off the ladder before the grating deforms and drops me.*

### Turn 37 [GAME]



### Turn 38 [PLAYER]

I drop down the ladder two rungs at a time, hit the catwalk in a crouch, and beeline to the cracked panel by the painted mark. “Tidewarden—keep it off the ladder, I’m taking the wall,” I bark, then jam my fingers into the seam and wrench the maintenance panel open.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is locked and the wall panel is actively opening—fastest path forward is through that access before it closes, while the Tidewarden distracts the water-thing.*

### Turn 39 [GAME]



*Triggered: guard_Crouch_0_8f1d4d*

### Turn 40 [PLAYER]

I drop down the ladder two rungs at a time, hit the catwalk in a crouch, and sprint to the cracked maintenance panel by the painted mark. “Tidewarden—keep it off the ladder, I’m taking the wall,” I bark, then jam my burned hand into the seam and wrench the panel open.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is locked; the cracked panel is the only opening and it’s already being unlatched from inside. Move fast before the water-thing or the Tidewarden complicates it.*

### Turn 41 [GAME]

You come down the ladder hard—two rungs at a time—boots slapping wet metal. The catwalk flexes under your landing.

The pale thing takes that moment. It surges up under the grating and *slams* the underside right where you touch down. The jolt shoots up your shins and nearly pitches you forward, but you catch yourself in a crouch and drive into a sprint.

“Keep it off the ladder,” you snap.

The Tidewarden doesn’t answer with words—he plants his feet wide, braces his harpoon rig against the ladder frame, and yanks the line tight like he’s trying to turn the whole ladder into a barrier. “MOVE!” he barks, voice cracking with effort.

You reach the cracked maintenance panel by the painted mark. Up close it’s not a normal access door—its screws are new, mismatched, and the seam has been cut and re-sealed. The ozone smell is stronger here.

You jam your burned hand into the seam.

The sealant tears with a wet *rip*—and pain knifes up your wrist as the softened skin catches on a sharp, freshly-ground edge. You wrench anyway. The panel pops outward an inch, then fights you on a hidden tether.

Inside is a narrow service void, dry and dusted with concrete flour. A bundle of newer cable—black jacket, clean—runs into a small relay cradle bolted to the inner wall. There’s a faint green indicator LED glowing steady.

And there’s a second thing in there: a trip-strip—thin spring steel—set across the opening at finger height. When you yank the panel wider, it snaps free with a *ping*.

Immediately, somewhere above and behind the pier, you hear a relay *clack* answer it.

The hum in the wall-run rises a notch, and the painted mark beside you—half-scrubbed—shows a fresh edge where something has recently been traced over.

The Tidewarden’s line jerks violently. The pale thing hits again, not the ladder this time—the catwalk stanchion. The whole section shudders, and rusty flakes rain down into the black water.

From the service void, a thin speaker you didn’t see at first emits a dry burst of static, then a human voice—close, controlled, and very calm:

“Hands out of the cradle, Mara Kestrel.”

No one is visible in the void. The voice is coming from the little box itself.

*Triggered: guard_Crouch_0_8f1d4d*

### Turn 42 [PLAYER]

I jerk my burned hand back and spit, “Yeah? Then open something useful.”  
I lean in just enough to sweep my lamp into the service void for a latch/handle or crawlspace continuation, then shout to the Tidewarden, “Catwalk’s coming apart—fallback to the dogleg and keep that thing busy!”

*Agent reasoning: Voice means surveillance and a triggered alarm; best move is grab the quickest exit and avoid touching the relay. The creature is destabilizing the catwalk, so I need a dry route now—either the void is a passage or it’s a trap. Quick check, then commit.*

### Turn 43 [GAME]

You yank your burned hand back; a thin ribbon of skin stays on the fresh metal edge and the sting turns hot, immediate. Your spit hits the catwalk and skitters toward a drain hole.

“Yeah? Then open something useful.”

For a beat there’s only the wall-hum and the Tidewarden’s strained breathing—then the voice in the box answers, still calm. “Useful is relative. Don’t touch the load path.”

You lean in just enough to sweep your lamp into the service void.

The beam shows a crawlspace continuation—tight, rectangular, maybe shoulder-width—running left for a few meters before it kinks downward. There’s a proper handhold rail riveted along the inner lip, and a quick-release latch on a second inner panel… but it’s been wired shut with fresh catenary tie and a wax seal stamped with the upland substation sigil. Whoever did this expected someone like you to look.

Your lamp also catches the relay cradle: ceramic standoffs, a neat coil of new wire, and a small microphone puck. That green LED is steady, not blinking—live and listening.

You shout to the Tidewarden to fall back to the dogleg.

He tries. He unhooks the harpoon rig from the ladder frame and starts shuffling backward along the catwalk, line still tight. “Dogleg—NOW!” he yells, but the movement gives the thing in the water slack.

It uses it.

A pale arm—too long, jointed wrong—hooks up through the grating at the stanchion he just left. Fingers like wet cable ties clamp around the vertical support and *pull*. The stanchion buckles with a metallic groan. The catwalk section between you and the dogleg dips a full handspan, bolts popping one after another like knuckles.

The Tidewarden stumbles, catches the rail, and drags himself onto the more stable dogleg platform, but the harpoon line whips loose and slaps the water—no longer keeping the thing off the ladder or anything else.

The voice in the wall speaks again, closer in your ear through the tiny speaker: “If that span drops, you don’t get a second chance. Get into the void, Mara. Or step away and lose it.”

The catwalk under you is still holding—barely—but the sag is increasing, and the next stanchion is already creaking.

*Triggered: guard_Crouch_0_8f1d4d*

### Turn 44 [PLAYER]

“Fine—your void it is. If you fry me, I haunt your substation.”

I snap the catenary tie and crush the wax seal with my thumb, then shoulder the inner panel hard and dive into the crawlspace, dragging my maps tight to my chest. Over my shoulder, I bark at the Tidewarden, “Stay on the dogleg—don’t follow unless the whole span drops!”

*Agent reasoning: Catwalk is failing; fastest safe path is the crawlspace. The wax seal/wire is a delay—I'll break it and commit, no negotiation.*

### Turn 45 [GAME]

The catenary tie doesn’t “snap” so much as *fight*—it’s fresh, braided tight. Your burned fingers slip on the plastic jacket once, then you get leverage and tear it apart with a sharp *crack* that echoes in the void.

You grind your thumb into the wax seal. It breaks in gritty chunks, the stamped sigil splitting cleanly down the middle.

The moment the seal breaks, the green LED on the relay cradle flickers—steady to blinking—like it just acknowledged a state change.

“Fine—your void it is. If you fry me, I haunt your substation.”

From the speaker: a quiet exhale, then, “Don’t be dramatic. Go.”

You shoulder the inner panel. It gives way with a metallic bark and a burst of dry dust. You dive into the crawlspace, maps pressed to your chest. The edges scrape concrete; the space is tight enough that your packless shoulders still wedge. Your lamp beam stutters as it bumps the wall, then steadies, painting the crawlspace in a harsh cone.

Behind you, the catwalk span finally lets go—*not* the whole thing, but a section. A row of bolts shears and the grating drops with a shriek, slamming into the water and throwing up a cold spray that hits your boots and calves as you pull in. The sound is immediate: water slapping through the new hole, metal chattering against metal.

The Tidewarden, on the dogleg, does exactly what you told him—he doesn’t follow. He backs farther onto the platform, raises his lamp, and shouts over the noise, “Kestrel! I’m holding here!”

Something pale surges beneath the fallen grating and *rakes* at it from below. The metal flexes and clatters like teeth.

Inside the crawlspace, the air is dry but sharp with ozone. A thin cable runs along the right wall into the kink ahead. As you wriggle forward, your lamp catches fresh chalk hash-marks on the concrete—recent, neat, technician-straight.

From the speaker behind you, now muffled by the panel and distance: “Don’t turn around. Keep moving. There’s a drop in three meters—feet first. If you go headfirst, you’ll break your neck.”

No shocks hit you. But the blinking LED and that relay clack you heard earlier make it clear: someone just got notified you broke their seal.

*Triggered: guard_Crouch_0_8f1d4d, watcher_Crouch_0_b73e4b*

### Turn 46 [PLAYER]

I grit my teeth and shove forward along the right-wall cable, counting off the three meters under my breath. “Tidewarden—hold position and stay loud. If you go quiet, I’m assuming you’re dead.”  
At the drop, I swing my legs around, go feet-first, and ease down fast—lamp angled to catch the landing and any side access before I commit my weight.

*Agent reasoning: The catwalk is failing and the pale thing is active; the fastest safe path is deeper into the crawlspace. I’ll take the voice’s warning but stay wary, and I need to keep the Tidewarden from doing something dumb.*

### Turn 47 [GAME]

You follow the right-wall cable on elbows and knees, concrete biting through your trousers. At “three,” the crawlspace kinks down exactly as warned.

“Tidewarden—hold position and stay loud. If you go quiet, I’m assuming you’re dead.”

From behind, his voice carries through the panel and the dropped grating noise: “Still here! Still loud! You hear me, Kestrel?” He bangs something metal-on-metal twice—deliberate, a signal you can track through the structure.

You pivot in the tight space, swing your legs around, and feed them into the drop feet-first. Your lamp is angled down; the beam finds the landing before your soles do.

It’s a vertical service shaft, about two meters down. Dry. The floor is a grated platform over a deeper void, with a narrow ledge of poured concrete on the left wall—enough to stand on if you keep your weight close. The cable you’ve been following continues down through a conduit throat and disappears below the grating.

You ease down fast. Your boots touch the grating and it flexes—old steel, but not failing. When you shift your weight onto it, it holds.

Your lamp catches two important details immediately:

1) **Side access**: on the left wall, shoulder height, there’s a rectangular hatch with a recessed handle. It’s been opened recently—scrape marks around the handle, and the hinge pins are shiny.

2) **A threat**: on the far side of the shaft, opposite the hatch, there’s a small motion sensor puck and a pinhole camera set into a newer plate. A red indicator blinks once as your light sweeps it, then goes steady.

The calm voice comes again, now clearer, as if the speaker is in this shaft too: “Good. Stay off the center of the grate. Third bar from the left is cracked.”

As if to underline it, something below the grating **hits the underside**—not the pale thing from the water (this is dry), but a heavy, rhythmic *thunk* from deeper in the shaft. Dust puffs up through the grate. The impact is patient, repeated, like someone testing the same spot.

From behind you—muffled and more distant now—the Tidewarden is still making noise, but his banging has changed pace: faster, panicked. “Kestrel—IT’S CLIMBING—” His words cut off into a wet scramble and a sharp metallic crash.

Then he’s loud again, forced loud: “Still here! Still loud!” It sounds like he’s lying to keep you moving.

*Triggered: guard_Crouch_0_8f1d4d, watcher_Crouch_0_b73e4b*

### Turn 48 [PLAYER]

I flatten onto the left concrete ledge, keeping my weight off the center bars, and slide to the hatch. “Tidewarden, two bangs if you’re upright—three if you’re bleeding,” I shout, then yank the recessed handle and slip through fast, angling my lamp down to avoid lighting the camera.

*Agent reasoning: Tidewarden’s in trouble and the shaft has surveillance; fastest progress is through the side hatch while staying off the cracked grate and avoiding the camera’s view.*

### Turn 49 [GAME]

You plaster yourself to the left ledge and crab along it. The concrete is slick with old mineral bloom but solid; your boots find narrow purchase. The grate booms again under the next *thunk* from below, but you’re not on it—only your lamp beam trembles.

“Tidewarden, two bangs if you’re upright—three if you’re bleeding!”

There’s a pause, then **three** hard, uneven bangs answer back through the structure—one of them muffled, like his arm slipped. He shouts, voice ragged: “Bleeding. Still up. Don’t—don’t come back.”

You hook fingers into the recessed handle. It’s stiff—vacuum-tight—then gives with a wet pop as the seal breaks. You pull the hatch outward just enough to get a shoulder through.

Angling your lamp down helps, but the camera isn’t fooled by brightness alone. As you cross the threshold, the red indicator on the newer plate flips from steady to a rapid blink. Somewhere close, a relay clicks twice—confirmation, like a sent message.

You slip through fast.

On the other side is a narrow maintenance corridor, dry and warmer by a degree. The walls are old tile over concrete, but the cable runs are new: bundled, zip-tied, tagged with printed labels. Your lamp aimed low catches **bootscuffs and drag marks** leading away to the right, and a fresh smear of grease at knee height where someone crawled recently.

The hatch starts to swing shut behind you on a spring hinge. You can stop it, but if you let it close it will latch automatically.

From the speaker—now definitely in this corridor, not the shaft—the calm voice says, quieter: “Good. Keep the light down. They’ll have your faceprint in ten seconds.”

Behind the hatch, the rhythmic *thunk* below the grate changes—faster now, closer together—like whatever is down there has noticed movement above and is trying to time the structure.

And from the far right of your new corridor, beyond your lamp’s pool, something answers the relay clicks: a soft, human cough—then the scrape of a shoe adjusting stance, someone trying not to be heard but failing.

### Turn 50 [PLAYER]

I let the hatch swing shut and latch, then drop low against the left wall by the hinge, lamp hooded to a slit. “You—on the speaker. Give me the fastest path to an exit that doesn’t go past the cough.”

*Agent reasoning: Hatch latching buys time and blocks whatever’s thumping below; the watcher right is immediate threat, so I’ll close the hatch and move to cover while forcing the voice to give me a direct route past the human.*

### Turn 51 [GAME]

The hatch swings shut with a soft *clack* as the latch catches. The corridor noise changes immediately—more muffled, the deeper *thunk* from the shaft now a felt vibration through the wall instead of a boom.

You drop low by the hinge, left shoulder into tile, lamp reduced to a thin slit aimed at the floor. From here you can see under the corridor’s right-side shadow: the base of conduit racks, a thin line of damp dust, and the drag marks curving right.

The speaker answers without delay, voice close enough you feel it in the wall: “Fastest exit that avoids the right bend is behind you—service return. But it’s not an exit. It’s a loop to the valve gallery.”

You hear a quick *tap-tap* from somewhere ahead—like a knuckle on tile—then a whisper, not from the speaker, from the darkness to the right: “Mara?”

The cough wasn’t accidental. Whoever’s there knows your name.

The speaker continues, lower: “There’s a left crawl thirty paces ahead, opposite the right bend. You can reach it without showing your face if you stay low and keep the light down. It drops into a cable trench that runs to the old tramline junction. That junction is watched.”

A new sound joins in: a faint electronic chirp, once, from the camera plate back in the shaft—audible even through the hatch. Then another, as if it’s handshaking with something. You get the sense your presence just propagated outward.

From the right-hand darkness, the unseen person shifts again—shoe rubber squeaks on tile. A small beam of light, tighter than yours, flicks on for half a second and cuts off, like they’re signaling or checking distance without committing.

They whisper again, closer than before: “Don’t run. Just talk.”

The threat is clear now: one human ahead on the right with at least a small light, and your position has likely been logged by the corridor’s newer surveillance. The left crawl the speaker mentioned exists, but reaching it means moving into the open stretch where the watcher can close distance or call others.

*Triggered: guard_Crouch_0_8f1d4d, watcher_Crouch_0_b73e4b*

### Turn 52 [PLAYER]

Keeping low, I slide forward along the left wall toward the left crawl, lamp still hooded. “Not running—routing,” I call back flatly. “Say your name and what you want, or stay in the dark.”

*Agent reasoning: The watcher knows my name and wants me to “talk”—stall tactic or ambush. Fastest safe move is the left crawl; I’ll move low, keep them unsure, and avoid giving my face to cameras or their light.*

### Turn 53 [GAME]

You slide forward, shoulder and hip scraping tile, keeping your silhouette low. The hooded slit of light tracks the base of the wall: dust, cable ties, a junction box with a new printed label—**“RACK 3 / FEED A”**—and then, ahead, the corridor opens into the decision point the speaker mentioned.

On your left: a **low rectangular crawl** cut into the wall, its edge ringed with fresh sealant like someone’s been in and out. The opening is just big enough for a body and a pack—if you had one. A faint draft spills out, warmer and drier than the corridor air.

On your right: the corridor bends away into darker space.

“Not running—routing,” you call, voice flat. “Say your name and what you want, or stay in the dark.”

The person on the right answers immediately, and it’s a woman’s voice—thin, controlled, trying to sound casual and failing at it. “Sable. Choir.” A pause. “I want the ceramic. And I want you alive.”

As she says it, she does something practical: a small object skitters across the tile from the right bend into the open stretch—**a palm-sized puck** that lands near the centerline and emits a soft, rising whine. Your lamp slit catches it just enough to see a blinking LED.

A heartbeat later, your eyes sting and your throat tightens—**irritant**, fine and dry, not smoke. It’s meant to flush you out of the low line and make you cough loud enough to pinpoint.

Sable stays behind the corner; you don’t see her, but you hear her shift and the quiet click of something being readied—metal on plastic, like a compact launcher or a tool being unfolded.

The speaker in the wall cuts in, sharp for the first time: “IN. NOW.”

Behind you, through tile and latch, the shaft transmits a faster sequence of impacts—*thunk-thunk-thunk*—as if whatever’s below has found a rhythm and is climbing or striking supports in a pattern. The corridor vibrates lightly with each hit.

You are at the left crawl entrance, low and close. The irritant is already in the air and thickening around the floor level where you’re breathing. Sable is armed around the right bend, and she’s trying to force you to either cough, stand, or retreat.

### Turn 54 [PLAYER]

I suck a shallow breath through my sleeve, clamp my mouth shut, and snake into the left crawl fast—kicking the irritant puck back toward the right bend as I go. “Keep wanting me alive, Sable—don’t follow blind.”

*Agent reasoning: Irritant will pin me and Sable has the angle; fastest is commit to the left crawl immediately, keep low, and avoid coughing. Seal her line of sight and force a chase on my terms.*

### Turn 55 [GAME]

You pull your sleeve over nose and mouth, take one tight sip of air, and commit. Your shoulders wedge the crawl’s lip; fresh sealant smears your shirt as you wriggle in.

Your heel catches the puck on the way—solid contact. It skates back across the tile, spinning, LED strobing as it bounces once and slides toward the right bend.

It works: the puck disappears around the corner and the whine spikes, now clearly coming from Sable’s side. A half-second later she coughs—one sharp, involuntary bark—and you hear her stumble back a step.

But the irritant you already stirred up doesn’t vanish. The crawl is narrower than the corridor, and the air in here is **stale**. Your sleeve helps, but your eyes water hard and your chest wants to seize into a cough you’re fighting by will alone.

Behind you, Sable snaps, voice harsher now: “—Fine. Fine! Don’t—” Another cough, then a clipped command to someone else you can’t see: “Mask up!”

So she’s not alone, or she’s calling backup.

Then the sound you were warned about: a compact *thup*—not a gunshot, more like a spring-propelled tool. Something strikes the crawl entrance with a metallic *clink* and scrapes, as if she’s fired or tossed a **hooked probe** to snag cables or drag you back.

It doesn’t catch you—your legs are already past the lip—but it **bites into the crawl edge** and holds. The line attached to it goes taut.

Sable, still around the bend, calls after you between breaths: “Mara! I can pull you out of there, or I can pull the whole mouth down. Your choice.”

Ahead, the crawl drops a few inches into a cable trench—dark, tight, and running forward. Your lamp slit shows bundled wire and a shallow channel you can belly-slide along. You can keep moving deeper, but there’s now a tether anchored at the entrance that can be used to haul, block, or collapse the opening if she’s telling the truth.

The banging from the shaft continues behind the latched hatch—fast and regular—close enough that the tile under your ribs trembles.

*Triggered: guard_Crouch_0_8f1d4d, watcher_Crouch_0_b73e4b*

### Turn 56 [PLAYER]

I wrench my leg back and stomp the line into the cable bundle, twisting to snag it, then scrape it hard against the crawl lip to fray or jam the hook. “Pull it and you’ll bring the ceiling on your own head,” I rasp, and then I belly-slide deeper down the trench, lamp slit kept low and forward.

*Agent reasoning: Speed says don’t negotiate—break the tether and keep moving before backup arrives; use environment (cables/edge) to foul the line.*

### Turn 57 [GAME]

Your boot finds the line where it crosses the crawl mouth. You stomp it down into the cable bundle and twist—hard. The sheath bites into old insulation; copper strands underneath the bundle *ping* as they shift. Then you drag the line against the crawl lip where the sealant is still tacky.

It doesn’t cleanly fray, but it **jams**. The hook at the entrance scrapes and chatters as you torque the line sideways; you hear the metal point grind against the concrete edge.

Sable tests it with a sharp tug.

The line goes taut, then **sticks**. Instead of you sliding back, the tension transfers to the crawl mouth: you hear a brittle *crack* from the lip—old concrete spalling—followed by a sprinkle of grit and a couple of pebble-sized chunks bouncing into the trench beside your ribs.

Your threat lands. Sable stops pulling.

“—Shit,” she hisses, voice closer now, like she’s crouched at the bend listening. “Don’t move. Don’t move—”

A second voice answers her, muffled like it’s behind a respirator: “You want me to cut it?”

Sable: “No. If we cut it, she keeps the hook.”

Then: the distinct sound of a **blade on line** anyway—someone’s sawing carefully, not to free you, but to free *their* tool without yanking the mouth down. The line vibrates against the cable bundle under your boot.

You belly-slide deeper. The trench narrows and angles slightly downward. Your lamp slit catches a run of cable tags—old municipal—then a newer painted mark: that same **stenciled symbol** you saw on the hatch, repeated small on the trench wall as if guiding someone who knows it.

Behind you, the sawing continues for two seconds… then stops. A soft *snap* follows—not a clean cut. The line breaks under tension.

The hook stays **in the crawl lip**. The loose end of line whips back toward them out in the corridor.

Sable’s voice follows you, sharper and no longer pretending calm: “She’s in the trench! She’s heading tramline-side—call it in!”

You gain distance, but you’ve left a metal hook embedded at the mouth like a marker, and you’ve just confirmed your route to at least two Choir operatives. The irritant is weaker down here, but your eyes still burn and your chest is tight; any hard exertion risks a cough that carries in the confined trench.

### Turn 58 [PLAYER]

I kill the lamp for three seconds, count the seconds between their voices, then relight to a slit and take the first side splice/handhole I can find, even if it’s tight. As I pass, I yank a loose cable loop and kick grit into the trench behind me to foul crawling and hide my track, then keep sliding fast and silent.

*Agent reasoning: They’re calling in my route; speed matters. I need to break line-of-pursuit and avoid coughing—ditch the marked path by taking the first junction/maintenance splice and create a simple obstruction behind me.*

### Turn 59 [GAME]

### Turn 60 [PLAYER]

I keep the lamp to a slit and push deeper until I hit a marked handhole or splice box, then peel into it and pull the cover back into place behind me. I listen for pursuit—how many sets of scrapes, how fast—then move toward the tramline junction only if it stays quiet.

*Agent reasoning: Blank prompt means no new scene; I’ll force forward progress—get out of the trench to a junction and away from the Choir’s line-of-travel.*

### Turn 61 [GAME]

You keep the lamp down to a thin slit and shove forward on forearms and hips, cable insulation slick under your sleeves. The trench runs another ten meters before the wall widens into a rectangular recess: a handhole with a cast cover half-buried in silt. On its rim, under grime, the same stenciled mark repeats—fresh enough to still look black, not algae-bloomed.

You hook your fingers under the cover edge and lever. It gives with a wet pop. The opening is barely shoulder-wide, but it’s there. You peel in sideways, ribs scraping concrete, and pull the cover back into place from inside until it settles with a dull *thunk*. From the trench side it looks closed again—just another dirty lid.

You go still and listen.

At first: nothing but your own breathing and the faint far-off banging through structure.

Then, from back the way you came: **two** distinct sets of contact sounds—one heavier, one lighter—scraping and bumping along the trench. They’re not belly-sliding as cleanly as you did; you hear cable ties snap and grit dragged, and once, a muffled curse.

Sable’s voice carries down the trench, closer now, controlled again: “Easy. Don’t pull on anything—there’s a drop somewhere.”

The second voice, still respirator-muffled: “Hook’s gone. Line’s gone. She’s ahead.”

They stop near where your handhole is—close enough that the cover above you ticks as grit shifts under someone’s weight. A flashlight beam knifes past the lid’s seam in a thin, accidental line, then moves on. The heavier one taps the trench wall with something metal—*tink… tink…*—testing for hollows.

Sable, right over you or just past: “She knows these. Check lids.”

A hand scrapes across the cover’s edge. The lid shifts a hair—enough to sprinkle dust into your hair—but it doesn’t lift. After a second, the hand moves away.

They continue forward, past you, their scrapes receding toward tramline-side.

You wait them out. When their sounds thin and the trench goes quiet again, you ease the cover up a finger-width and look through the seam: empty trench, their light now a distant smear.

Moving toward the tramline junction is possible now, but you’ve learned two things: they’re willing to crawl the trench after you, and they’re actively checking for hides—if they loop back, this handhole won’t stay safe twice.

### Turn 62 [PLAYER]

I ease the cover up just enough to slip out, then seal it back down without a clack. Lamp stays slit-tight as I belly-slide the way they came—fast, aiming to pop out at the crawl mouth/corridor behind them and break for the tramline junction before they double back.

*Agent reasoning: They passed me and will check back; best move is to slip behind them and take the junction before they realize. Minimal noise, quick transition back into the trench and reverse direction.*

### Turn 63 [GAME]

You ease the cover up a finger-width, then two, and slide out like you’re being born back into the trench. You settle the lid down from the outside with your palm flat, letting it sink into silt instead of clacking on concrete. It lands with a soft, gritty *shff*—quiet enough.

Lamp stays a slit. You reverse direction and drive yourself forward, fast. Your earlier grit-kick and cable yank did what you wanted: the trench behind you is rougher now, and you can feel it—snag points, loose loops, places to catch a knee. You power through them anyway.

Halfway back, you hear it: a new sound layered over the distant banging—water moving where it shouldn’t. Not a wave, not drip. A thin, steady *glug-glug* like a siphon catching.

Then the trench floor gives a little under your weight—silt liquefying. Your forearm plunges to the elbow into cold slurry and you have to wrench it free. The lamp slit wobbles; your beam catches a hairline seam in the trench wall where the newer sealant is peeling.

You keep going.

At the crawl mouth, the embedded hook is still there, canted at an angle like a thorn. You ease past it and push your head out into the corridor—

—and immediately see light on the wet concrete: a flashlight beam sweeping back toward you. They’ve turned around sooner than you counted on.

Sable is ten meters down-corridor, crouched, looking into the trench line you’re emerging from. The respirator-muffled one stands behind her with a short pry bar in hand. They’re not running; they’re hunting.

Sable’s eyes catch the glint off your lamp slit for a fraction of a second.

“There,” she says, flat and certain.

The respirator voice barks, “Block her—”

Sable surges toward you, not to tackle, but to **slam the crawl mouth** with her boot and body weight. The corridor is narrow; if she gets her foot on the lip, you’re pinned half-in, half-out.

At the same moment, the *glug* behind you becomes a sudden *rush*—the trench you just belly-slid through starts taking water, fast, as if a valve or pocket gave way. Cold water pushes at your legs from inside the crawl, trying to shove you out into the corridor… or trap you if the mouth gets blocked.

You have a heartbeat of advantage: you’re already at the lip, shoulders out. But Sable is closing, and the trench is actively flooding behind you.

*Triggered: guard_Crouch_0_8f1d4d, watcher_Crouch_0_b73e4b*

### Turn 64 [PLAYER]

I lunge fully out, twisting hard to clear my hips, and as Sable closes I kick the embedded hook/lip sideways at ankle height to catch her step. “Bad timing—your trench is flooding,” I rasp, then break into a dead sprint toward the tramline junction, lamp still a slit and kept low.

*Agent reasoning: I can’t get pinned in the mouth with water rising; fastest is commit out, use the hook/lip as a trip point, then sprint for the tramline junction before they can reset.*

### Turn 65 [GAME]

You wrench your hips free and spill onto the corridor floor just as the trench behind you surges—cold water slapping your boots from the crawl mouth.

Sable commits to the block anyway. You snap your foot sideways at ankle height, catching the embedded hook/lip and levering it out just enough that it bites where her step wants to land.

Her boot comes down—then skates as the hook shifts. Her ankle rolls. She goes down hard on one knee with a sharp, involuntary grunt, palms slapping the wet concrete.

“Bad timing—your trench is flooding,” you rasp as you’re already turning.

The respirator-muffled one reacts instantly: he doesn’t stop to help her. He lunges past, pry bar up like a baton, trying to cut the corridor angle and tag you as you accelerate. The bar whistles and *clangs* off the wall a handspan from your shoulder as you duck your lamp and drive forward.

Behind you, Sable snarls through pain, “Don’t—let—her—” then she sucks a breath and shouts, louder, “Mark her route! Don’t chase blind!”

The flooding trench makes its own announcement: a rising, hollow roar as water fills the cable run and burps air back out of the crawl mouth. It’s loud enough to smear your footfalls for a moment—good cover—but it also means that crawl is about to become a sluice, and anything connected to it may start taking water.

You sprint toward the tramline junction. The corridor bends past a set of blistered signage plates. Your slit beam catches fresh wet scuffs—boot traffic recent—leading the same way. Not just theirs.

At the bend, the air changes: cooler, more open. The tramline junction is close.

Behind you, the respirator runner is still coming, lighter on his feet than you expected. You hear his breath hiss and the slap of rubber soles gaining, and Sable—still back at the crawl mouth—yells something you can’t fully make out over the water, but you catch the last word: “—junction!”

They’re not only chasing. They’re calling ahead.

*Triggered: guard_Crouch_0_8f1d4d, watcher_Crouch_0_b73e4b*

### Turn 66 [PLAYER]

I kill the lamp for two strides, then cut hard to the wall and feel for any service ladder/utility alcove before the junction mouth; if I find one, I drop into it to bypass the open junction. If not, I grab whatever loose signage/pipe bracket I can and rip it down behind me as I run to make the corridor a mess, then hiss, “Wrong way,” and peel into the first side access marked for maintenance instead of the main tramline.

*Agent reasoning: They’re calling ahead, so the junction is about to get boxed. Fastest play is to avoid the main opening, use infrastructure to change levels, and buy seconds by creating noise/obstacles behind me.*

### Turn 67 [GAME]

You kill the lamp and take two blind strides. Your shoulder kisses the wall; your fingers skate over blistered paint and wet concrete until they find a vertical seam—an inset frame. You keep moving by touch, feeling for ladder rungs or a latch.

Your hand hits cold metal: a recessed pull ring. You yank.

Nothing—then it gives a centimeter with a gritty squeal you can’t fully smother. The panel is heavier than it should be, and it’s stuck on swollen guides. You brace and haul again. It opens enough to slip your head and one shoulder into a narrow utility alcove: a service drop with a ladder down into black.

You don’t climb so much as fall onto the first rungs and slide down fast, palms burning. Above, you drag the panel toward closed; it doesn’t seat flush, but it narrows to a finger gap. From the corridor, it’ll look like a misaligned access, not an open hole.

You hear the respirator runner hit the bend and overshoot by momentum—boot slaps, a sharp intake. His light sweeps, catches the skewed edge of the access panel for a blink, then swings away.

He hisses, close, “Kestrel! Junction’s ahead—don’t—”

Sable’s voice, farther back, hard: “She’s not going open. Check the wall. Check the wall!”

The runner doubles back two steps. His beam crawls along the concrete and lands on the panel gap. He steps in, pry bar tapping once—*tink*—right above your head through the metal.

You freeze on the ladder, one rung down from the alcove floor, the shaft air damp and cold. Below you, water is moving—quiet but present—lapping against something metal, like a flooded landing. The same siphon-glug you heard in the trench is down here too, faint but steady, as if this drop ties into the run that just started filling.

Above, the runner wedges the pry bar into the panel seam. Metal groans. The gap widens a fraction.

Sable arrives at the bend; you hear her limp in the cadence. “Open it,” she says. “If she went down, she’s boxed. These drops dead-end or flood.”

The pry bar bites again. The panel starts to peel open.

You are in the service drop, on a ladder, with someone about to look straight down—and water rising somewhere underneath.

*Triggered: guard_Crouch_0_8f1d4d, watcher_Crouch_0_b73e4b*

### Turn 68 [PLAYER]

I kill the lamp and slide down the ladder hard, skipping rungs until I hit the flooded landing with a splash, then move off to the side and yank something metal loose to clatter deeper in the dark. “Yeah—dead end,” I call up, breath tight, then go silent and feel for a low hatch or conduit run out of the landing.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to spot me; fastest is to break line-of-sight and force a choice—either they follow into rising water or lose me. I’ll drop fast, kill the lamp, and make noise deeper to bait them away from the shaft lip.*

### Turn 69 [GAME]

You slide fast—palms stuttering on wet rungs—then drop the last meter and hit the landing with a loud splash. Water comes up to mid-shin, colder than the trench, and it smells like battery acid and rust.

You sidestep into the darkest corner you can find, shoulder to slick brick, and rip at the nearest loose thing: a corroded conduit strap half-hanging from the wall. It tears free with a gritty snap. You fling it out into the dark; it clatters across metal grating and bounces—*clang… clang… clang*—then settles with a final hollow *donk* deeper in the shaft.

“Yeah—dead end,” you call up, breath tight.

For half a second there’s nothing—then the pry bar above stops working the panel.

Sable’s voice carries down, closer now, sharp with certainty: “She’s lying.”

The respirator runner answers, “I heard her—she’s down there.”

“Then don’t look down like an idiot,” Sable snaps. “Drop a light. If she runs, she runs into water.”

A moment later something small scrapes over the lip above, and a light source drops: not a flashlight—too valuable—but a chemical glowstick. It bounces off a rung, hits the water with a *plop*, and floats, casting a sick green wash across the landing.

The glow outlines you didn’t see in the dark: the landing is a grated platform bolted to the wall, with an open rectangular sump cut into it on the far side. Water is actively draining into that sump in a steady whirl, the *glug* you heard now loud and constant. Whatever started siphoning is pulling from here too.

In the green light you feel along the wall: you find a low, square hatch at knee height, its edges sealed long ago—until recently. Fresh gray sealant has been cut and peeled back in a rough crescent, leaving a gap you can get fingers into. The hatch is warm compared to the water, like there’s air moving behind it.

Above you, boots scrape; someone starts down the ladder. The rungs creak in a steady rhythm—controlled descent, one hand free.

Sable stays up top, voice angled down: “Don’t go far. She wants you close.”

The immediate threats are clear: one of them is descending into the shaft toward the landing, and the siphon is pulling water down through the sump hard enough that footing on the grating is getting slicker by the second.

*Triggered: guard_Crouch_0_8f1d4d, watcher_Crouch_0_b73e4b, watcher_Bars_0_922077*

### Turn 70 [PLAYER]

I wrench the low hatch open and shove through immediately, keeping low and using the air flow as my guide; once I’m in, I pull it mostly shut to kill the green glow spill. If the ladder climber hits the landing, I kick water toward the sump to mask my sound, then move fast along the conduit run without the lamp.

*Agent reasoning: Fast exit beats hiding; the warm, recently-cut hatch is the only likely route before the climber reaches the landing, and the sump makes this spot a trap.*

### Turn 71 [GAME]

You get your fingers into the cut sealant and heave. The hatch fights—swollen gasket, metal-on-metal—then pops free with a sharp *crack* that echoes off the shaft walls. You shove through immediately, chest and shoulder scraping the frame, and drop into a low service run.

The air is moving in here, steady and warmer, carrying a dry-dust smell and the faint tang of ozone. You stay crouched and pull the hatch mostly shut behind you. The green glow from the shaft collapses to a thin line at the seam, then almost nothing.

Behind the hatch, the ladder climber reaches the landing. You hear his boots splash, then the grate creak as he shifts weight. You sweep your foot through the water on your side of the hatch opening—one hard kick—sending a sheet toward the sump. It answers with a louder *glug* and a brief increase in draining noise, enough to smear the small sounds you make as you move.

The climber mutters, close and muffled through rubber and mask, “Landing. Glow’s here.” His pry bar taps the grate once. “No visual.”

Sable’s voice drops down from above, calmer now: “Check the walls. Feel for warm air. She’ll take a cut.”

The conduit run you’re in is just tall enough to crouch-walk. Bundles of cable are clipped along the right side like ribs; your shoulder brushes them and they tremble faintly. You move fast without the lamp, guided by the airflow and the texture changes under your boots—smooth concrete to rougher aggregate, then a short section of metal plate.

Twenty meters in, the corridor doglegs left. As you round it, the airflow strengthens—and with it comes a new sound: that rhythmic banging, closer than it’s ever been, coming from somewhere ahead and slightly below, like a hammer on a pipe in a flooded void. *Thunk… pause… thunk… pause…*

Behind you, metal groans. The hatch—your hatch—scrapes. The climber has found it and is working it from the other side.

He calls out, low but urgent, “Found a cut hatch. Warm draft.”

Sable answers immediately, “Hold. I’m coming down. Don’t follow her into a box alone.”

The threat is now twofold: the hatch behind you is being opened (they’re about to enter), and ahead in the dark the banging source is close and aligned with your path.

### Turn 72 [PLAYER]

I keep moving, low and fast toward the banging, feeling for a junction box, valve wheel, or any loose cable clamp I can rip free; if I find one, I drag it along the wall to scrape and then toss it back down the corridor to fake my direction. When the banging’s within arm’s reach, I hiss, “You alive?” into the dark without stopping, then angle toward any downward access or side cut the airflow favors.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to breach the hatch; I need distance fast. The banging could be a person or a hazard, but it’s also a landmark—push past it and find an exit or a choke point.*

### Turn 73 [GAME]

You crouch-run the conduit, one hand on the cable ribs, the other probing the wall for anything you can tear free. Your fingers find a junction box—old steel, hinged—half its screws missing. You wrench; it doesn’t come off clean, but the lid tears free with a shriek of metal and a snap of brittle paint.

You drag that lid along the wall as you move—deliberate scrape, long and ugly—then whip it back down the corridor behind you. It skitters on the metal plate section, bouncing hard at the dogleg: *CLANG—clatter—clatter—clatter* fading toward the hatch.

Immediately: voices behind you shift. The climber (now inside the run) calls, “She’s moving—left! Heard it—” His boots slap into a run, chasing the thrown noise.

Sable’s answer is tight and corrective, closer than before: “That’s a throw. Slow down. Read the air—”

You keep going.

The banging is close enough to feel through your knees as vibration in the floor plate: *thunk… thunk…* Regular, patient. You reach a section where the conduit widens into a small service bay with a waist-high rail and a square opening in the floor—an access down. The air is definitely favoring that opening: warmer draft rising, carrying a sharper ozone bite and a whiff of hot insulation.

At the edge of the opening, the source of the banging reveals itself in the faintest ambient bleed from behind you: a vertical pipe disappears into the hole, and something below is striking it with steady force—metal on metal, not random debris. Each hit rings up the pipe like a tuning fork.

You don’t stop. You lean into the dark and hiss, “You alive?”

The banging stops mid-cycle.

A voice answers from below, close enough to be directly under the opening, distorted as if through a mask or a mouthful of water: “Isolator.”

Not a question. A demand.

Then, very softly, another sound: fingers—or something like fingers—scraping the inside of the pipe as if climbing by feel.

From behind you, pursuit noise returns—boots, a hard breath—faster now: the runner has realized the throw too late and is correcting back toward you.

You angle toward the down access with the rising warm air. The opening is just big enough to drop through, but there’s no ladder visible—only the pipe, a slick rim, and darkness that smells like live electrical gear somewhere below.

Threats are now explicit and immediate:
- The runner is closing from behind inside the conduit run.
- Something below the access knows about the isolator and is moving upward toward the opening.

*Triggered: guard_Crouch_0_8f1d4d, watcher_Crouch_0_b73e4b, watcher_Bars_0_922077*

### Turn 74 [PLAYER]

I snap, “Which isolator—color or label?” while I hook my boot on the rail, grab the pipe with both hands, and drop through the opening fast, sliding down the pipe to control the fall; as I go, I kick the rail hard to clang and make it sound like I slipped.

*Agent reasoning: Runner’s closing; dropping is fastest. “Isolator” likely means cut power—might buy safety and bargaining leverage with whatever’s below. I’ll force the pursuer to hesitate by making the drop look lethal and commit to the down route.*

### Turn 75 [GAME]

“Which isolator—color or label?” you snap into the hole as you commit.

Your boot hooks the rail; both hands clamp the pipe. You drop through and let your weight slide, palms burning as the pipe’s cold slime and rust fight your grip. On the way down you kick the rail hard—*KLANG*—a clean, panicked-sounding hit that rings up into the conduit bay.

Above, the runner skids in and swears. “She—she slipped—!” His boots slap the grate; he leans over the opening, glow leaking down in a thin wedge.

The voice below answers immediately, closer now, calm in a way that doesn’t match the banging: “Ceramic. Upland stamp. Don’t play dumb.”

They know exactly what you took.

Your slide buys you distance, but not safety. Ten feet down the pipe, something *hits you*—a hand or tool hooking your ankle. You jerk, lose friction, and drop the last stretch uncontrolled. You slam into shallow water with your side and forearm, hard enough to knock air out of you. The pipe hums above like a struck bell.

You’re in a lower chamber: a dry-ish concrete shelf at the edge, with ankle-deep water beyond and a narrow catwalk running left. The air is warmer here, and there’s a faint blue-white flicker deeper in—arcing or a relay indicator—lighting wet surfaces in pulses.

Right in front of you, half-crouched in the water, is a figure in a patched suit with a scavenged face shield. One gloved hand holds a short striking tool—what they were using to bang the pipe—now lowered. The other hand is extended toward you, palm up.

“Give it,” they say, not raising their voice. “And I’ll tell you which way stays dry.”

Above, the runner’s voice echoes down the pipe: “Mara! Answer me!” Metal scrapes—he’s starting down after you, using the pipe or whatever purchase he can find.

You have two immediate threats in the same space: the unknown below who knows about the upland isolator and is within arm’s reach, and the Tidewarden runner descending toward your position through the pipe you just used.

*Triggered: guard_Crouch_0_8f1d4d, watcher_Crouch_0_b73e4b, watcher_Bars_0_922077*

### Turn 76 [PLAYER]

I slap my wet map case once like I’m checking it, keep the isolator hidden, and bark, “Dry route. Now. I’ll pay when I see it.” Then I grab their extended wrist, shove it down and sideways to off-balance them, and bolt left along the catwalk—low, fast—calling up the pipe, “Keep coming and you’ll eat water, idiot.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m boxed between the runner above and this scav below; fastest exit is to buy two seconds, trade partial truth, then move toward the catwalk before the runner drops in.*

### Turn 77 [GAME]

You slap your map case—hard, loud—like you’re checking it’s still there. The shielded figure’s head tilts toward it instantly. Their gloved hand tightens, not on your arm but on the idea of what you’re carrying.

“Dry route. Now. I’ll pay when I see it,” you bark.

Their palm stays up. “Payment first.”

You take the wrist instead.

Your grip lands on slick glove and taped seam; you shove down and sideways. It works—partially. They stumble a half-step, boot skidding in the ankle-deep water, but they don’t go down. The striking tool flashes up, not swung full-force—just a short, brutal jab aimed at your ribs as you pass.

It clips you on the side: a dull, compressing hit that steals a slice of breath and leaves a hot ache spreading under your arm.

You bolt left onto the catwalk, low and fast. The catwalk is narrow—rebar rail on one side, open water on the other—and it vibrates under your steps. Ahead, the blue-white flicker resolves into a relay cradle mounted on a concrete plinth: ceramic standoffs, fresh-looking cable ties, and a small indicator lamp blinking in a steady, unnatural rhythm.

Behind you, the shielded figure splashes up onto the catwalk after you, moving with practiced balance. “She’s got it!” they call—not to you. Up the pipe. “She’s running left!”

You shout up the pipe, “Keep coming and you’ll eat water, idiot.”

Above, the Tidewarden runner answers with a laugh that’s too thin. “I can swim.”

Then metal shrieks—he’s sliding faster than he should, using the pipe like a fireman’s pole. You hear the scrape and the accelerating rattle; he’s committing to the drop.

The immediate threats are now clear:
- The shielded figure is in pursuit on the catwalk, armed with the short striking tool and calling your direction.
- The Tidewarden runner is about to land in the lower chamber behind you, cutting off retreat and forcing a close chase along the catwalk toward the live relay gear.

No new items change hands; the isolator remains hidden.

### Turn 78 [PLAYER]

I skid in at the relay plinth, rip free a handful of the “fresh” cable ties/cables to make a nasty snag across the catwalk, then shoulder past the plinth and drop low on the far side to use it as cover. “Dry route, now—door, ladder, anything—talk!” I snap over my shoulder at the shielded figure while listening for where the runner lands.

### Turn 80 [PLAYER]

I yank loose a fistful of the fresh cable ties and any slack lead I can grab, string it waist-high across the catwalk as a quick snag, then drop low behind the relay plinth for cover. “Dry route—door, ladder, anything—talk,” I bark at the shielded figure, and I listen hard for the runner’s splash/impact to judge how close he is.

*Agent reasoning: Blank screen means the engine’s waiting; I’ll restate a fast, safe action—set a snag, take cover, force directions, track the runner’s landing.*

### Turn 81 [GAME]

You hit the relay plinth and grab at the “fresh” work first—white cable ties and a loop of slack lead dressed too neatly to be old salvage. The ties tear free with sharp snaps; the slack lead fights you, then gives with a gritty scrape where it was cinched to a bracket.

The moment you disturb it, the indicator lamp on the cradle stutters—blink, blink—then goes steady for a full second. A faint buzz rises in the metal under your hand like a throat clearing.

You string the lead and ties waist-high across the catwalk in a fast, ugly line—more snag than barrier—then drop low behind the concrete plinth. From there you can see the catwalk’s approach and the waterline, but your legs are tight to the edge; one bad shove and you’re in.

The shielded figure charges the last few steps and hits your snag. It catches them across the hips; they pitch forward, arms windmilling. They don’t go over— they slam a palm onto the rebar rail, tool clattering once against metal, and hang there for a heartbeat before they wrench free, ripping the line loose with them.

They crouch, breathing hard, then point the striking tool at the relay cradle like a threat. “You don’t touch that,” they hiss. “You don’t—”

You bark, “Dry route—door, ladder, anything—talk.”

They glance past you, up toward the pipe. Their voice drops, urgent now. “Left end. Service hatch. Yellow wheel. But it’s *keyed*—”

A splash answers from behind—heavy, wrong. Not a clean drop onto shelf: the Tidewarden runner hits the lower chamber water first, then scrapes onto concrete with a wet slap and a grunt. You hear him cough once, then boots on metal: he’s found the catwalk.

His light swings, painting the plinth’s edges and your cover in a bright, searching arc. “Mara!” he calls, closer than you want. “Don’t make me drag you out.”

The shielded figure’s head snaps toward that voice and they shift their weight, angling to rush you around the plinth—either to grab you or to get past you to the hatch they just named.

The threats are immediate and converging: the runner is on the catwalk within a few seconds’ sprint, and the shielded figure is regaining balance and moving again, now desperate and angry that you disturbed the relay.

### Turn 82 [PLAYER]

I pop up just enough to snag the shielded figure’s sleeve/strap and yank them toward the left end. “Keyed? Then you’re my key—move.” As the runner closes, I slap the relay plinth hard and shout, “One more step and I dump this relay into the drink—whole bay goes live,” then I shove the shielded figure ahead of me toward the service hatch with the yellow wheel.

*Agent reasoning: Two enemies converging; don’t get pinned. Use the keyed-hatch info, force the shielded figure to open it, and slow the runner with the live relay threat.*

### Turn 83 [GAME]

You surge up from cover and get a fistful of the shielded figure’s sleeve strap. It’s not cloth—rubberized webbing over a hard suit seam—and it yanks them off balance. They stumble toward the left end, boots ringing on the catwalk.

“Keyed? Then you’re my key—move.”

They snarl something you don’t catch and try to twist free, but you keep the strap and drive them forward with your shoulder.

You slap the relay plinth as you pass. The concrete thumps; the cradle’s indicator flashes fast-fast-fast, and the faint buzz you heard earlier sharpens into a thin whine that crawls up the catwalk rail. The air smells suddenly sharper—ozone and wet metal.

You shout at the runner, “One more step and I dump this relay into the drink—whole bay goes live!”

The Tidewarden runner slows, but not because he buys the bluff—because he sees the indicator pattern change and hears the whine. He plants his feet wide, light pinned on you and the cradle. “Don’t,” he says, voice gone flat. “That’s not a toy. You arc it, you cook us all.”

He raises one hand, palm out, the other still holding his lamp. He’s cautious now, but he’s still advancing in half-steps, trying to angle for a clean grab without putting himself between you and the water.

At the left end, the service hatch is exactly where the shielded figure said: a low steel door set into the wall with a chipped yellow wheel. Fresh sealant beads around the frame—new work on old concrete.

The shielded figure gets one gloved hand on the wheel and hesitates—then jerks their elbow back hard, trying to smash you in the faceplate area with the edge of their forearm to break your hold. If it lands clean, you’ll lose them right at the hatch.

Behind you, the runner starts moving again, faster now that you’re committed to the door. “Mara—stop! Let her open it and step away!”

The immediate threats are:
- Close-quarters strike from the shielded figure at the hatch.
- The runner closing from behind, ready to grab or tackle on the narrow catwalk.
- The relay cradle whining and flashing in an unstable pattern after you hit it—if it trips or arcs, this whole bay becomes a hazard.

### Turn 84 [PLAYER]

I duck into the elbow, take it on the shoulder, and ram my forearm across their chest to pin them to the hatch. “Spin it or I break your wrist on that wheel,” I hiss, then bark over my shoulder at the runner: “Back off—two steps—or we all fry.”

*Agent reasoning: Speedrun priority is the hatch—get through before the runner can tackle. I’ll eat a glancing hit if needed, pin the shielded figure to the wheel to force it open, and use the unstable relay as deterrent without actually dumping it.*

### Turn 85 [GAME]

You duck, but the elbow still clips you—hard—right on the top of the shoulder where your collar meets the strap line. Pain flashes down your arm and your hand goes numb for half a beat.

You don’t let go.

You drive your forearm across their chest and pin them to the hatch. Their visor bumps the steel with a hollow *gong*. They suck air and claw at your arm with one gloved hand while the other finds the yellow wheel by feel.

“Spin it or I break your wrist on that wheel,” you hiss.

They freeze—then, with a shaky breath, they start turning. The wheel fights like it’s been sealed and recently disturbed; it moves in short, grinding increments. Fresh sealant at the frame stretches and tears with wet little pops.

Behind you, your bark hits the runner. “Back off—two steps—or we all fry.”

The Tidewarden runner actually does it—one, two measured steps back—boots clanging on the catwalk. But he doesn’t lower the lamp. He angles it past you to the relay cradle, watching the flashing like it’s a fuse burning down. “I’m back,” he says, voice tight. “Keep your hands off the cradle.”

The cradle’s whine rises another notch anyway, not from him—its indicator is now cycling in a pattern, too regular to be random. Something is drawing or testing load. The catwalk rail under your pinned arm starts to faintly vibrate.

The wheel gives a final quarter-turn and *clunks*. The hatch seal breaks with a sigh of dry air—warm compared to the bay, smelling of dust and old insulation instead of algae rot. The door cracks open an inch.

The shielded figure uses that moment: they shove backward into you, trying to wedge you between their suit and the door edge, then they twist their wrist to slip your grip. You feel them reaching inside the crack with their free hand for something—latch, chain, or a secondary lock.

At the same time, the runner shifts his weight forward again, reading your commitment to the hatch as an opening. He’s not charging—but he’s close enough now that if he lunges, it’ll be a grapple on a narrow catwalk with open water to one side and a live relay whining behind you.

The immediate threat is a three-way bind: the hatch is open but not clear, the shielded figure is trying to break free while manipulating an inner lock, and the relay cradle is actively cycling—if it arcs, the wet bay becomes lethal.

### Turn 86 [PLAYER]

I slam my boot into the hatch edge to force it wider, then wrench the shielded figure’s reaching wrist down onto the door lip to pin it. “No secondary locks—open it NOW,” I growl, and I shove my shoulder through the gap, dragging them with me as a meat-shield. “Runner—stay there unless you want to light up the bay.”

*Agent reasoning: Hatch is the fastest exit; I can’t risk a grapple or that relay arcing. I’ll force the door fully, disable the shielded figure’s hand, and use the opening as a choke point while moving inside.*

### Turn 87 [GAME]

Your boot hits the hatch edge and the steel answers with a sharp *bang* that rings down the wall. The door jumps wider—two more inches—then stops dead against something inside. Not a free-swinging hatch: there’s a short restraint chain or bar limiting travel.

You wrench the shielded figure’s reaching wrist down onto the door lip. The glove squeals on metal; their wrist hits the edge with a dull, ugly thunk. They gasp—pain, real—and their fingers spasm open. Whatever they were about to do inside, they don’t finish it.

“No secondary locks—open it NOW.”

They choke out, “It’s— not—” and you feel them try to pull their arm back, but you’ve got bone and leverage on the lip.

You shove your shoulder into the gap anyway and force your head and upper torso through. The air inside is dry and warm—until your shoulder catches the restraint chain. It bites into your clavicle area and halts you. You can’t just bull through; you’re half-in, half-out, pinned at an angle with the shielded figure dragged tight against you.

Inside the maintenance corridor, a dim amber glow pulses once—like an indicator waking up. You hear a relay click deeper in, then a low, steady hum starts, as if something just accepted a load.

Back on the catwalk, the Tidewarden runner flinches at the new hum. He doesn’t advance—your threat plus the sound change makes him hesitate—but he does something worse: he drops to a knee and reaches to his belt for a line hook, eyes on your legs and the narrow space you’ve wedged yourself into. “I’m not stepping into your arc,” he says, voice controlled. “I’ll just pull you back out.”

The relay cradle behind you answers the corridor’s hum with a rising whine, syncing—too clean. The indicator goes steady for a full second again.

The shielded figure, pressed between you and the hatch, uses your awkward angle: they drive their helmet back into your face/neck line (wherever they can reach), trying to stun you and free their arm long enough to grab the chain release inside.

Immediate, concrete threats:
- You’re physically stuck on the restraint chain; you can’t fully enter or retreat fast.
- The runner is preparing to snag and yank you off the hatch with a line.
- The relay system is synchronizing with something inside the corridor; if it arcs with the wet bay, it won’t be a scare—it’ll be a kill.

### Turn 88 [PLAYER]

I tuck my chin and slam my head/shoulder forward to spoil their helmet-butt, then jam my forearm across their throat line and bark into the gap, “Chain release—now!” while my free hand gropes inside along the door edge for the chain clip/pin. If I find it, I pop it and dive through, dragging them in and kicking the hatch toward closed behind us.

*Agent reasoning: I’m jammed on the chain and about to get yanked; fastest is to neutralize the shielded figure and get the chain release so I can slip inside before the runner hooks me.*

### Turn 89 [GAME]

You tuck your chin and drive forward. The shielded figure’s helmet-butt turns into a glancing scrape—visor edge skitters off your shoulder/neck instead of cracking your face. It still jolts you, but you keep your balance.

Your forearm jams across their throat line where the suit collar meets the helmet ring. They gag on a filtered breath and their hands come up instinctively to pry you off.

“Chain release—now!”

Your free hand snakes through the crack, feeling along the inside edge: cold steel, then a taut length of chain. The limiter isn’t a simple clip—it’s a stamped bracket with a spring pin seated into a hole. Someone set it up to be quick *for a gloved hand that knows where to press*, not for a blind grab.

You find the pin head anyway. You hook it with two fingers and yank. It doesn’t budge—until you press inward first, then pull. The spring gives with a sharp *snap* and the chain goes slack, slapping your wrist.

You dive through, dragging the shielded figure with you by the front of their suit. Your boot catches the hatch edge on the way in and kicks it toward closed.

Outside, the Tidewarden runner commits the moment you disappear: his line hook flicks out, metal clacking against the hatch frame—too late. The hatch slams most of the way shut on the line, pinching it. The runner yanks; the door shudders but holds on the seal.

Inside the corridor, you and the shielded figure hit the dry floor hard—dust puffs up, gritty in your mouth. The shielded figure twists and tries to roll away, one hand going to their wrist, the other reaching for something at their waist.

The corridor’s amber indicator stays on. The low hum is steady now, like a live feeder. Behind the hatch, the relay cradle’s whine peaks—and then drops into a quieter, loaded tone. Not dead. Working.

The hatch isn’t fully latched; it’s held nearly closed with the runner’s line trapped in the gap. You can hear him outside, breath close and angry: “Open it! You don’t know what you just tied into!”

Then, from deeper in the corridor, a second sound answers the hum: a slow, deliberate *tap… tap… tap* on metal, approaching from the dark ahead—rhythmic, patient, and close enough that it’s already in this corridor system.

### Turn 90 [PLAYER]

I stomp onto the runner’s line at the hatch gap and yank it inward to slack it, then slam my weight into the door to force it shut and trap/strip the hook if I can. I pivot and haul the shielded figure up by their harness, shoving them ahead of me toward the tapping. “Walk. Quiet. If you reach for that waist kit again, I break the arm.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re pinched between the runner at the hatch and something approaching in the corridor—priority is sealing the hatch and moving deeper fast. The shielded figure is armed and knows this place, so I need them controlled, not dead weight.*

### Turn 92 [PLAYER]

I stomp the runner’s line at the hatch, yank it inward for slack, then drive my shoulder and full weight into the door to slam it shut—if the hook’s in the gap, I try to strip it and leave him holding nothing.  
I pivot, grab the shielded figure by the harness, and shove them down the corridor toward the tapping. “Walk. Quiet. Touch that waist kit again and I break your arm.”

*Agent reasoning: Door first—stop the runner’s leverage and buy seconds. Then keep the “key” moving toward the objective and away from the hatch fight.*

### Turn 93 [GAME]

Your boot stamps down on the line where it’s pinched in the hatch gap. You grab it and yank inward hard.

It gives you a few inches—enough slack to feel the runner outside lose tension—then it bites again. The hook isn’t just caught; it’s braced against the frame.

You ram your shoulder into the hatch and throw your weight. The door slams, metal shrieking on metal. For a half-second it feels like it’ll seat—then the hook head skates, twists, and *pops* through the narrowing gap with a violent snap-back.

The line whips inward with it.

Not clean. Not nothing. The hook tears free, but it comes with a cost: the barbed head lashes across your forearm and opens a hot, stinging line through skin. Immediately wet warmth runs down to your wrist. Outside, the runner grunts and stumbles back, suddenly holding slack rope and cursing.

The hatch finishes closing with a heavy *clunk*. The seal catches. The outside sound drops to a muffled thud as the runner pounds once—then moves off, footsteps retreating fast along the catwalk. He’s not gone; he’s repositioning.

You pivot and fist the shielded figure’s harness. They jerk, but you haul them upright and shove them forward. Your threat lands: their hand freezes halfway to the waist kit, then rises empty and open.

“Walk,” you hiss. “Quiet.”

They stagger into motion, boots scraping dust. The amber-lit corridor runs straight for twenty paces, then angles left around a bulkhead. The tapping is closer now—no longer echoing. It’s on the other side of that bend.

As you push them, the shielded figure finally speaks, voice ragged through the helmet: “If it’s awake, you can’t—”

The tapping stops.

A beat of silence, then a low electrical *tick-tick* like a relay testing contact, coming from ahead at floor level. The steady feeder hum dips for a fraction of a second, as if something just took a bite of load.

Threat, clear and immediate: something in the corridor just changed state and is now close—around the left bend—quiet enough to have heard you, and tied into the live power you just stabilized.

### Turn 94 [PLAYER]

I yank the shielded figure back against the wall and clamp a hand over their chest plate to still them. “What is it—drone, trap, or person? Ten words.”  
Then I kill our noise: crouch, slide up to the corner low, and flick a pebble/bit of grit down the corridor past the bend to draw it out while I stay tight to cover.

*Agent reasoning: Something powered just woke up around the bend; speedrunner move is to avoid contact and get control—use the shielded figure for info and leverage, take the side angle fast.*

### Turn 95 [GAME]

You wrench the shielded figure back into the wall. Their shoulder plate thumps concrete; dust shakes loose. Your palm pins their chest plate; you feel their breathing jump under it.

“Drone,” they whisper, fast. “Line-walker. It sniffs load. It bites wire. It screams.”

Ten words, barely—enough.

You drop into a crouch and slide to the corner, keeping your profile low. The corridor floor here is dry grit over old tile; it still crunches under your knee despite your care. You pinch up a pebble of aggregate and flick it hard past the bend.

It skitters, clicks, then rolls to a stop.

Nothing moves for a heartbeat.

Then a thin, bright *chirp* snaps out—too sharp to be human. It repeats twice, slightly modulated, as if answering itself. The feeder hum trembles again, a quick sag-and-recover.

Something comes into view at floor level: a low, crablike shape the size of a toolbox, hugging the base of the far wall. Its shell is matte and salt-pitted; a small indicator on its back blinks amber-green in time with the chirps. Two stubby armatures probe the ground ahead like feelers.

It pauses exactly where your pebble stopped. One armature touches the pebble, taps it—*tap… tap*—the same rhythm you heard. Then the other armature lifts and angles toward the conduit run along the wall, as if “smelling” the cable.

A third sound joins in: a faint rising whine from inside the unit, like a capacitor charging.

The shielded figure behind you goes rigid under your hand and mouths, without sound: “Don’t let it latch.”

Behind the sealed hatch, muffled through metal, you hear a distant call and bootsteps on the catwalk—more than one set now—moving back toward your position.

The line-walker’s feeler touches the wall conduit and its indicator flips from amber-green to a hard, steady green. The charging whine climbs. It has found the live line, and it’s preparing to do exactly what it was built to do.

### Turn 96 [PLAYER]

I shove the shielded figure out around the corner first, hard, and follow low behind them. As the line-walker commits to the conduit, I stomp/kick it sideways off the wall and into the open, then drop my weight to crush its body before it can latch and scream. If it chirps anyway, I grab the shielded figure and sprint deeper down the corridor, away from the hatch.

*Agent reasoning: Drone’s about to latch and scream; stop it fast and keep moving before Tidewardens stack at the hatch. Use the shielded figure as bait/shield, then disable the drone physically and advance.*

### Turn 97 [GAME]

You slam the shielded figure out first. They stumble into the bend with a sharp boot-scrape and a clipped grunt—loud in the hard corridor.

The line-walker reacts instantly: its steady green indicator flicks to a flashing pattern and it spits a rapid *chirp-chirp-chirp* that turns into a thin, rising squeal.

You’re already moving.

Your boot catches it square from the side just as its feeler armature starts to settle onto the conduit. The unit skids out into the open, flips half over, and its armatures scissor wildly, searching for purchase.

You drop your weight onto it.

There’s a brittle *crack*—ceramic and plastic giving—followed by a sharp metallic *ping* as something inside snaps free. The squeal cuts out mid-note.

But the damage doesn’t end cleanly. One armature, still energized, rakes across the conduit as it dies. There’s a bright blue-white *arc* and a violent pop. The corridor lights stutter; the feeder hum dips hard, then comes back with an ugly, uneven buzz. The air fills with the burnt-sweet stink of scorched insulation.

The line-walker lies twitching, indicator dead. No more chirps.

From behind, at the hatch end of the corridor, you hear the answer to that earlier alarm anyway: boots hammering closer on the catwalk outside and a voice raised—muffled but urgent—“—heard it! In the feeder run—”

The shielded figure, wide-eyed behind their visor, jerks their head down the corridor and hisses, “You just made it *hungry*.”

As if to prove it, a relay somewhere deeper in the run clacks twice—*tick… tick*—and the uneven buzz steadies into a higher, tighter whine. Something downline just reconfigured around the fault you created, and it did it fast.

You can go deeper, but now the corridor behind you is converging footsteps and attention, and ahead the live system is actively responding to what you’ve broken.

### Turn 98 [PLAYER]

I grab the shielded figure’s harness and haul them into a sprint deeper down the corridor, away from the hatch. “Next junction or access niche—now. Point or I drop you.”

*Agent reasoning: We tripped an alarm and drew Tidewardens; lingering gets us pinned at the hatch. Fastest is push deeper to a junction or service niche to break line-of-sight, then decide whether to ditch or use the shielded figure as a guide.*

### Turn 99 [GAME]

You fist the shielded figure’s harness webbing and haul them into a run. They lurch, then find their feet, boots slapping the dry grit as you drive them forward.

“Next junction or access niche—now. Point or I drop you.”

They don’t argue. Their left hand shoots out, stabbing down the corridor. “Service recess—thirty meters. Left. Low door. Jammed—kick it.”

You sprint into the amber wash. The corridor narrows slightly, old cable trays overhead like ribs. The hum is louder here, and the air is warmer—live equipment somewhere close. Your forearm wound slicks your grip; blood smears the harness.

Behind you, the hatch end isn’t just footsteps anymore. Something hits metal—hard—and you hear a shouted order, clearer through the concrete now: “Cut the seal—she’s inside!”

At twenty meters, the floor changes—grated section over a drainage slot. Your steps ring. The shielded figure stumbles on the grate; you keep them upright by the harness and don’t slow.

At thirty, there’s the recess: a shallow alcove on the left with a knee-high panel door and a corroded latch. Above it, stenciled in faded municipal block letters: **HANDHOLE / FEEDER TAP**. The door sits proud by a finger’s width—warped, not fully seated.

The shielded figure plants a boot and kicks. The latch gives with a harsh snap; the door swings inward on one hinge, scraping concrete. A breath of colder air spills out, carrying wet stone and old copper.

Inside is a cramped access crawl: shoulder-width, dropping down at a steep angle. You can fit, but not fast, and not together.

As you reach it, the corridor lights behind you flicker twice—quick, deliberate—like a signal. The hum tightens into that higher whine again, and a new sound threads through it: a faint, fast clicking that’s not footsteps.

The shielded figure points down into the hole with a trembling hand. “Down. Now. Before it sends another walker.”

From the far end behind you, a beam of white light lances around the bend—someone has a strong lamp and they’re closing.

### Turn 100 [PLAYER]

“Down first—move!” I shove the shielded figure into the handhole and drop in right after them, one hand on the hinge to swing the panel mostly shut behind us; if it won’t close, I jam it with my boot and yank the loose latch hardware to make it look seated.

*Agent reasoning: We’re about to get lit up; fastest is to get out of the corridor. The crawl is single-file, so I send them first as a shield/guide and follow immediately, then block the entrance to buy seconds.*

### Turn 101 [GAME]

You bark it and shove. The shielded figure drops into the handhole on their knees, scrabbling for purchase on the steep, gritty slope. Their shoulder clips the sidewall with a hollow *thunk*.

You follow immediately, twisting sideways to fit. The space is tight enough that your packless shoulders still scrape concrete. Your boots find the angled run and you half-slide, half-crawl in after them.

With one hand you catch the warped panel and swing it most of the way shut. It doesn’t seat—one hinge is bent and the door hangs proud. You jam the toe of your boot against the inside edge and lever hard. Concrete grinds; the door shifts a fraction.

The latch hardware is loose and half-ripped. You yank it down and twist it into place like a fake lock. From outside, it now *looks* shut—crooked, but shut.

A second later a white beam washes across the door seam, thin as a knife. It pauses. You hear a breath, then a voice right outside—close enough that the words carry through the gap.

“Here. Handhole panel—warm. Fresh scrape.”

Metal taps the door—*tik… tik*—testing. Another voice, lower: “Don’t open it. If it’s live tap, it’ll arc.”

A third sound answers them: rapid, dry clicking, like a hard insect. Something small skitters past the panel outside, and the light tracks it for a moment.

Inside the handhole, the shielded figure freezes, visor tilted up toward you. In the dim, you can see their pupils wide behind the scratched faceplate. They whisper, “They’ve got a listener.”

Down the crawl, the passage drops another meter into darkness where a cable bundle disappears into a side throat. A faint draft tugs from that direction—cooler, wetter air—suggesting an exit or a larger void beyond.

Outside, the tapping stops. The low voice says, crisp now: “Mark it. Hold this corridor. We wait them out—or we smoke them.”

Something scratches chalk on concrete near the panel. Then the light pulls back, but the rapid clicking remains, circling just outside your door like it’s mapping the seam.

### Turn 102 [PLAYER]

I lean in close to the shielded figure. “Point me to the exit void—now. If you freeze, I leave you.”  
Then I keep low and move down the crawl toward the cable bundle and side throat, careful and quiet, dragging them along by the harness if they hesitate.

*Agent reasoning: They’re camping the panel and have a listener; waiting gets us smoked. Fastest is push deeper into the side throat and put distance/turns between us and the door. Also need the shielded figure to lead without slowing me down.*

### Turn 103 [GAME]

You get your mouth close to their visor. “Point me to the exit void—now. If you freeze, I leave you.”

They swallow audibly. Their gloved hand lifts and points down the slanted run, then angles two fingers toward the cable bundle where it vanishes into the side throat. “Past the bundle—there’s a splice chamber. Half-flooded. Big enough to stand. There’s a ladder ring up—if it isn’t cut.”

You stay low and move. The concrete is damp here; grit turns to a slick paste. The shielded figure hesitates at the steeper drop, and you don’t wait—you drag them by the harness. Their knee pads scrape, loud in the tight space.

Outside the panel, the fast clicking changes pitch—quicker, excited. Something *taps* the metal door from the other side, not a human test: a light, repeated pecking right along the seam you forced.

Then a voice, farther down the corridor outside, calls: “It’s moving—hear it? In the wall.”

Another answers: “Listener’s got it. Don’t open. Find the next access and cut it off.”

You reach the cable bundle: thick, old catenary and feeders wrapped in cracked rubber, cinched with corroded straps. The side throat is a rectangular bite out of the wall, just big enough to worm through. Cold air leaks from it, and with it the smell of stagnant water.

As you push into the throat, your shoulder brushes the bundle. The insulation is heat-soft in places from the live run above; it gives under pressure. A faint static hiss rises.

The shielded figure catches it too and hisses, panicked, “Don’t—don’t press it—”

Too late to undo the contact: a tiny blue spark snaps somewhere in the bundle, bright as a pinprick, and the handhole behind you answers with a sharp *clack*—a relay reacting to the fault.

Immediately, outside, boots start moving again—fast. Someone shouts, “There! It tripped—second panel, downline!”

You’re in the side throat now, both of you, shoulders scraping. Ahead, the passage opens into a larger void: you can hear it—space and water—an echoing drip and the low lap of a half-flooded chamber. But you’ve also just given them a clear indicator of your direction, and they’re repositioning to cut you off at the next access.

### Turn 104 [PLAYER]

I shove through into the splice chamber and whisper, “Find the ladder ring—now.” If it’s there, I haul myself up first and then yank them up by the harness; if it’s cut, I move along the chamber edge in the shallowest water, killing our noise and looking for any secondary duct or overflow culvert to slip into.

*Agent reasoning: We’ve been tagged by the relay trip, so speed matters; get into the splice chamber, break line-of-pursuit, and use water/structure to mask sound. If there’s a ladder ring, we take vertical immediately.*

### Turn 105 [GAME]

You belly out of the side throat and drop into the splice chamber on your hands, then your boots. It’s a squat concrete room with cable racks on three walls and a ceiling lost in dark. Water covers the floor ankle-deep near the throat and rises to mid-shin toward the center, oily with algae sheen. Every drip lands loud.

“Find the ladder ring—now.”

The shielded figure splashes one step, catches themselves, then moves with careful, short shuffles along the wall, palm skimming concrete. You do the same on the chamber edge where the water’s shallowest, forcing your breathing quiet.

They find it—fast. A rusted ladder ring set is bolted into the wall under a square ceiling hatch. But the top three rungs are gone, cut clean, and the hatch above has a new hasp welded across it. Someone sealed it from the other side.

The figure looks back at you and shakes their head once, tight and scared. “Cut. And welded.”

Up in the throat behind you, the rapid clicking returns, louder now—no longer muffled by the panel. Something is coming through the same way you did.

Then: a human voice, close in the throat, amplified by the concrete. “Splice chamber. Don’t go in the water—watch the racks. She’ll hug the wall.”

A bright white beam stabs into the side throat mouth, jittering as whoever holds it tries to see around the bend. The light hits the water and blooms across the chamber, washing your legs and the cable racks in hard glare.

The clicking creature appears at the throat lip: a fist-sized, crab-like walker made of scavenged brackets and ceramic bits, its legs ticking on concrete. A thin wire trails behind it like a leash. It pauses, then drops into the water with a sharp *tink* and starts skittering along the wall toward you, tracking the seam where water meets concrete.

Your “quiet edge” is now a lit line, and the walker is on it.

Along the opposite wall, half-submerged behind a curtain of hanging cable, you spot a low overflow culvert—an oval opening at waterline height. It’s big enough to squeeze through, but you’ll have to wade deeper to reach it.

Behind you, in the throat, boots scrape closer. Someone is about to commit into the chamber.

### Turn 106 [PLAYER]

“Culvert. Now—hold your breath and don’t thrash.”

I grab the shielded figure’s harness and drag them off the wall into the deeper water, cutting straight toward the hanging cable curtain; I kick up one hard splash behind us as a decoy, then shove through the cables and cram us into the oval overflow opening feet-first, getting our bodies out of the beam.

*Agent reasoning: Ladder’s blocked and they’re about to enter; the culvert is the only fast exit. The crab-walker is tracking the wall seam, so we cut across deeper water to break its line and slip through before they flood the room with people/light.*

### Turn 107 [GAME]

“Culvert. Now—hold your breath and don’t thrash.”

You hook two fingers under the shielded figure’s harness webbing and yank them off the wall. Water jumps to your knees, then higher as you cut toward the hanging cable curtain. The shielded figure chokes on a breath and clamps their jaw shut, trying not to flail.

You throw one deliberate, ugly splash behind you—heel scything the surface—sending a fan of water slapping the wall.

It works for half a second.

In the throat, the flashlight beam snaps to the splash with a sharp, trained reflex. A voice barks, “Contact—left!”

But the crab-walker doesn’t care about the decoy. It ticks straight toward the new disturbance—your wake—legs clicking faster as it angles in on you.

You hit the cable curtain. Dead lines and live-feeling jacketed runs slap your shoulders and face. Your forearm catches a loop and yanks it; something above groans as the rack takes the load. The chamber answers with a low metallic shiver.

You shove through anyway and find the oval overflow opening by feel at waterline height. You ram your boots in first, then force your hips through. The concrete edge bites your thighs. Behind you, you haul the shielded figure in by the harness; their visor bumps the lip with a dull *clonk*. They stifle a sound, but it still escapes—small and wet.

The beam loses you as you get your bodies out of its direct line. In the culvert, it’s instantly tighter—shoulders scraping, water cold against your back. It slopes slightly downward; water runs in a thin, constant sheet beneath you.

Back in the splice chamber, you hear the first pursuer step in—splash, careful. “They went into the racks—watch the lines.”

Then a sharp *tink-tink-tink* as the crab-walker hits the cable curtain and starts probing it. The trailing wire goes taut.

A second voice, closer now, says, “Listener’s on a leash. Follow it.”

The threat is immediate and concrete: they’re using the walker to lead them to the culvert mouth, and the leash-wire is already being drawn across the cables toward where you disappeared. If it catches the culvert lip, they’ll know the exact hole.

In the culvert, the shielded figure’s breathing is too fast—fogging their visor in short bursts. Ahead, the duct bends after a few body-lengths into darker flow, and you can hear a faint, distant rush—like water dropping into a larger drain.

### Turn 108 [PLAYER]

“Breath slow. Move—now.”

I shove the shielded figure ahead into the bend and crawl after them hard, then reach back toward the culvert mouth to catch the leash-wire if it skates the lip—yanking it sideways into the water to foul it and snap it if it’s brittle.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to trace us with the leash; we need to break line-of-trace fast and quiet. Use the bend as cover, shove the other along, and if possible snag/cut the wire when it scrapes the lip.*

### Turn 109 [GAME]

“Breath slow. Move—now.”

You shove the shielded figure into the bend. They go, elbows and knees scraping, forcing their breaths into smaller pulls. The culvert narrows a touch at the turn; their harness catches for a second, then pops free with a wet squeal of fabric.

You crawl after them hard, then twist and reach back toward the mouth, arm extended into the colder backwash. For a heartbeat there’s nothing—just the thin sheet of water sliding past your wrist and the echo of voices in the chamber.

Then the leash-wire arrives.

It skates the culvert lip with a faint metallic hiss and taps your knuckles. You hook it and yank sideways, driving it down into the water and against the concrete edge, trying to foul it. The wire bites your palm—thin, sharp. You feel it cut skin.

In the splice chamber, the crab-walker reacts instantly: its clicking turns frantic, and it scrabbles at the curtain as the leash goes taut. You pull harder.

The wire doesn’t snap. It’s newer than it sounded—braided, with a stiff core. Instead, your yank drags the line across the culvert mouth and *saws* it against the lip. You get a moment of slack—enough to think you’ve bought it—

—and then the line jerks back the other way, hard, as someone in the chamber hauls.

Your arm slams into the culvert edge. Pain flashes up to your elbow. The wire slips, leaving a hot slice across your palm, and whips back out of your grasp.

A voice outside, satisfied and close, carries into the duct: “Got it. She’s in the overflow. Hook light—now.”

White light floods the culvert mouth, angled in. It doesn’t reach the bend, but it turns the water between you and the opening into a bright ribbon that gives your position away by wake and shadow.

The shielded figure freezes ahead, then starts moving again when you bump their boot. Their breathing has steadied, but now it’s loud in the tight concrete.

Behind you, you hear boots in the splice chamber shifting to the culvert, and metal clinks—someone handling hardware. The threat is immediate: they’ve confirmed your escape route and are preparing to push something into the duct (a grab hook or a line) to either snag you or force you deeper where the drop-sound is coming from.

Your palm is bleeding into the flow, and the duct ahead slopes toward that distant rush.

### Turn 110 [PLAYER]

“Keep crawling—don’t stop for anything.”

I clamp my bleeding palm against my sleeve, then shove forward hard into the slope toward the rush, aiming to get us past the next bend and to any drop; if we hit a fall, I go first and drag them after, using the water to mask us and break their hook line.

*Agent reasoning: They’ve got the culvert confirmed and are about to fish us with hooks/lines; best play is to create distance fast and use the bend/drop to break line-of-sight. If there’s a vertical drop, commit and let water cover our sound; keep the shielded figure moving.*

### Turn 112 [PLAYER]

“Keep crawling—don’t stop for anything.”

I mash my bleeding palm into my sleeve to slow it, then drive forward down the sloping culvert toward the rushing sound, staying tight to the bend; if it breaks into a drop, I go first and immediately haul them after by the harness to keep us moving and foul any hook line in the churn.

*Agent reasoning: We’re compromised at the culvert mouth; the fastest way to break line-of-sight and any hook/line is to commit deeper past the next bend and use any drop/whitewater as cover.*

### Turn 113 [GAME]

You clamp your palm to your sleeve and crawl hard, forcing speed into the narrow slope. The shielded figure scrapes forward ahead of you, boots skittering in the thin sheet of water.

You hit the next bend too fast.

Your right boot slides on slick silt over broken aggregate. Your knee shoots sideways; your shoulder slams the wall. Something under the silt gives—loose concrete flakes—and your momentum drives you into a rebar nub that’s been waiting in the seam. It bites cloth, then skin at your thigh/hip line, and stops you dead.

The impact makes a sharp, flat *CRACK* that runs down the culvert like a gunshot.

Ahead, the shielded figure jerks, half-turning in panic, their visor catching a smear of your lightless silhouette. They start to come back—then hesitate, trapped by the tightness and your order.

Behind you, from the splice chamber, a voice snaps instantly, closer than before: “Hear that? She ate it. Push the hook—now!”

Metal scrapes on concrete at the culvert mouth. A hooked head or grappling prong clinks in, dragged on a line, probing along the water ribbon. The angled light at the mouth intensifies, and a second shadow leans in, careful not to enter fully.

Water pulses higher for a moment—one of the drowned outskirts’ slow breaths—and the sheet thickens around your ribs. You’re pinned at the bend: your clothing is snagged on rebar, your leg is in the narrowest choke, and the next pulse will float you just enough to tighten the snag if you thrash.

You *can* get free, but not by brute force. You’ll need to go prone, back yourself a half-body length to take tension off the snag, and work the fabric off the rebar point—preferably wrapping it with cloth first—while timing your movement with the water’s retreat. Meanwhile the hook is advancing, clinking closer with each pull, searching for something to catch.

### Turn 114 [PLAYER]

“Don’t come back—keep crawling.”

I flatten fully prone and back myself a half-body length on the water’s retreat to slack the snag, then yank a strip from my sleeve and wrap it around the rebar nub to blunt it. As the next pulse eases, I work the fabric off with short, controlled pushes—then shove a loose chunk of concrete/silt downstream toward the hook to give it something else to catch while I surge after the shielded figure.

*Agent reasoning: I’m snagged and they’re probing with a hook; fastest is to reduce tension, free the fabric cleanly, and keep the hook from reaching us by misdirecting it.*

### Turn 115 [GAME]

You hiss it forward—“Don’t come back. Keep crawling.”—and the shielded figure obeys, pushing on into the dark slope until their boots are just a faint shape ahead.

You go flat, ribs in the water, and wait for the retreat. When it pulls back, you inch yourself a half-body length backward. The snag slackens immediately; the rebar nub stops biting deeper.

You tear a strip from your sleeve with your teeth. It comes away with a wet rip and a sting—your already-cut palm smears blood into the fabric. You wrap the strip around the rebar point, cinch it, and the sharp edge dulls under cloth.

Next pulse comes—water rises, lifts you a finger’s width. You don’t fight it; you use it. Short, controlled pushes: hip, then thigh, then fabric. The cloth on the nub takes the slide instead of your skin. Your pants peel free with a nasty tug, leaving a fresh scrape that burns but isn’t pinned anymore.

At the culvert mouth, the probing hook clinks closer, dragged along the concrete like a blind insect. The light flares again as someone leans in.

You grab a loose chunk of broken concrete and silt from the seam—more silt than stone—and shove it downstream into the thin flow toward the hook.

It works, but not cleanly.

The chunk breaks apart as it slides, and the hook *does* snag something—there’s a quick jerk on the line, a satisfied grunt—then immediate frustration as the line goes slack again.

“Trash,” the voice spits. “She’s still moving. Send the crawler—get eyes in!”

A new sound follows: low plastic scraping on concrete, and the rapid tick of small legs. Something smaller than a person is being pushed into the culvert behind the hook—an inspection crawler or a compact grab-sled—driven by the line, meant to follow you through the bends where their light can’t.

You surge forward after the shielded figure, knee and elbow pumping. Your torn sleeve flaps, and your palm leaves intermittent red smears on the concrete when you plant it wrong.

Ahead, the rushing sound resolves into a real change in grade: the culvert drops into a vertical spill a body-length wide. Water sheets over the lip into darkness. The shielded figure has reached it and is bracing, legs splayed, one hand on the wall—hesitating, listening to you and the pursuit behind.

Behind you, the crawler is in the duct now, coming fast—its scraping is steady and closing, and the line behind it hisses as it feeds.

### Turn 116 [PLAYER]

“Jump. Feet first—don’t grab the lip.”

I hook the shielded figure’s harness, shove them over the spill, and immediately drop after them, twisting as I fall to kick at the crawler’s feed-line if it follows—trying to wrap it on the edge or snag it on debris as we disappear into the plunge.

*Agent reasoning: The crawler will give them eyes; the fastest way to break pursuit is to take the drop and use the churn to tangle/snap its line. No time to scout—commit and pull the other with me.*

### Turn 117 [GAME]

“Jump. Feet first—don’t grab the lip.”

The shielded figure starts to turn—then you’re already on their harness. One hard shove and they go, boots disappearing over the spill. They drop with a startled, muffled cry that the water swallows.

You follow immediately.

The lip flashes past your shoulder. Cold water slaps your face as you fall through the spill-sheet, and you twist mid-drop, hunting for the crawler’s line with your heel.

Your boot catches it.

Not cleanly—more a hook-and-drag. The feed-line snaps tight across the edge above with a high, vibrating *twang*. For a split second you’re yanked sideways in midair, enough to wrench your hip and flare the scrape where the rebar got you. Then the line bites into something sharp at the lip—broken aggregate or a rusted bracket—and starts sawing.

You hit the plunge pool hard, feet first, knees buckling. Water closes over your head. Your torn sleeve balloons; your bleeding palm stings like fire in the churn.

The shielded figure is there, already fighting up, their harness strap in your hand. You both surface in a cramped, roaring sump: a round shaft chamber with a waist-deep boil and a low outlet tunnel that’s half-submerged, sucking water through with a constant pull.

Above, the line screams again—then *pops*.

Something drops after you: the crawler, or part of it, tumbling end-over-end. It hits the water like a brick, splashes once, then immediately gets taken by the outlet’s suction. You see a brief glint—plastic housing, a stubby lamp—before it vanishes into the half-drowned tunnel with a clattering scrape.

From the spill above, a voice echoes down, suddenly sharp with anger: “Line’s cut! She dropped the damn crawler!”

A second voice, farther back: “Get a light down there—NOW. Don’t go in blind.”

The shielded figure coughs, visor dripping, and tries to move toward the outlet—then freezes as the current tugs at their legs. The suction is strong enough to pull you off-balance if you step wrong; the outlet is your only way forward, but it’s actively trying to drag anything loose into it.

And somewhere in that outlet tunnel, the crawler is still scraping—alive or jammed, you can’t tell—making a hard, intermittent *tick…tick…tick* as it’s pushed along ahead of you by the flow.

### Turn 118 [PLAYER]

I grab the shielded figure by the harness strap and bark, “Low and sideways—crawl, don’t stand.” I shove us into the outlet along the wall, keeping my grip as a tether and using my feet to feel for the lip/ledge, pushing into the flow before their light reaches the shaft.

*Agent reasoning: Only exit is the outlet; hesitation means they get lights and follow. Need to control the shielded figure and avoid being sucked in wrong—use harness as tether and go low, fast.*

### Turn 119 [GAME]

“Low and sideways—crawl, don’t stand.”

The shielded figure obeys instantly. You keep a fist in their harness strap like a towline and angle both of you into the outlet with your shoulders against the wall. The current grabs at your hips and tries to spin you, but the wall gives you friction—enough to inch forward instead of getting swept.

Your boots find the lip: a narrow ledge on the left, just under the surface. You plant a heel on it and use it like a rung, pushing you both into the throat of the tunnel. The waterline drops from waist-deep boil to a fast, knee-to-thigh-deep sluice. You’re moving now, crouch-crawling, half-swimming.

Behind you, above the spill, light blooms—someone finally points a lamp down. The shaft brightens in a cone, but you’re already around the first shallow dogleg of the outlet. The light skates across the water and dies against the curve, leaving you in gray-dark again.

Up above, the angry voice carries, distorted by the falling water: “I saw ’em—into the outlet! Don’t let ’em—”

Then the sound changes: boots on concrete at the lip, a quick argument, and the unmistakable clatter of someone preparing to descend without committing to the drop.

In the outlet ahead, the crawler’s *tick…tick…tick* becomes louder—then stops abruptly with a hollow *thunk*. Something has jammed it.

You reach the obstruction within seconds: the tunnel narrows slightly where a partial collapse has left a jagged rib of concrete and rebar protruding into the flow. The crawler’s plastic body is wedged there, lamp still on, its beam shining straight back at you through the water like a low headlight. The current piles against it, making a louder, higher-pressure rush. It’s acting like a strainer—anything loose (cloth, straps, fingers) wants to get pulled into the gap around it.

The shielded figure flinches from the glare and tries to pull their head away, which yanks your tether arm. You both wobble; your scraped hip bangs the wall.

Above and behind, the shaft light intensifies again and a new sound joins it: a line paying out fast, hissing—someone has thrown a rope or feed-cable down and is about to follow the route you took, using the wall to avoid the drop.

You have forward progress, but the jammed crawler is now a hard choke point: to get past, you’ll have to either clear it or squeeze around it while the current tries to pin you to it—and the people behind are setting up to enter the outlet within moments.

### Turn 120 [PLAYER]

“Eyes down. Keep your strap tight—no loose ends.”

I press us flat to the left wall and edge around the crawler’s upstream side, using my shoulder and hip against concrete for friction while I guide the shielded figure by the harness through the narrowest gap. Once we’re past, I plant a boot on the crawler housing and kick it free/downstream to clear the choke and buy us seconds before the rope team rounds the bend.

*Agent reasoning: We’re about to get boxed in; fastest is to use the jammed crawler as a temporary plug, slip past, then dislodge it to slow pursuers. Don’t risk hands in the strainer—use feet/harness and keep the shielded figure from snagging.*

### Turn 121 [GAME]

“Eyes down. Keep your strap tight—no loose ends.”

You flatten to the left wall where the ledge gives you a few extra inches. The crawler’s lamp glares up through the water, turning the tunnel into a strobing smear every time the surface ripples.

You shove the shielded figure ahead by the harness, guiding their shoulder through the narrow gap between the wall and the wedged plastic. It’s tight enough that their tank/pack (whatever’s under that shielded rig) scrapes concrete with a squeal. The current tries to suck the loose harness tail toward the strainer gap, but your hand clamps it short and you physically pin their strap against their back as you push.

They make it past.

You follow, sliding your hip and shoulder along the wall for friction. Your torn sleeve catches a rebar whisker and rips again, but you keep moving. For a second your boot slips off the submerged ledge and the current yanks your shin toward the crawler—hard enough that your knee bangs the housing with a dull *clack*—then you recover and get your weight back onto the wall.

Now you’re downstream of it.

You plant your boot on the crawler’s casing and kick.

The first kick just flexes it in the jam. The second kick bites: you feel the housing shift, and a hidden rebar tooth that was pinning it snaps free with a metallic *ping*. The crawler lurches, rotates, and the current takes it immediately—yanking it out of the choke and shooting it downstream past your legs.

It doesn’t just “clear the choke.” It clears it violently.

A sudden surge of backed-up water slams through the gap you just threaded. The shielded figure gets clipped in the calves and almost faceplants; your grip on their harness keeps them from being swept fully off the wall, but you both get dragged a half-meter forward on your knees.

Upstream, around the bend, you hear the rope team hit the change in flow.

A voice barks, sharp and close now: “—current just changed! Something moved!”

Another answers, strained, as if bracing on the wall: “Hold the line—HOLD—”

Then a wet slap and a grunt as someone loses footing briefly and catches themselves. They’re in the outlet, but the sudden surge has made their entry messier and slower.

Downstream, the crawler clatters away ahead of you, lamp still on, bouncing off the tunnel floor and walls—its light now a moving beacon that will guide anyone chasing you through the bends unless it dies or gets buried.

The immediate threat is clear: you bought seconds by disrupting the rope team’s footing, but you also sent a bright, obvious marker ahead into your only route forward.

### Turn 122 [PLAYER]

“Keep moving—don’t look back.”

I lunge after the crawler, stomp the housing hard to try to crack it or flood the lamp, then immediately grab the shielded figure’s harness and push us onward at a crawl-run along the wall, aiming for the next bend to break line-of-sight from the shaft light.

*Agent reasoning: The crawler’s lamp will breadcrumb our path; fastest fix is to kill or blind it without stopping long, then keep moving before the rope team stabilizes.*

### Turn 123 [GAME]

“Keep moving—don’t look back.”

You lunge after the crawler, catching up as it skitters along the tunnel floor in the shallowest part of the flow. You bring your boot down hard.

Plastic cracks with a sharp *snap* and the housing caves. The lamp flares white for half a heartbeat—then gutters as water floods the broken seam. The beam collapses into a weak, underwater glow and finally dies completely. The crawler still scrapes forward for another meter, then goes quiet, tumbling once and lodging against a silt ridge.

Dark returns—real dark.

You’re back on the shielded figure’s harness immediately, shoving them onward in a low crawl-run along the left wall. With the light gone, you’re moving by touch: concrete texture under your palm, the ledge under your boot, the current’s tug at your calves.

You reach the next bend and round it. The shaft’s spill-light is gone now; line-of-sight breaks clean. The sound of pursuit is still there, though—water noise plus human noise, closer than you’d like.

From behind the bend, a voice snaps: “Light’s out! She killed it—she’s close!”

Another voice, lower and more controlled: “Keep the line. Feel the wall. Don’t chase the sound—follow the flow.”

Ahead, the outlet tunnel changes character: the ceiling drops. The air gap shrinks to a handspan in places, forcing you and the shielded figure into a half-submerged crawl. The current accelerates through the constriction, and the waterline rises to your chest when the floor dips.

Your shielded companion hesitates at the first low section, instinctively lifting their head—and bangs their visor/faceplate on the concrete with a hollow *bonk*. They curse, muffled, and their knees slip. The flow tries to roll them sideways into the deeper channel.

You can keep them pinned to the wall by the harness, but the next thirty feet are a nasty choice made physical: stay high on the wall-ledge and scrape through the low air gap, or drop into the deeper center and risk being pushed under by the fast water and the constricted ceiling.

Behind you, the rope line hisses again—closer. They’re rounding the bend by feel, and now they don’t need the crawler’s lamp to do it.

### Turn 124 [PLAYER]

“On my shoulder—now. Breathe when I tell you.”

I haul the shielded figure tight by the harness and drop us into the deeper center channel, using my body as a wedge and kicking hard to drive us through the constriction fast, forcing their head low and forward while I feel for the next rise in floor to pop us back to air.

*Agent reasoning: We need speed and separation; the rope team’s advantage is the wall/line, so I’ll take the riskier center to avoid scraping slow through the low ledge, and I’ll physically control the shielded figure so they don’t get rolled under.*

### Turn 125 [GAME]

You drop into the deeper center channel with them cinched to your shoulder by the harness, and the current immediately takes you—fast, cold, heavy. Your boots lose the ledge and for a moment you’re both just bodies in a pipe, driven by water.

It works: you shoot into the low-ceiling section with speed instead of getting stuck scraping along the wall.

It also costs you air.

The ceiling kisses the surface—barely a handspan—and the constriction forces your head down. You keep the shielded figure’s faceplate low and forward like you said, but the flow bucks over uneven concrete. A standing wave slaps you in the mouth and nose; you swallow brackish water and your throat locks for a second.

The shielded figure panics on instinct and tries to inhale at the wrong time. You feel it through their body: a sudden convulsion, a choke that turns into a muffled, wet cough inside the mask/hood. Their hands claw at your forearm and harness strap, not to fight you, but to find “up” that isn’t there.

You kick hard anyway, using your hips as a wedge to keep them from rolling. Something hard—rebar stump or broken aggregate—rakes your shin as you pass, tearing fabric and skin. The pain is sharp and immediate; warm blood threads into the cold flow.

Three body-lengths in, the floor rises like you were hoping. The current lifts you both, and you get a pocket—an actual air gap you can use. You shove the shielded figure up first.

“NOW,” you get out, more a rasp than a word.

They break the surface and suck air—ragged, wheezing. It’s air, but it’s thin and stinks of algae rot and old concrete. Their next breath turns into coughing again, wet and ugly, like they pulled water past a seal.

Behind you, around the bend, the rope team hits the same constriction. You hear a shout cut off by a splash and a hard *bang* of someone striking concrete. The line goes taut with a twang.

A voice—different from the earlier angry one, calmer—barks orders that carry through the water: “Don’t fight it. Let it take you through. Heads down. One at a time!”

They’re adapting.

Right now, you and the shielded figure are in a short, cramped air pocket with the low ceiling still forcing you to crouch half-submerged. The threat is immediate and specific: the shielded figure is coughing and may have aspirated water, and the pursuers are seconds to a minute behind and now know the technique to push through the choke.

### Turn 126 [PLAYER]

I grip their harness hard and snap, “Spit it out—short breaths. You can cough after we’re clear.” 

I feel along the ceiling/wall for any side pipe, rung, or maintenance notch; if I find one, I shove them into it first and follow to get out of the main flow. If there’s nothing, I force us back under and drive forward through the next low section fast, counting with hand squeezes—one squeeze for “hold,” two for “breathe.”

*Agent reasoning: We’ve got maybe seconds before they pop through; the companion’s compromised so we can’t dawdle. Best is keep moving immediately, use any side feature/manhole to break pursuit, and if none, push through the next stretch before they regroup—also keep them breathing and not panicking.*

### Turn 127 [GAME]

“Spit it out—short breaths. You can cough after we’re clear.”

The shielded figure tries. They spit a string of brackish water and take two fast, shallow pulls that sound wrong—raspy, bubbling at the edges—then clamp down hard, forcing the cough back like you ordered. Their whole body trembles with the effort.

You keep one fist in their harness and use the other to sweep the ceiling and left wall. Concrete—slime—then a seam. Your fingers find a metal edge: an old ladder rung set into the wall, half-buried in calcified silt. One rung, then another. Not a ladder up—more like a short maintenance “step” line leading into a rectangular bite in the wall.

A side notch. Tight, but real.

You shove them into it first. They wedge sideways, shoulders scraping, and for a second they stick—harness catching on a jag of rebar. You yank hard; the strap slides free with a squeal, and they tumble into the notch on their knees, coughing they can’t hold back anymore. It’s wet and violent, echoing in the small space.

You follow, hauling yourself off the main flow. In the notch, the water is lower—thigh-deep—and the current is a sluggish swirl instead of a pull. You can both breathe without being forced under, but the air is hot-stale here, like a sealed utility void that’s been “closed” for years.

Outside, in the main channel, you hear the rope team arrive at the air pocket you just left. A head breaks the surface with a gasp.

“Where—?” someone pants.

“Check the wall!” the calmer voice orders, immediate. “She’ll take a recess if there is one—hands on concrete!”

Light blooms around the bend: not a crawler lamp—this is a real beam, steadier, brighter. They’ve brought a hand light through.

The beam sweeps the ceiling line and catches the ladder rungs you just used. It pauses there.

“Rungs!” a diver hisses. You hear the rope line scrape as they pull themselves toward the wall.

In your notch, the shielded figure’s coughing fits into shorter bursts, but each one is loud. They try to stifle it against their forearm; it turns into a wheeze.

You bought refuge from the current, not from pursuit. The threat is immediate: they’ve found the entry markers and are closing on the notch, and your companion’s compromised breathing is giving you away by sound.

### Turn 128 [PLAYER]

I clamp a hand over the shielded figure’s mouth/vent area and hiss, “Quiet. Nod if you can move.” 

With my free hand I feel past them into the notch for any continuation—crawlspace, valve gallery, vertical ladder—anything. If it goes, I shove them forward immediately; if it dead-ends, I slip back to the rung edge, kill my own profile in the dark, and when the light hits the opening I kick at the lamp/hand and yank the rope line to dump the lead pursuer into the flow, then bolt back into the notch dragging my partner.

*Agent reasoning: They’re seconds out and have a light; hiding won’t work with coughing. Fastest is deeper into the notch if it leads anywhere, otherwise make a quick ambush at the choke to buy a gap and run.*

### Turn 129 [GAME]

You clamp your palm over the shielded figure’s mouth/vent area. Their next cough hits your hand as a hot, wet shudder. They flinch—eyes wide behind whatever they’re wearing—but they understand. They give you a small, tight nod: yes, they can move.

You feel past them into the notch.

It continues—but not as a generous passage. It’s a service crawl, rectangular and mean, sloping upward at a shallow angle. The first few feet are open enough to belly-crawl, then it necks down where old cable trays and mineral crust have narrowed it. Air moves through it: a faint draft that smells less like algae and more like dust and old insulation.

You shove them forward immediately. They go, scraping, shoulders catching. Their breathing is audible but muted now, forced small by your hand and the tight space. You follow, pushing at their boots and harness to keep them from freezing up at the pinch point.

Behind you, the searchlight beam lands squarely on the rung line and then the notch. It holds there.

“Hole,” the calmer voice says, close. “She’s in it.”

A gloved hand appears at the opening, fingers probing into the dark. The light tries to angle in—but the beam can’t get far past the first bend of the crawl.

“Too tight,” someone growls. “I’m not fitting with tanks.”

“Then strip,” the leader snaps. “Line stays on. One man goes in—no light inside, she’ll take it.”

Metal clinks. You hear a harness being unbuckled in haste, breath loud in the pocket outside. They’re committing to the crawl.

You force your partner through the narrowest choke. Their shoulder finally pops past with a gritty scrape that makes them jerk; they almost gasp, but you press them onward. Your own shoulders follow—painful, but you fit.

Then your hand finds something important: a cable bundle, still sleeved, running along the right side—recently re-tied with clean wire twists. New work in an old crawl.

At the notch entrance, the pursuers’ light vanishes for a beat as someone shifts position. A voice mutters, very near: “I’m going.”

A bare forearm slides into the opening. Fingers hook the rung edge, then reach deeper, feeling for you.

They’re seconds from making contact in the dark, and if they get a grip on your ankle or your partner’s harness, the rope team outside can simply haul you both back out into the flow.

### Turn 130 [PLAYER]

I hook my fingers under the newly-tied cable bundle and rip it hard toward me, trying to tear it free and drag it across the crawl as a snag. Then I kick backward blindly at the reaching arm and hiss to my partner, “Crawl. Don’t stop—follow the cable.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to grab us; fastest is deny purchase and create a forced delay. The new cable bundle can be used as a trip/entangle line or to yank something loose to block the crawl.*

### Turn 132 [PLAYER]

I hook both hands under the freshly-tied cable bundle and rip it toward me to tear it loose and drag it across the crawl as a snag, then I kick backward at the reaching arm and hiss, “Crawl—don’t stop. Follow the cable.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to grab us in the crawl; fastest is to create a snag/trip and keep pushing forward using the cable as a guide.*

### Turn 133 [GAME]

You get both hands under the cable sleeve and heave.

It doesn’t peel cleanly. Whatever’s “new” is the tie—what it’s tied *to* is old and stubborn. The sleeve bites your palms; the bundle shifts an inch, then another, and something gives with a sharp *ping*—a fresh wire twist snapping. The cable whips sideways across the crawl, sagging into a loose arc.

That arc is enough.

The reaching arm at the entrance pushes in farther, fingers searching. Your boot heel slams back into forearm and wrist. You feel bone under neoprene. The hand jerks, slaps the concrete, and withdraws with a choked hiss.

“Fuck—she kicked—!” the crawler says, voice tight with pain.

Outside, the leader barks instantly: “Hold him. Don’t let her take the line—get the light back on that hole!”

The searchlight flares at the entrance again, but it can’t see past the first bend—just your boot soles sliding away and the cable now hanging across like a tripwire.

You hiss to your partner. They crawl—fast, ugly, determined—dragging themselves by forearms, boots scraping. They keep one hand on the cable like you told them, using it as a guide in the dark.

Behind you, the injured pursuer tries again, this time leading with shoulder and head. The cable you dragged across catches him at the throat/shoulder line. He makes it half a body-length in before he’s pinned awkwardly, choking and swearing as he fumbles at it.

Then the real consequence hits: the cable isn’t dead.

A low, rising hum blooms through the sleeve—like a transformer waking up. The bundle twitches against your fingers, vibrating. Somewhere ahead, in the crawl’s direction, a relay or junction takes the load and the cable gives a sudden, hard *shiver*.

Your partner yelps as a blue-white snap jumps from the abraded sleeve to the damp concrete near their elbow. Not a full strike—more like a hungry bite—but it leaves a sharp, acrid smell and a blistering scorch mark.

The pursuer at the entrance freezes mid-curse.

“—It’s live!” he yells, panic cutting through the bravado. “It’s fucking live in here!”

Outside, the leader’s voice goes tight and controlled: “Back out. Now. Don’t touch the cable.”

You’ve bought a few seconds: they won’t follow into a live crawl blind. But you’re in a damp, narrowing conduit with an energized line you just tore loose and dragged across your only path. One wrong contact—your skin, your partner’s wet gear, the metal in their harness—and the crawl becomes a kill box.

### Turn 134 [PLAYER]

“Off the cable—now.” I grab the harness strap and yank my partner a half-body left, away from the sleeve, then use my boot to shove the live bundle down against the right wall and pin it there while we belly-crawl past without touching it.

As soon as I see any junction box, breaker can, or splice ahead, I go straight for it to kill power; if there’s no shutoff, I pull out my knife and only cut if I can do it through dry strap/cloth as insulation—otherwise we keep moving, slow and clean, no metal scraping.

*Agent reasoning: Live line in a wet crawl is a hard no—fastest safe move is to stop using it as a guide, isolate it from us, and get past it without contact; if there’s a junction/box ahead, kill power or cut it with insulated tools if I have any.*

### Turn 135 [GAME]

You yank your partner by the harness hard enough to peel them off the cable line. Their shoulder thumps the left wall; they grunt but keep moving. The live bundle is still quivering where you dragged it—sleeve abraded, copper close enough to taste in the air.

You plant your boot on it and grind it into the right wall. The vibration thrums up your shin like a tuning fork. For a heartbeat the sleeve smokes where rubber meets rough concrete, then the cable settles into a pinned curve. The crackle stops—no more arcing in front of your partner’s elbow.

You both belly-crawl past, keeping hips and elbows tight to the left. Your partner follows your line, careful now, breathing shallow.

Behind you, at the entrance, the pursuers don’t come in. You hear them shifting, not advancing—boots on concrete, someone retching a cough. The leader’s voice is clipped and close to the hole: “Mark it. Nobody in. Get me a hook-pole and a dry line. She can’t run forever in a crawl.”

A second voice—lower, uncertain—adds: “It’s humming like a feeder. Choir shit.”

Ahead, the conduit widens just enough to turn your head. You catch the dull outline of a squat metal can bolted to the ceiling: a junction housing, old municipal style, but with newer fasteners—clean hex heads that haven’t bloomed with rust. A short length of the same sleeved cable disappears into it.

You reach it and immediately feel heat: not burning, but warm like a live panel. There’s no external breaker handle—just a stamped lid with four corner bolts and a warning plate half-scraped away.

You can’t “switch it off” from outside. To kill it you’d have to open it, and that means metal on metal in a damp crawl with a live feed.

While you’re under it, your light (or whatever dim glow you have) catches something else: a thin copper filament laid along the left wall at knee height—newer than the concrete, almost invisible unless you’re looking for it. It runs toward the junction can, like a sense wire or trip line.

Your partner’s whisper comes ragged: “Mara—my arm.” Their sleeve is scorched near the elbow; skin beneath looks angry and wet. They can still crawl, but they’re shaken.

Behind you, the search team doesn’t enter—but you hear the scrape of something being dragged up to the entrance: a pole or hook, probing length. They’re adapting. And the live bundle you pinned? It’s starting to hum louder again as load shifts—your boot won’t hold it forever.

### Turn 136 [PLAYER]

“Keep crawling—arm later. Don’t touch any wire, not even hair-thin.”

I slide my knife out and, using the handle/flat (not the blade), I pin the thin copper filament to the wall and shove it down under a concrete lip so we don’t snag it, then I push past the warm junction can without opening it and drag my partner forward by the harness to gain distance before the hook reaches us.

*Agent reasoning: Opening a live junction in a wet crawl is suicide; fastest is to keep moving, avoid the trip filament, and put distance before they probe in with a hook. Partner’s arm needs quick triage without stopping long.*

### Turn 137 [GAME]

“Keep crawling—arm later. Don’t touch any wire, not even hair-thin.”

Your knife comes out slick in your palm. You flip it and use the flat of the handle like a thumb. The copper filament is finer than it looked—springy, work-hardened. When you press it into the wall it resists, then yields with a faint *tink* as it slides under a chipped concrete lip.

For half a second, nothing.

Then the warm junction can above you answers with a soft internal click—like a relay acknowledging a change. The feeder hum you’d been hearing shifts pitch, and a tiny red point—an LED the size of a pinhead, hidden under the can’s rim—flares once and dies.

You didn’t cut the filament, but you definitely *moved* it. Whatever it was sensing now knows it was disturbed.

You shove past the can without opening it, keeping your shoulder off the metal. You grab your partner’s harness strap and drag them forward. They scramble to keep up, boots scraping, breath loud in the tight space.

Behind you, the hook arrives.

Metal scrapes at the entrance, then the hooked end clatters into the crawl and starts fishing blind. It catches the live cable bundle you pinned, tugs it, and the bundle snaps free of your boot’s pressure with a harsh *rrrrp* of sleeve against concrete. The hum spikes. A bright blue snap jumps from the abraded sleeve to the hook’s tip.

A man screams—sharp, involuntary—followed by the hook pole clanging as it’s dropped.

“LET GO—LET GO!” someone yells outside.

The leader barks over it, furious: “Hands off metal! Use the dry line! DRY LINE!”

You gain distance while they regroup, but the crawl itself turns meaner: the air ahead tastes hotter and sharper, like ozone. The feeder hum is now behind you and above you through the concrete, as if the junction can is routing load elsewhere.

Your partner’s scorched elbow bumps the wall; they choke back a sound and keep crawling.

As you round the next shallow bend, you see why the air changed: the conduit ahead is threaded with more of that hair-thin copper, crisscrossed in shallow X’s near the floor like snares—some slack, some taut—leading toward another dark box recessed in the right wall.

This isn’t random wiring. It’s a deliberately instrumented crawl, and you’ve just told it you’re here.

### Turn 138 [PLAYER]

“Freeze. Eyes on the floor—those X’s are trip.”

I press myself flat, then slide my knife sheath/handle ahead as a feeler to find a gap, guiding my partner by the harness to crawl over the least-taut wire line without snagging it; if there’s no clean gap, I shift to the right wall and inch past the recessed box without touching it, moving slow for five seconds now to go fast later.

*Agent reasoning: The crawl is trapped with sensor wires; fastest is to avoid triggering more and slip past the box rather than messing with live electronics. I’ll use minimal contact, go high/low where the X-snares aren’t, and keep the partner moving.*

### Turn 139 [GAME]

You flatten out until your ribs bite concrete and ease the knife sheath forward like a blind man’s cane.

The first X-snag is real: two hair-thin copper lines cross about a handspan off the floor, anchored with fresh epoxy dots. Your sheath nudges one and it gives a millimeter—taut enough to sing, not enough to slack. You pull back before it can vibrate.

You probe again, slower. There’s a gap—but it’s not where you want it. The only clean lane is tight to the right wall, directly under the recessed wall box.

You signal your partner by tension on the harness and inch right. Your shoulder passes within a finger-width of the box’s faceplate. It’s unlit and looks dead, but the concrete around it is cleaner, recently scrubbed.

You commit to the lane. You lift your chest just enough to slide forward without scraping.

Your partner follows—and their scorched elbow betrays them. The fabric is stiff and catches the lowest line. You feel it through the harness: a tiny *tick* transmitted up the wire, too light to be a full snag but enough to pluck it.

The recessed wall box answers immediately.

A sharp internal *click*, then a thin tone—barely audible, like a mosquito whine—starts pulsing in the conduit. Not loud, but unmistakably intentional. The copper X’s don’t move; nothing “springs.” This isn’t a snare meant to trip you physically. It’s an alarm and a locator.

From behind, muffled through the bend, you hear the leader outside the entrance snap to it: “There—hear that? She’s on the instrumented run. Keep the dry line moving. Don’t rush the feeder.”

A different voice (closer than before, uncertain) mutters: “Choir wiring… Why would the Choir wire this close to Nine?”

The immediate threat is now clear: they can track you by the tone and close in with nonconductive gear. And the box you’re brushing past is likely the node that’s listening.

You do get past the first set of X’s without fully snagging them, but the conduit ahead continues with more filament runs—denser, closer together—leading deeper along the right wall. The tone keeps pulsing, steady as a metronome, marking your position as you crawl.

### Turn 140 [PLAYER]

I grit my teeth. “That tone’s our leash—cover your ear and crawl on my pull.”

I press my sleeve and a wad of cloth (shirt tail) hard over the recessed box seam to muffle it, then jam a small dry chip of concrete into the gap to crush/pin whatever’s vibrating without using the blade; if it doesn’t shut up in two seconds, I abandon it and drag my partner forward—fast—staying low and keeping us off the right-wall wire runs.

*Agent reasoning: The tone is a tracker; fastest fix is to stop it or spoof it. Opening boxes is risky, so I’ll try to physically muffle/damage the sounder with minimal metal contact, then move fast while they hesitate about the live feeder.*

### Turn 141 [GAME]

You slap your sleeve and a torn wad of your shirt-tail over the recessed box seam and lean your weight into it. The tone dulls a hair—still there, but less sharp.

You find a dry concrete chip in the grit and jam it into the seam like a wedge, grinding with your thumb.

The box doesn’t “buzz” the way you hoped. It *clicks* again—harder—and the tone stutters for a fraction of a second like you’ve interrupted it… then comes back louder, higher, and faster. The LED you didn’t see before flashes twice through a pinhole near the faceplate.

You’ve made it worse: whatever’s inside is now in an alert state, not just a passive ping.

Worse still, your cloth and sleeve are now pressed against a live environment. Not full feeder voltage, but enough: you feel a hot sting through damp fabric at your forearm—like a wasp bite—followed by a numb prickle. You jerk back instinctively. No burn-through, but it’s a warning: the box has potential on it, or it’s capacitively coupled to the run.

Behind you, the pursuers react immediately to the new cadence.

“That’s a confirm!” the leader barks, voice carrying around the bend. “She touched the node. Keep the dry line—hook stays OUT. Two up, slow and steady!”

You hear the rasp of something being unspooled—rope, not metal—then a soft *thup* as a weighted line is fed into the crawl. They’re preparing to snake it forward, either to snag harness straps or to trip you without shocking themselves.

You abandon the box inside your two seconds and drag your partner forward by the harness, faster. Staying off the right wall is harder now: the wire runs are denser and the “safe” lane narrows to a shallow groove down the center. Your partner’s breathing turns ragged; their injured arm trembles but they keep to your pull.

The tone continues—now rapid, insistent—tracking with you as you move. It isn’t muffled anymore. It’s following the circuit deeper ahead, meaning there are more nodes, not just the one you tried to choke.

### Turn 142 [PLAYER]

“Unclip anything that dangles—now. If you’ve got a belt loop or strap, tuck it.”

I snap my own loose straps tight and smear my shirt-tail back flat, then speed-crawl down the center groove, listening for any change in airflow or a drop shaft; if I spot a side access or vertical riser, I take it immediately and kick grit back behind us to foul their dry line.

*Agent reasoning: The alarm’s now in full alert and they’re feeding a dry line to snag us. Fastest way to break pursuit is to force a choice point—water/vertical/maintenance hatch—anything the line can’t follow, and to make ourselves harder to hook by shedding snag points.*

### Turn 143 [GAME]

Your partner fumbles at their harness with one good hand. A loose strap gets tucked; a metal clip stays—no time to unthread it without stopping. They nod once, jaw clenched, and keep moving when you pull.

You cinch your own slack down and smear the shirt-tail flat to stop it snagging. Then you commit to the center groove and speed-crawl.

The tone stays rapid, but your ears catch something else: the airflow ahead changes—cooler, moving left-to-right across the tunnel instead of straight down it. That usually means a side access that’s breathing into a larger void.

Three body-lengths ahead, you find it: a narrow side cut, half-choked with cable stubs and flaked conduit, but it drops into a vertical riser shaft—dry rungs bolted into concrete, going up into black.

You take it immediately, pivoting hard left and hauling your partner after you. As you climb, you kick grit and loose aggregate back into the crawl mouth.

It works—partly. The grit avalanches down the groove and pings off the copper filaments with tiny ticks. Not enough to set off a new cadence (it’s already screaming), but it does make the floor behind you unstable and dusty.

Below, the pursuers’ dry line arrives. You hear the weighted end scrape into the grit and then *stick*, dragging sluggishly instead of sliding clean.

“Line’s fouled,” someone reports, irritated.

“Push it through,” the leader snaps. “She went left—air changed.”

A pale beam slices into the crawl mouth—kept low, careful not to rake the wires. They’re adapting fast.

Up the riser, your hands find rungs that are dry but slick with salt. Your partner’s injured arm slips once; you catch their harness and they slam a knee into the concrete, swallowing a cry.

Above you, a hatch outline appears—newer bolts, different metal than the surrounding frame. It’s shut, but there’s a narrow gap at one corner where air is leaking through, cold and clean compared to the crawl.

From below, the tone is still audible, but muffled by the shaft. The immediate threat is clear: they can’t follow fast through the wired crawl with metal, but they *can* feed rope up the riser or climb after you if they commit to it.

### Turn 144 [PLAYER]

I climb fast to the hatch, brace my boots on the rungs, and test the corner gap with my knife tip for a latch. “Up—now. One hand, use your legs.” If I can’t pop it in two seconds, I start backing the bolts out just enough to pry, then haul the hatch open and shove my partner through first, listening for rope or boots starting up the riser.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is the fastest exit and the cold clean air suggests a safer space; we need to breach it before they can get a line up the shaft. I’ll force it quietly if possible, then pull my partner through and block pursuit.*

### Turn 145 [GAME]

You climb hard, boots biting the rungs, and get your knife tip into the corner gap. There’s no simple latch. The edge flexes a fraction—enough to tell you it’s seated against a gasket and held by those new bolts.

You give it your two seconds anyway: a twist, a lever. Nothing. The hatch doesn’t pop; it just gives a dull, stubborn *thunk* back into its frame.

So you go to the bolts.

They’re hex-heads, not rusted slots—fresh enough that your knife is the wrong tool. You can’t “back them out” cleanly; you can only worry at them. You manage to turn one bolt maybe a quarter-turn by jamming the knife in the head and torquing, but the blade slips and skates. The bolt doesn’t come free.

Your partner is climbing, fast but ugly. “Legs,” you bark, and they do it—one hand, feet punching. Their breathing is loud in the shaft.

Below, you hear the pursuers commit. Boots on rungs now, not just rope: two sets, climbing cautiously but climbing. A rope weight taps metal—*ting… ting…*—as they send it up after you.

“Don’t touch the damn wires,” someone warns from below. “Riser’s clean—go, go.”

You make a decision on the fly: you can’t open it properly, but you can try to force it.

You wedge the knife into the corner seam and pry with your forearm and shoulder. The gasket squeals. The hatch shifts—just enough that the corner gap widens, and a stronger spill of clean air hits your face.

Then something inside the frame grabs. Not a latch—an internal catch meant to resist prying. The hatch *does* move, but it bites your knife and twists it sideways. You feel the steel flex, protesting.

You can keep forcing and risk snapping the blade, or you can drop back down the shaft before the climbers reach your level.

Your partner reaches your boots, panting, eyes wide. “It’s—stuck.”

Below you, the first climber is maybe six rungs down from the crawl mouth, coming steady. The rope line is being fed up behind them, ready to snag a leg or harness if it gets purchase.

### Turn 146 [PLAYER]

“Back down—now. Feet on rungs, don’t look down.”

I yank my knife free, drop two rungs fast, and start hammer-kicking the riser wall to rain grit and loose concrete straight onto the climbers and their rope weight, then keep descending to the side cut to take the next branch away from this sealed hatch.

*Agent reasoning: Knife is too valuable to snap and the hatch is hardened; fastest is to deny them the riser by using gravity and debris, then relocate to another exit rather than die at a dead end.*

### Turn 147 [GAME]

“Back down—now. Feet on rungs, don’t look down.”

Your knife comes free with a sharp *skree* and a jerk that nearly takes you off balance. You drop two rungs fast, then start hammer-kicking the riser wall.

The riser answers: not with a neat rain of grit, but with a nasty, hollow *crack* as a skin of old concrete delaminates. Chunks—fist to palm-sized—break loose along with dust and silt. They don’t just pepper the climbers; they come down like thrown rocks.

The first climber below throws an arm up and takes a chunk on the forearm with a wet *thud*. He yelps and loses a rung for half a second, boots scraping metal. The rope weight below him gets clipped by falling debris and swings, slamming into the rungs—*clang-clang*—before dropping. The line goes slack, then jerks as someone below hauls it back.

“Cover your face!” the leader barks from lower down. “Shield up—keep moving!”

They don’t retreat. They adapt: the second climber stops, presses tight to the ladder, and uses their shoulder and forearm like a shield while the first keeps climbing through the falling dust.

Your partner, already shaky, flinches at the noise and the dust. They start down after you, but their injured arm slips again; they catch themselves with their legs, scraping a knee hard enough to leave a dark smear on the rung.

You keep descending. The air in the shaft turns gritty; every breath tastes like powdered lime and rust.

By the time you reach the side cut, you’ve bought seconds—not distance. The climbers are still coming, slower now but steady, coughing and swearing, rope line retracted and being re-fed more carefully.

You drop into the side access and drag your partner after you. The wired crawl beyond is still there—center groove, dense runs on the right, and that rapid alert tone deeper in. Your kicking has also changed the shaft: debris now litters the rungs and the throat of the side cut, making the footing worse for *everyone*—including you if you have to come back this way.

As you push into the crawl, you hear the leader below the riser call out, clearer than before:

“She’s doubling back into the wire lane. Don’t chase with metal. Send the hook-pole man to the mouth—now.”

That means they’re not just following; they’re trying to get ahead of you from the other end.

### Turn 148 [PLAYER]

I grab my partner’s collar/harness and hiss, “No more straight lines—they’re cutting us off.” We backtrack ten meters just enough to hit the first junction/maintenance notch I remember, then I take the lowest, wettest bypass I can find and smear both our fronts in mud to kill snag points; as we move, I shove loose debris into the center groove behind us to foul any rope line without pinging the right-wall wire runs.

*Agent reasoning: They’re trying to leapfrog to the other mouth; staying in the main crawl is a trap. I need an alternate route fast—preferably a maintenance bypass or wet line they won’t risk—and I need to slow the climbers without touching the wires.*

### Turn 149 [GAME]

You clamp your partner by the harness and pull them backward. “No more straight lines—they’re cutting us off.”

Backtracking in the groove is like trying to run on glass. You do it anyway—slow, controlled, keeping your shoulder off the dense right-wall wire runs. Ten meters gets you to what you half-remember as a maintenance notch: a shallow recess where the wall steps in and the floor dips.

The “lowest, wettest bypass” is there—barely a bypass at all. A sagging strip of silt-skin over a narrow channel, darker and wetter than the rest, with a faint stink of foul manifold.

You smear mud across both your fronts—shirt, harness webbing, anything that could snag—and start across.

Your next hard step punches through.

The crust collapses with a soft *whump*, like a lung giving out. Your leg drops knee-deep into black, cold water threaded with rebar. Something catches your boot and yanks sideways. The backflow tugs like a hand, trying to pull you under the slab edge. Sewage gas burps up and burns your throat.

Your partner lurches as your grip on their harness turns into an anchor point—nearly dragging them down with you. They scramble, feet skittering, and slam a palm into the wall to keep upright.

At the same time, your shoving of debris into the center groove does what you wanted: it deadens the groove into a messy, dragging bed. But it also makes *your* retreat line worse—every movement now wants to slide toward the hole you just made.

And then the groove answers you with a new hazard: a thin, knee-high monofilament line you didn’t see—stretched across the groove at shin height, its anchor point visible under salt crust near the wall. As your body twists from the pull in the water, your free leg swings toward it.

If you clip that line, you hear a faint *click* from a recessed foul manifold—like a valve taking a breath.

Behind you, in the shaft direction, boots scrape closer—still on the riser, but descending toward the side cut. Someone coughs and spits.

“Hold—she’s in the wire lane,” a voice calls. “Listen for the tone shift.”

Right now: one leg trapped and being pulled by backflow; your partner teetering; and that tripline poised at your shin, ready to wake something in the foul recess if you hit it.

### Turn 150 [PLAYER]

“Plant your feet—brace me on the wall. Do NOT move forward.”

I freeze my swinging leg short of the monofilament, then reach down and saw at whatever’s snagging my boot with the knife; if it won’t give in a second, I slice the boot laces/upper and abandon the boot, hauling my leg out and rolling left into the notch to keep clear of the tripline.

*Agent reasoning: I’m about to set off a tripline and get sucked into backflow; fastest is stabilize partner, avoid the line, cut my boot free if needed, and get out before the climbers arrive.*

### Turn 151 [GAME]

Your partner plants their feet exactly where you tell them—back against the wall, knees bent, both hands on your harness strap like a belay. “I’ve got you,” they rasp, voice tight.

You lock your swinging leg in place. Your shin stops a finger’s width from the monofilament. It quivers from the air you displaced but doesn’t *sing* or snap—yet.

You bend down into the stink and jam the knife under the waterline, sawing at what’s got your boot. It’s not cloth or weed. The blade bites metal with a gritty scrape: a loop of rebar tie-wire or cable—thin but tough—cinched around the boot’s sole lug. The backflow keeps tension on it, making every cut fight you.

One second isn’t enough.

You make the call. Knife up, you slash the laces and cut into the softened upper. The boot gapes. Cold water rushes in. You wrench your foot out hard—skin on the heel tears a little, but the foot comes free.

Your partner hauls as you kick and roll left into the notch, keeping your legs low and away from the monofilament. You clear it cleanly.

Behind you, your abandoned boot stays in the hole for half a heartbeat… then the backflow takes it. It drags the boot under the slab edge and *pulls the snag line tight*.

From the recessed foul manifold you heard earlier: a distinct *click*, followed by a soft, building hiss—like a valve opening.

A thin sheet of water begins to pour from a seam in the recess, not a flood but a purposeful spill that starts to widen the collapse you just made. The crust at the edge sloughs away in slow bites.

Your partner stares at the spreading black water, then back at you. “What did you just trip?”

You didn’t touch the monofilament, but the boot and snag line effectively did something similar: they tensioned whatever was tied into that recess.

From the shaft-side passage, voices get closer—now in the crawl, not on the riser.

“Light low!” someone snaps. A beam sweeps, jittering off the groove walls. “There—movement. Don’t step the center.”

You’re in the notch with one boot on, one bare sock/foot, heel bleeding, and a bypass that’s actively getting wetter and less stable. The pursuers are seconds away from seeing the notch.

### Turn 152 [PLAYER]

I clamp a hand over my partner’s mouth and hiss, “Shut up. Move.” Then I scoop a double handful of wet silt and fling it low into the center groove toward their sweeping beam to muddy their view, immediately dragging my partner deeper into the notch and into the wet bypass on the left. I keep my bleeding foot up on the wall as we slide through, and I shove more loose debris into the groove edge to help the new spill undercut and make the approach nasty for anyone chasing.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to spot us; I need an immediate break in line-of-sight and a route change. The valve spill can become a barrier—use it—then slip into the wet bypass despite the injury, and remove anything reflective that gives us away.*

### Turn 154 [PLAYER]

I clamp a hand over my partner’s mouth. “Shut up. Move.” I fling a double handful of silt low into the center groove at the sweeping light, then drag them deeper into the left notch and commit into the wet bypass, keeping my bleeding foot high on the wall. As we slide through, I shove debris into the groove edge to help the spill undercut and make their approach a mess.

*Agent reasoning: We’ve got seconds before they spot the notch; fastest is blind them, commit to the left wet bypass, and make the approach collapse behind us.*

### Turn 155 [GAME]

Your hand clamps over your partner’s mouth hard enough to stop the breathy noise. Their eyes flare, then they nod once—understanding—and go still.

You scoop silt and fling it low into the groove just as the beam sweeps past. It doesn’t “blind” the light, but it turns the air into a gritty shimmer and makes the beam break up into a dirty cone. The sweep hesitates.

“Dust—she’s close,” one of them says, and you hear boots stop short. Someone taps the wall with a hook-pole, testing.

You drag your partner deeper into the left notch and commit into the wet bypass. It’s narrower than it looked: a half-submerged side run where the wall bows inward and forces you sideways. You keep your bleeding foot high on the wall, toes flexed, trying not to let the torn heel touch the water.

It works—mostly. Your calf shakes from the strain, and you clip the water once with your heel. It stings like salt in a cut.

As you slide through, you shove loose debris toward the groove edge. The new spill from the recessed seam does the rest: water threads under the crust and starts chewing it from beneath. The edge you just left behind turns into a soft, collapsing lip. A chunk the size of a paving stone slumps away with a wet crack.

The pursuers reach the problem almost immediately.

“Hold—floor’s going,” the lead voice barks. A boot steps onto the undermined edge anyway; it drops ankle-deep with a splash and a curse. The hook-pole jabs down, finds nothing solid, and the man yanks it back fast.

“Bypass left,” someone else says, sure of it now. “She’s in the side run.”

A second beam snaps toward the notch mouth—low, searching. It catches the churned water and the fresh scrape marks where you hauled your partner in. They’re not guessing anymore.

Then the undercut you encouraged takes another bite. The seam-spill widens, and the bypass entrance starts to sag. Not a full collapse—yet—but the ceiling grit begins to rain down in steady peppering. Your partner flinches as small stones ping off their shoulder.

You’re moving, but the bypass is forcing you to go slow and sideways. Behind you, the entrance is becoming a collapsing choke point. In front, the bypass bends into darker water, and you can hear it: a low, continuous *gurgle* like it’s feeding into a larger drop.

“Get the snare line,” the lead voice orders. “No—don’t step it. Anchor and probe.”

They’re setting up to follow you in without triggering whatever you woke.

### Turn 156 [PLAYER]

I lean to my partner’s ear. “No lights. Hold my belt. If I stop, you stop.” Then I push hard into the bend toward the gurgle, feeling for the lip of the drop with my booted foot and hand; if it’s a short fall, I slide us down it immediately, and if it’s a long one, I veer into any side seam or rung recess before the edge to avoid getting swept.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to probe in; I need distance fast and a hard obstacle. The gurgle sounds like a drop—use it to break line-of-sight and slow pursuit, even if it’s risky. Partner needs to stay quiet and close.*

### Turn 157 [GAME]

“No lights,” you breathe into their ear. Your partner’s hands find your belt and clamp down. Their grip is desperate but steady.

You push into the bend. The bypass narrows again and the water deepens to mid-shin, moving with purpose now—pulling, not just sloshing. You keep your booted foot probing ahead, one palm sliding along the wall for any change in texture.

Your hand finds it first: the wall turns slick-smooth for a handspan, then drops away. A scoured lip. The gurgle is a vertical pull.

You ease your booted toe over the edge. Nothing solid within a quick step. Your foot meets falling water and open space. Long drop.

You jerk back and flatten to the wall, whispering “Stop.” Your partner freezes instantly, belt-hold tight enough to bruise.

You feel along the wall just upstream of the lip, searching for anything engineered—rungs, a seam, a maintenance notch. Your fingers catch a narrow vertical joint packed with old sealant, then—there—an inset rectangle: a recessed service pocket half a forearm wide, just above the waterline. Inside, two corroded ladder staples run down out of sight.

You shove your body into the pocket, shoulder first, and pull your partner in behind you. The water tries to peel you off the wall toward the drop; it tugs at your legs like hands.

You hook your booted foot onto the top staple. It holds—barely—creaking under your weight. Rust flakes into the water.

Behind you, from the collapsing choke point, voices carry sharper now, closer, echoing in the bypass.

“Line in!” someone barks. Metal scrapes on concrete. A rope hisses out through wet hands.

A flashlight beam stabs into the bend—brief, low—then snaps off again as ordered. But it was enough: it glints off the wet wall and catches the pale edge of your partner’s knuckles on your belt before darkness swallows it.

“There!” the same voice says, certain. Boots splash into the bypass. The rope goes taut as they anchor it.

Your immediate problem is the staples: they descend into darkness, but they’re rotten. If you go down fast, one could shear. If you stay, the current keeps trying to drag your legs into the drop—and the pursuers are now committed into the bypass behind you with a line and probes.

### Turn 158 [PLAYER]

“On me—one rung at a time. Don’t hang, just step.” I drop my weight low, test the next staple with my booted foot, then descend fast but controlled, keeping three points of contact and spacing us so only one of us loads a rung at once. As soon as we’re a body-length down, I kick hard at the pocket edge to slough rust and grit and send it into the flow toward the lip, trying to make their probe/rope bite and pull them toward the drop.

*Agent reasoning: We’re about to get pinned at the lip; fastest escape is down the pocket. Reduce load on each staple and use the pursuers’ rope against them by forcing them into the current/drop.*

### Turn 159 [GAME]

“One rung at a time. Don’t hang—just step.”

You drop low and test the next staple with your boot. It flexes—alive in the wrong way—but it doesn’t peel out. You commit, keeping your chest close to the wall, hands on the side edges of the pocket to take some load off the metal. Your partner mirrors you, knuckles white on the belt, waiting until you’re a full body-length down before they move.

The descent works—fast, controlled—until the third staple.

Your boot finds it, presses, and the staple *shifts* with a gritty pop. The concrete around it is honeycombed; seepage has been eating it from behind. You pull your weight back onto your hands and the higher rung, but the movement vibrates the pocket.

Above, the lip answers with a wet crack.

The pocket edge you just kicked at doesn’t just shed rust and grit—it sheds *structure*. A slab of undermined concrete breaks free at the bypass lip and drops into the black water with a heavy, muffled *whump*. The current surges as if it’s been given a wider mouth.

And it takes you with it.

The pull hits your legs first, yanking them out and down. Your hands scrape off the pocket edge. For half a second you’re suspended, then you and your partner drop into black water that tastes like pennies.

Something catches—hard. Rebar.

A hooked length snags your clothing near the hip; another rakes your bleeding foot and catches the torn edge of your boot. Your partner’s belt-hand jerks, and they slam into you, choking back a sound as the undertow drags both of you toward a dead-end sump where the water churns in place.

Up above, the pursuers shout as the floor goes.

“Back—BACK!” the lead voice roars.

A probe pole clatters. The rope line snaps taut and then slackens as whoever’s holding it stumbles away from the collapsing lip. The bypass entrance becomes a rain of grit and small stones; their footing is suddenly as bad as you hoped—worse.

But you’re in the worse place now: in the void below, pinned and being pulled.

You can feel three options in your hands and teeth-level panic:
- Tear free immediately by abandoning whatever’s snagged (it’s your hip cloth and your boot/foot).
- Grab the dangling cable bundle brushing your shoulder in the dark and haul up toward the pocket.
- Find the embedded ladder rungs you can feel along the wall—two of them wobble when you slap for purchase.

The undertow keeps dragging, steady as a winch, toward the sump.

### Turn 160 [PLAYER]

I rasp, “Cut free—NOW,” and slash my snagged hip cloth off with the knife, then rip my foot out by abandoning the torn boot. I grab the dangling cable bundle with both hands and haul us up toward the pocket, keeping my partner tight on my belt and kicking for the wall to avoid the sump pull.

*Agent reasoning: Speed move: cut losses, get free fast. Boot is already compromised and snagged; abandoning it is quickest. Then use the cable bundle as a stable handhold to haul out before undertow pins us.*

### Turn 161 [GAME]

“Cut free—NOW.”

You go for the snag at your hip—and your hand closes on nothing. No knife. Your inventory’s been empty since the start, and there’s no handle where your fingers expect it. The undertow doesn’t care about the mistake; it keeps hauling.

So you do it the hard way.

You wedge two fingers under the rebar hook that’s caught your hip cloth and wrench your body sideways until fabric starts to tear. The cloth rips in a long, ugly strip. Pain flares at your hip where the rebar scraped skin through the tear, but the hook lets go.

Your foot is worse. The torn boot is pinned by a bent rebar prong; when you yank, it bites into the raw heel. You clamp your jaw and twist your ankle until the boot peels off with a suctioning *pop*, leaving your sock and bare heel exposed. The rebar rakes you again on the way out—warmth blooms in the water around your foot.

Free—mostly. Bleeding, but free.

A cable bundle brushes your shoulder in the dark: old conduit guts, slick with algae slime, still anchored somewhere above. You grab it with both hands. It’s thicker than you hoped and it *moves* under load—stretching, not breaking. You haul, hand-over-hand, and your partner stays locked to your belt, kicking at the wall to keep both of you from being spun into the sump’s pull.

The cable creaks against a bracket. Your shoulders burn. The current tries to peel you off like a label.

You gain about a body-length—enough that your head breaks into a pocket of trapped air under a low ledge. You can breathe, but it’s stale and tastes like wet copper. Your partner’s face surfaces beside yours, gasping silently, eyes huge.

Above, in the bypass, someone yells, closer than you want: “Hear that? Below!”

A pole tip clanks against concrete, probing for an edge. A flashlight snaps on for a second—its beam knifes down through the collapse dust and catches the cable you’re hanging from, vibrating.

They’ve got your line now: the cable is a tell.

The cable holds for the moment, but it’s not a ladder—every pull makes the bracket complain, and the undertow is still feeding the sump. Your bare, bleeding heel keeps slipping when you try to find wall purchase.

**Outcome:** you successfully tore free of the rebar snags and got you and your partner up into a small air pocket under a ledge by hauling the cable; you lost your boot and you’re bleeding from hip and heel; the pursuers have detected you below and are probing the drop.

I hiss to my partner, “Quiet. Stay on my belt.” Then I jerk the cable hard sideways to try to rip it free or snap it so it stops advertising us, and I feel along the ledge for a lateral seam/pipe mouth—anything that runs away from the drop—then pull us into it immediately, keeping my bleeding foot tucked up and off the current.

*Agent reasoning: They’ve spotted the cable; staying here gets us pinned. Fastest is to ditch the tell, move laterally into any culvert/maintenance seam from the air pocket, and keep my partner quiet and close.*

### Turn 164 [PLAYER]

I press my mouth to my partner’s ear. “Quiet. Stay on my belt.” I wrench the cable hard sideways to try to snap it free, then immediately sweep my hands along the ledge for a lateral seam or pipe mouth and shove us into the first opening that runs away from the drop, keeping my bleeding foot tucked up out of the current.

*Agent reasoning: The cable is giving away our position and the air pocket is a dead end if they start probing; fastest is to break line-of-sight and move laterally into any side run.*

### Turn 165 [GAME]

You press in close, lips at your partner’s ear. “Quiet. Stay on my belt.” They nod once—tiny, rigid—then clamp their jaw shut so hard you feel it through the strap.

You wrench the cable sideways.

For a heartbeat it feels like it might go—then the bracket above answers with a sharp *tink* and the whole bundle snaps taut like a live thing. The cable doesn’t break. Instead, the anchor point *shifts*, metal grinding on concrete, and the cable whips back and slaps the water. The vibration runs straight up the line.

Above you, a voice barks: “There—line moved!”

A hook-pole tip drops into the void and catches the cable. It *tugs*, testing. Not hauling yet—feeling you.

You don’t wait. You sweep the underside of the ledge with both hands. Concrete, slime, a jagged seam… then your fingers find a round mouth: a service pipe cut short, maybe a meter wide, its edge sharp with rust scale. It runs laterally—away from the drop.

You shove your shoulder into it and pull your partner after you by the belt. Your bleeding foot stays tucked, knee high, to keep the current from grabbing you again. The pipe’s lip scrapes your hip raw where the cloth tore; your partner stifles a gasp as their ribs grind the rim.

Inside, the water is shallower—still moving, but less violent. The undertow’s pull drops from a winch to a hand on your ankle.

Behind you, the cable jerks again—harder. The hook-pole man commits. “Got it! Something’s on—”

The bracket above finally gives up with a concrete *crack*. The cable tears free in a shower of grit and drops into the void, the hooked pole skittering and clanging as the man loses leverage.

“Shit—BACK!” someone yells, and boots scrape away from the collapsing edge.

Outcome: you successfully found a lateral pipe and got both of you into it; the cable didn’t snap at first—your wrenching signaled your position and prompted a hook-pole grab—but their tugging finished the job by ripping the bracket free, dropping the line and forcing them back from the lip.

In the pipe, you have maybe a few body-lengths of cover before it narrows or bends. You’re still bleeding, barefoot on one side, and the pipe air is thin and sour—but you’re no longer directly under the drop.

### Turn 166 [PLAYER]

I yank us deeper into the lateral pipe at a crouch, pushing for the first bend or junction. “No talking—count your breaths,” I whisper, then feel the wall for any maintenance hatch/valve recess we can duck into if they start probing the mouth.

*Agent reasoning: We bought a few seconds and broke their “line,” so the fastest win is to put distance and a bend between us and the drop, then deal with bleeding only if it’s disabling.*

### Turn 167 [GAME]

You pull the belt and your partner stumbles after you, both of you half-crouched in the pipe. The ceiling is low enough that your back scrapes rust nodules. The water here is shin-deep, sliding fast but not trying to steal you.

“No talking—count your breaths,” you whisper. Your partner’s shoulders bob once in agreement. You can hear them doing it: inhale, hold, exhale—too quick at first, then slowing as your pace forces a rhythm.

You push for distance. The pipe runs straight for about ten meters, then takes a hard left bend. Before the bend, your fingertips find a recessed rectangle in the right wall: an old access niche with a corroded quarter-turn valve and a bolted plate beneath it. The plate isn’t flush—one bolt head is missing, another is rounded off, and there’s a hairline gap you can get nails into. It’s not a “duck in and disappear” hatch, but it’s a place to press bodies into shadow if light comes down the mouth.

Behind you, from the direction of the drop, sound carries cleanly through the pipe: metal scraping concrete, then a voice, closer again.

“Pole’s in—sweep it! Don’t lean the lip!”

The hook-pole clacks against the pipe mouth. Then, a new sound: thin chain rattling, as if they’re lowering something with weight to keep it from drifting—maybe the pole, maybe a line.

A flashlight beam doesn’t reach you yet, but you see its flicker reflect off the wet curve of the pipe at the far end of the straightaway, pulsing as someone tries to angle it in.

Outcome: you got deeper to the first bend and found a valve recess/access niche you can use for partial cover; the pursuers are now actively probing the pipe mouth with a pole/line and trying to get light into the run. The threat is immediate detection if they get the beam past the bend or hook something inside the pipe.

### Turn 168 [PLAYER]

I shove my partner into the valve recess niche, flattening us into shadow for two breaths, then tug them forward and hustle us around the left bend. If the beam starts to reach, I slap a wet handprint smear across the pipe at the corner to dull reflections and keep moving without stopping.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to sweep light and a pole down the straight; best move is break line-of-sight and buy time by getting past the bend, using the niche only if we can’t make it.*

### Turn 169 [GAME]

You shove your partner into the valve recess niche and press in with them—two bodies forced into a space meant for one set of hands. Rust flakes bite your cheek. Your partner’s breath catches once; you clamp a palm over their sternum through cloth to steady the rise-and-fall. Two breaths. In. Out. In. Out.

The probing at the pipe mouth gets louder: hook-pole tip *tink-tink* on metal, then a wet scrape as it drags along the pipe’s bottom, testing for feet, belts, anything to snag.

A flashlight beam stabs down the straight run. It doesn’t hit you directly, but it *does* glance off the water skin and the pipe’s wet curve, sending a pale wash that creeps toward the bend.

You pull your partner out of the niche and hustle them forward. Around the left bend, you slap your wet hand against the corner and smear hard—algae, soot, and silt streaking into a dull matte. The next pulse of light hits that smeared patch and dies instead of blooming into a bright reflection.

You keep moving without stopping.

Around the bend, the pipe drops a few centimeters and the flow quickens; it tugs at your ankles, trying to pull you deeper. Your tucked, bleeding foot stays out of the current, but the hop-step makes you slower and louder. Your partner grips your belt with both hands now, knuckles white.

Behind you, the hook-pole clacks again—closer than you want. Then a voice, irritated, echoing down the pipe:

“Light’s not carrying—something’s on the corner. Get the chain in. Feel for the bend.”

Chain rattles, then a heavier *plunk* as they lower a weighted line into the mouth to drag and “read” the pipe.

Outcome: you successfully used the niche for a brief hide and got around the bend; your smear noticeably reduced the flashlight’s reach past the corner. Consequence: they’ve switched tactics—probing with a weighted chain/line that can snake around the bend and potentially snag you if you don’t open distance fast.

I grab my partner’s wrist and haul them into a jog-splash, pushing for any junction, grate, or vertical ladder stub—anything that breaks the pipe’s straight path. “When the chain hits, drop flat and let it slide over—don’t grab it,” I hiss, then keep moving hard to open distance before it rounds the bend.

I clamp my hand around my partner’s wrist and haul them into a jog-splash, driving forward for any junction, grate, or ladder stub. “When the chain hits, drop flat and let it slide over—don’t grab it,” I hiss, and keep pushing hard to open distance before it rounds the bend.

*Agent reasoning: The chain probe will round the bend and snag us if we stay in a straight run; best speed is to open distance and find a junction/ladder/grate to change levels or break line-of-probe, while prepping my partner not to panic-grab the chain.*

### Turn 173 [GAME]

You clamp your hand on your partner’s wrist and drag them into a sloppy jog. Water slaps loud against the pipe walls; every step throws a bright little sound that carries.

The pipe stays tight and featureless for another stretch—no grate, no side takeoff—just a slight wobble in the seam where two sections were welded decades apart. Then the floor pitches down a touch and the flow accelerates. Your partner nearly goes to a knee; you keep them up by the wrist and belt.

Ahead, the pipe finally breaks its monotony: a low, rectangular service throat on the right, half blocked by a bent grille. It’s not a full manway—more like a cable/inspection takeoff—but it’s a hard edge and a change in geometry. Past it, the main pipe continues and you can hear a different sound layered under the water: a hollow, vertical “breathing” draft, like air moving in a shaft.

Behind you, the chain arrives.

Not the weight first—the *feel* of it: a metallic rasping that suddenly becomes loud as it scrapes around the bend. The first links skitter along the pipe bottom, then hop as the weight bumps the corner and swings through. It’s moving fast, dragged from behind with intent.

Your warning lands just in time. Your partner drops flat in panic—too slow by a fraction. The chain slides over their back, but one link catches on their pack strap or belt loop and yanks hard. They make a sharp, involuntary sound.

Down the pipe, a voice barks, immediate and satisfied: “Got something! Haul!”

The chain goes taut. Your partner is now being pulled backward along the slick pipe floor toward the bend, heels scraping, water spraying. You’re still holding their wrist, and the pull transmits into your shoulder—if you keep your grip, you’ll be dragged too.

The service throat with the bent grille is three to four body-lengths ahead on your right. The vertical draft sound is beyond that, further down the main run.

Threat is clear: the pursuers have hooked your partner with the chain and are actively hauling; if you don’t break the snag or change the geometry fast, they’ll reel you back to the bend and into their reach.

### Turn 174 [PLAYER]

“Knife it off—NOW!” I bark, yanking them toward the right-side service throat and ramming their caught strap/hip against the bent grille to try to snag the chain on the metal and peel it free, then shove them headfirst into the throat and follow in tight.

*Agent reasoning: Fastest way is break the snag and change direction into the side throat; if I get dragged, we’re done. I’ll use the bent grille as a hard edge to shear the chain off their strap.*

### Turn 175 [GAME]

Your shout is useless on the “knife it off” part—neither of you has a blade. But the rest of the move is pure engineer’s spite: use the geometry.

You yank them sideways toward the right-side service throat and slam their hip/strap hard into the bent grille. The chain, already under tension, bites into the grille’s deformed bars with a shriek of metal. For a half-second it holds—then you drive again, grinding the caught link deeper into the kinked steel.

The pull from behind spikes. Your partner’s whole body jerks backward; your grip on their wrist nearly tears free. The grille flexes, protesting, and then one of its corroded fasteners gives with a sharp *ping*. The grille twists just enough to trap the chain link like a hook in a fish’s mouth.

Outcome: the chain is no longer pulling your partner cleanly—it’s snagged on the grille.

Consequence: the pursuers feel the change immediately.

From behind: “It hung—keep hauling! Don’t let it slack!”

The chain goes taut-tighter. The grille starts to peel out of its seat, screeching as rusted metal tears. If it rips free entirely, it’ll come with the chain… and you and your partner are right on top of it.

You don’t wait. You shove your partner headfirst into the service throat. It’s a brutal squeeze: shoulders scraping, cables brushing their face, the inside stinking of old insulation and stagnant air. You follow in tight, twisting sideways to fit.

As you disappear into the throat, the main pipe behind you erupts with a tearing sound—metal giving way under the haul. The grille lurches, half-detached, still holding the chain link… for now. The opening you’re in is narrow enough that a body can’t rush it at speed, but a hooked pole or the chain itself can still be fed into it.

You are both in the right-side service throat, wedged among cable runs, with the chain snag-point at the mouth actively being ripped apart by force from the far side.

### Turn 176 [PLAYER]

I shove my partner deeper down the throat toward that draft, then rip at the nearest loose cable bundle and wad it into the mouth behind us as a snag/jam. “Keep crawling—don’t look back,” I hiss, and shoulder-forward crawl hard until we hit a turn or a vertical stub.

*Agent reasoning: We need to break line-of-pull fast before they rip the grille and feed the chain into this throat; push deeper to a vertical/turn and use the cable run as an improvised jam if needed.*

### Turn 177 [GAME]

You shove your partner deeper into the throat. The draft is real in here—cooler, less wet—pulling along the cable run like a slow inhale. The space stays miserably tight: elbows in silt, cheek against gritty concrete, cables brushing your ear like drowned vines.

You grab the nearest slack bundle—old comms line and a thicker, tar-stiff power lead—and rip. The outer sheath tears with a dull *pop*, copper strands flashing. You wad the whole mess into the mouth behind you, jamming it between the throat lip and the half-torn grille.

It works—briefly.

The next haul from behind turns the jam into a winch. The cable bundle cinches hard, biting into the grille and the throat edge. You hear insulation squeal, then a sharp crack as a conductor snaps. A shower of tiny blue-white sparks spits in the pipe mouth, hissing where they hit wet metal. The smell of burnt plastic floods the throat.

Your partner flinches but keeps crawling when you hiss at them. You shoulder-forward after them, pushing through the constriction until the throat kinks left around a concrete rib. Past the bend, the draft strengthens and the sound changes: not water anymore—open air space somewhere ahead.

Behind you, the pursuers reach the mouth. A voice, close now, distorted by the pipe: “They’re in the takeoff—feed the hook in!”

Something metallic clacks against the throat lip. A hooked pole probes in, scraping. It catches your cable wad and yanks; the jam holds for a second, then starts to unravel under steady pulling.

You hit the bend and gain a few body-lengths of concealment, but the threat is immediate and specific: a hook-pole is being worked into the throat to snag ankles or packs, and your improvised cable jam is failing under tension and tearing live conductors that are now intermittently sparking at the mouth.

Just past the bend, as your light smears across the wall, you see a faded municipal stencil under algae bloom—your old department code, half-obscured—tagging a narrow, dry belly-crawl that rises above the cable run. It skirts away from the throat’s main line, toward that cleaner air draft.

### Turn 178 [PLAYER]

“Bypass—up, now.” I shove my partner into the dry belly-crawl first, then wriggle in after them, kicking a last loop of slack cable down behind us to foul the hook and crawling hard toward the stronger draft.

*Agent reasoning: They’re probing with a hook and my cable jam won’t last; the bypass is higher/drier and likely too tight for them to follow quickly. Fastest is to get us into that belly-crawl and keep moving toward air.*

### Turn 179 [GAME]

You ram your partner upward into the dry belly-crawl bypass. The angle is just steep enough that you have to commit—knees and elbows scraping on gritty concrete that hasn’t seen standing water in a long time. The air immediately shifts: cooler, cleaner, with that telltale “leaking” freshness that doesn’t belong down here.

You wriggle in after them and, as you go, you hook a boot on a slack loop of cable and kick it down into the throat below.

Outcome: the loop drops right onto the probing hook-pole tip as it snakes around the bend. You hear a satisfying *clank* and then a sharp jerk as the pole catches cable instead of flesh.

A man grunts—close, frustrated. “It’s fouled—pull it back!”

They tug. The cable loop tightens around the hook’s crook and cinches. For a second, you’ve bought friction and confusion.

Consequence: they don’t stop. They change tactics.

“Then cut the damned cable,” another voice says, and you hear wet boots repositioning, metal scraping as someone braces in the main pipe. Something hard strikes—maybe a chisel or the butt of a tool—followed by a snapping twang as copper strands give way. The fouled loop starts to slide free.

You and your partner crawl hard. The bypass narrows to a true belly-squeeze: ribs dragging, breath loud in your own ears. Ahead, the draft strengthens into a steady pull, and with it comes a thin, high hum—live infrastructure nearby, not just open air. Your partner’s breathing turns ragged, but they keep moving.

After about two body-lengths, the bypass reaches a short vertical stub—an old service riser throat with dry rungs set into the concrete. Above it: a hatch outline, newer bolts catching your light, and at the seam a faint feather of *clean air* leaking down like a promise.

Below and behind, the hook-pole scrapes again—closer now, no longer fouled. They’re feeding it into the bypass entrance and working it upward, trying to snag a leg at the riser.

Threat is immediate: you’re at a vertical riser with a bolted hatch above; pursuers are actively probing into the bypass with a hook-pole and closing the distance.

### Turn 180 [PLAYER]

“Up the rungs—move!” I boost my partner into the riser, then climb right after, planting a boot on the top rung to keep low. I slam my heel down toward the shaft mouth to kick the hook back if it reaches, then start wrenching at the hatch bolts with my hands, feeling for anything already loose.

*Agent reasoning: Fastest exit is the hatch; we can’t fight a hook-pole in a crawlspace. Get partner up first, then I’ll block the riser and force entry.*

### Turn 181 [GAME]

You boost your partner into the riser. They get both hands on the dry rungs and climb fast, boots scraping concrete. You follow immediately, keeping low under them, one knee jammed against the wall for leverage.

The hook arrives a heartbeat later. You hear it before you see it—metal on concrete, a deliberate scrape—then the curved tip snakes up into the riser mouth, fishing.

You slam your heel down.

Outcome: you connect. Your boot catches the hook’s crook and drives it back out of the riser with a hollow *clang*. The pole whips away and bangs the throat wall below. Someone curses—short and sharp.

Consequence: they don’t give you space; they change the angle. The pole comes back, higher, thrusting rather than probing, trying to wedge past your boot and pin your ankle against the rung.

Above, you reach the hatch. Up close, it’s worse than you hoped: new bolts, hex heads, seated in fresh sealant that still looks slightly glossy in your light. Your fingers find no looseness—everything is torqued down. You manage to peel a thin ribbon of sealant with your nails, but the bolt itself doesn’t budge.

A voice echoes up the riser now, right under you: “They’re on the hatch—hold ‘em! Get the chain up here!”

Metal rattles below—someone feeding something heavy into the throat. The hook-pole jabs again, and this time the tip catches the underside of the lowest rung and levers, trying to lift your boot off its brace point.

Your partner reaches the hatch seam and sucks in the clean air leaking through, then looks down at you—eyes wide, waiting for it to give.

Threat is immediate and specific: the hatch is sealed with new hardware you can’t loosen by hand, and the pursuers are preparing to bring the chain up to the riser while the hook-pole works to dislodge your brace and snag you or your partner’s legs. If they get the chain into the riser, they can haul you down or pin you against the shaft wall.

### Turn 182 [PLAYER]

“Stomp the hatch edge—hard—like you mean to cave it in!” I bark up at my partner, then wedge my boot and shin across the rung to pin the hook-pole in the throat. With my free hand I yank another loose cable loop and drop it straight down the riser to snare the chain when it comes, then drive my shoulder up into the hatch from below, trying to pop the seal.

*Agent reasoning: Bolts won’t hand-turn; fastest is brute force—use body weight to shear seal/strip bolts or pop the hatch. Also need to deny the riser: if chain comes up, we’re done. I’ll have partner stomp/pry from above while I jam the hook and drop something to foul the shaft.*

### Turn 183 [GAME]

Your partner plants both boots on the hatch edge and stomps—once, twice—hard enough to make the riser ring like a bell. The hatch doesn’t cave, but the sealant at one corner spider-cracks with a dry *tick*, and a stronger tongue of clean air pushes through the seam.

Below, you wedge your boot and shin across the rung and catch the hook-pole on the upswing. Outcome: you pin it for a moment—metal trapped between your shin and the rung. The man on the other end yanks, but all he gets is a grinding squeal and a jolt that runs up your leg.

Consequence: the leverage is brutal. The hook’s crook bites and slips; it scrapes your boot sole and then skates across your shin. Pain flares hot and immediate—skin torn through whatever thin fabric you’ve got left. You keep it from getting past, but you can’t hold it there without paying for it.

You reach one-handed and rip a loose cable loop from the wall run—stiff, half-cured with tar—and drop it straight down the riser.

It falls right into the darkness as the chain arrives.

A heavy length of chain clatters up from below, fed by unseen hands. The cable loop catches it—partly. Outcome: the chain snags, twists, and momentarily binds against the riser wall with the cable loop wrapped around a link. It slows their feed and turns their pull into a jerky, inefficient tug.

“Caught—something caught!” someone barks under you. “Cut it—CUT IT!”

You drive your shoulder up into the hatch from below, timing it with your partner’s stomps. The corner with the cracked sealant gives a fraction—enough that a thin line of light appears at the seam, a pale blade. The hatch shifts maybe a finger-width, then stops dead against the bolts. Your shoulder impact buys you *movement* but not an opening.

Above, your partner’s hands find the gap and pry—fingertips whitening—trying to peel the hatch up against the bolt tension. Their breath is loud in the confined shaft.

Below, the chain jerks again, harder. The cable loop starts to saw against a link; you hear strands popping one by one. The hook-pole—freed from your pin by sheer force—stabs upward again, now aiming for your ankle joint where your boot meets the rung.

Threat, clear: you’ve cracked the seal and shifted the hatch slightly, but it’s still locked by new bolts. The pursuers are cutting or tearing through your cable snare and are about to get a chain properly into the riser; the hook-pole is actively trying to snag your ankle to pull you down or hold you in place while they haul.

### Turn 184 [PLAYER]

I snap my knee up to dodge the hook, then stomp straight down on the hook tip to pin it and shove it sideways off the rung. “Stop prying—LISTEN: feel the seam, find the corner that cracked—drive your fingers in and HOLD it open!” I jam two fingers into the cracked corner seam myself and saw them along to widen it, then yell down the shaft, “Got a cutter? You cut that cable, I cut your throat!”

*Agent reasoning: Hatch won’t open without tools; fastest is to force a gap big enough for fingers/air, then jam it so it can’t reseat while we shift to another exit path. Also need to stop the hook from catching my ankle right now.*

### Turn 185 [GAME]

You snap your knee up as the hook darts for your ankle. The tip whistles past the rung edge and nicks nothing but air.

You stomp straight down on it—hard. Outcome: you pin the hook tip against the concrete lip of the riser mouth and grind it sideways. The pole flexes; the man below loses control for a beat. The hook scrapes off the rung edge and drops, clanging down the throat.

“—Shit!” the hook-man barks, and you hear him stumble back a step in the wet below.

Your partner stops prying blindly and does what you said: they find the corner where the sealant cracked. They jam fingers in and *hold*—white knuckles, wrists trembling. The hatch seam opens another sliver under their grip. Clean air pours harder now, cold and pressurized enough to make the hair on your forearms lift.

You jam two fingers into the cracked corner yourself and saw them along the seam.

Outcome: the sealant peels and tears in a ragged strip. Your fingers come back slick—part sealant, part blood where the hatch edge bites. The gap widens to maybe two finger-widths along a short run.

Consequence: the hatch still doesn’t lift. The bolts are still doing their job. What you’ve made is a *vent* and a *purchase point*, not an exit.

Your threat down the shaft—“Got a cutter?”—gets an immediate answer, not the one you want.

A voice below, calm and close: “You don’t have a throat to cut from up there.”

Then: a harsh metallic *snip-snip* as someone starts cutting at the cable loop binding the chain. The chain feed resumes, link by link, scraping up concrete. You feel the vibration through the rungs as it climbs.

Worse: they change the hook’s role. Instead of fishing for your ankle, the hook-man starts hammering the pole upward like a battering ram, striking the riser wall and rungs to rattle you loose while the chain comes up to grab.

Threat is now twofold and immediate:
1) The chain is coming up fast—once they get a loop over a rung or around a leg, they can haul you down or pin you in place.
2) The hatch seam is open only a couple finger-widths—enough for air and fingers, not enough for a body—and the sharp edge is already cutting you as you work it.

### Turn 186 [PLAYER]

“Brace—don’t let that seam close.” I climb down one rung, wrap my forearm through a rung, and stomp/kick the rising chain to knock it off-line and jam it between rung and wall; then I yank the hook-pole up as it strikes, trying to steal it and wedge it crosswise in the shaft as a blocker. “Which side’s hinged?” I snap to my partner, “Find the hinge—tear the seal there!”

*Agent reasoning: Hatch won’t open by force; bolts are the lock. Fastest is to disable the chain and buy seconds by dropping weight, then use the cracked seam as a guide to find a latch/bolt access or hinge side; if no tool, use the chain itself as a lever/trip.*

### Turn 187 [GAME]

“Brace—don’t let that seam close.” Your partner locks both hands in the cracked corner and leans their weight into it, forearms shaking. The seam stays open—barely—clean air hissing past their fingers.

You drop one rung, hook your forearm through the rung to anchor yourself, and kick at the chain as it rises.

Outcome: your boot catches the chain on an upswing and knocks it off-line. It slaps hard into the riser wall and rides up crooked. For a second it *does* start to wedge between rung and concrete.

Consequence: chain doesn’t behave like cable. The next pull from below yanks it tight; it bites, then slips. It rips past your boot and smashes your shin on the way by—painful, immediate, and it steals your balance for a heartbeat. The chain keeps coming.

The hook-pole starts hammering upward again. You time it and grab—yanking as it strikes.

Outcome: you get hands on the pole and haul it up a foot, maybe two, before the man below throws his weight into it. The pole jerks, twists, and the hook end whips inside the shaft. It doesn’t come free.

Consequence: the hook catches your forearm that’s threaded through the rung—just a glancing snag, but enough to rake skin and pin you awkwardly for a moment. You wrench away, but you’ve just shown them exactly where to aim.

Below, someone barks, “Chain’s up—get it over his arm!”

The chain rises to your level, and a loop swings toward the rung where your forearm is anchored. They’re trying to lasso the rung and cinch you in place.

Up top you snap, “Which side’s hinged?”

Your partner shifts their head, feeling along the seam with fingertips. “Right—hinge right!” they gasp, then immediately start tearing at the sealant along that side. They manage to peel another short strip, widening the gap along the hinge edge—but the hinge itself holds firm, metal-on-metal.

Immediate threat: the chain is now at your rung height and they’re actively trying to get a loop over the rung/your trapped forearm to cinch and haul you down. The hook-pole is still being driven upward, now targeting your anchor point. The hatch is *not* opening yet—only the seal is failing along the hinge side.

### Turn 188 [PLAYER]

I yank my forearm out of the rung and climb up a half-step, then hook the chain loop with my boot and whip it sideways to catch on a rung and wedge. “Now—lift on the LEFT, not the hinge—use the gap and shove!” I slam my shoulder up under the left edge while they hold the seam open.

*Agent reasoning: I’m about to get lassoed; fastest is to free my arm and redirect the chain to jam it, buying seconds for the hatch to pop on the non-hinge side.*

### Turn 189 [GAME]

You rip your forearm free of the rung—skin tears where the hook grazed you, but you’re loose—and climb up half a step, getting your weight higher.

The chain loop swings up again. You catch it with the inside edge of your boot and whip it sideways.

Outcome: the loop snaps across and *does* catch on a rung—half a wrap—then wedges between the rung and the wall for a heartbeat. The pull from below goes from smooth to a hard, choking *jerk*.

Consequence: the chain doesn’t stop; it loads. The rung you used becomes the fulcrum. Concrete dust spits from the wall where the chain bites. Your boot gets yanked with it—your ankle torques painfully, and you have to tear your foot free before it gets trapped between chain and rung. The chain grinds, then pops free with a metallic shriek and continues upward.

You shout, “Now—lift on the LEFT, not the hinge—use the gap and shove!”

Your partner shifts their grip to the left edge, fingers jammed into the ragged seam, and heaves. You slam your shoulder up under the left edge at the same time.

Outcome: the hatch lifts—just enough to *clack* against bolt shanks. You gain a narrow crescent opening on the left side, maybe the width of two knuckles at its widest point. Clean air gushes out in a steady stream, strong enough to flutter loose grit down the shaft.

Consequence: the bolts are still seated. You’ve turned the hatch into a partially lifted, bolt-stopped lid—an opening that can take fingers, maybe a thin tool, but not a head or shoulder. And forcing it like this makes noise: the bolt metal squeals against the hatch plate, loud and sharp.

Below, the response is immediate and practical. The calm voice barks, “They’ve got purchase—CUT THE BOLTS.”

You hear splashing footsteps reposition. Then a new sound joins the chain’s scrape: a battery grinder or saw waking up—high, angry whine—somewhere just below the riser mouth, angled up toward the bolts you can’t see from beneath.

The chain keeps climbing too, now used as a stabilizer: they’re feeding it up to brace whoever’s bringing the cutter into position.

Threat, clear: you’ve created a small opening but not an exit; the pursuers are about to put a cutter on the bolts from below. If they cut the wrong thing (or deliberately cut the hatch edge), the hatch can drop or shift suddenly—your partner’s fingers are in the seam, and your shoulder is under the left edge. If the cutter bites metal near you, you’re one slip away from losing fingers or taking the full hatch edge to the neck/shoulder.

### Turn 190 [PLAYER]

“Fingers OUT—let it drop!” I pull my shoulder back and let the hatch slam down onto the bolts, then jam my boot against the seam to keep a hairline gap. I snake my hand up through the crescent opening and feel for the bolt heads/backs—anything I can spin, shear, or yank loose from the top side—while barking down the shaft, “Cut it and you’ll wear this hatch!”

*Agent reasoning: Grinder means we’re out of time; we need to deny them line-of-sight to the bolts and convert this gap into an exit fast. Best play: drop the hatch to protect fingers, then use the gap to slip a tool/hand through and release from above or get into the space beyond.*

### Turn 191 [GAME]

“Fingers OUT—let it drop!”

Your partner yanks their hands clear just in time. You pull your shoulder back and the hatch drops—*clang*—onto the bolt shanks. The impact stings your ears and sends a puff of clean, cold air down the riser like a breath forced through teeth.

You jam your boot against the seam, not to hold it open—just to keep it from sealing flush. You get a hairline gap: enough to keep air leaking, not enough to see through.

You snake your hand up through the crescent opening you’d made earlier—only now it’s mostly gone. Your fingers find the underside of the hatch plate and the bolt ends: smooth, round shanks with very little to grab. These aren’t old hex heads you can spin; they feel like carriage bolts or security bolts—domed on top, with the nut side likely *above* the hatch in whatever clean space is feeding that air.

You probe, frantic and precise: you do find one thing—wire. A short length of thin steel safety wire or tie, looped through a tab near one bolt, probably meant to keep something from vibrating loose. You can hook it with a finger and pull it taut, but it won’t shear by hand.

Below, your bark gets an answer—snarled laughter and then a hard, practical repositioning.

“Back off the mouth!” someone shouts. The grinder whine shifts angle, farther down the shaft—safer from the hatch’s drop line. They’re not cutting blind at the seam anymore.

Then the chain changes purpose again: instead of rising, it goes taut and *stops*, braced. A second later the hook-pole slams upward—not at your ankle now, but at the hatch edge itself. They’re trying to rattle your boot out of the seam and force the hatch to sit flush so you lose even that hairline gap and any reach.

You feel the hatch shudder with each strike. Your boot vibrates against metal; if it slips, the seam closes and your hand is trapped against a domed bolt end with nowhere to withdraw fast.

And under all of it—subtle but real—you catch movement off to the side in a flooded culvert slit: a snorkel mask lens glints once, then disappears. Water ripples where someone quietly shifts position.

Threats now:
- Hook-pole impacts can knock your boot free and slam the hatch shut on your hand.
- The grinder is repositioning for a safer cut—likely the chain, or the hinge, or something that makes the hatch fail in a way you can’t control.
- Someone nearby is tracking the situation from cover, close enough to report or intervene.

### Turn 192 [PLAYER]

I yank my hand back fast and pull my boot off the seam before the next shudder can bite. I hiss to my partner, “Down—culvert slit, now,” then pivot and drop toward the flooded side channel, calling low, “Hey—mask. You want to live, point me to the nearest bypass out of here.”

*Agent reasoning: I can’t win a bolt-cutting contest from below. Fastest path is disengage, use the culvert watcher as a new variable—either ally or exit—and avoid getting my hand trapped.*

### Turn 193 [GAME]

You rip your hand back in time—your knuckles scrape the bolt ends but nothing catches. You pull your boot off the seam.

The hatch slams fully flush on the next hook-pole strike. The clean-air hiss stops like someone pinched a tube. Your partner, hearing you, doesn’t argue—just drops a rung hard, then another, boots clanging as they go.

You pivot and drop toward the flooded side channel.

Outcome: you make the drop, but it’s ugly. Your wet boot sole skates on slime at the lip; you catch yourself with one hand on a corroded ladder staple and swing down into thigh-deep water with a splash you can’t hide.

Consequence: something tugs your leg immediately—loose cable or rebar snag under the surface. It doesn’t hold you fast, but it steals a second as you wrench free, and that second is loud.

You call low, “Hey—mask. You want to live, point me to the nearest bypass out of here.”

The glint you saw resolves: a diver’s mask just above the waterline in the culvert slit. Not one of the hook-pole crew—this one’s been waiting. A Tidewarden-style rig: dark hood, compact tank, quiet breathing.

They don’t answer your bargain. They act.

A hand flicks out of the slit and a thin line snakes across the water—weighted. It hits and starts to sink toward your shins, aiming to foul your legs.

At the same moment, above you in the riser, the chain goes slack—then drops. Not free-falling; fed fast. It splashes into the channel behind you, cutting off the path back under the shaft like a metal curtain.

From the shaft mouth, the pursuit leader shouts down: “There. Cornered. Don’t spear—take her breathing.”

Your partner hits the water a beat later, splashing into the channel on your left. They see the line and immediately jerk back, but the weighted cord is already drifting toward both of you with the current.

Clear threats:
- The masked diver is actively trying to entangle your legs with a weighted line from the culvert slit.
- The chain is being used to block the route back and to pen you in the side channel.
- The team above is closing for a non-lethal capture; you can hear them moving along the rim and preparing to come down.

### Turn 194 [PLAYER]

I slash down through the water with my knife at the weighted line as it sinks, then grab the weight and fling it back toward the slit to foul the diver instead. “Go—over the chain, left wall!” I hiss to my partner, and I lunge into the culvert slit right after the thrown weight, shoulder-first, trying to jam the diver in place and force a passage past them.

*Agent reasoning: Entanglement is the immediate kill/capture condition; cut/avoid the line first, then take the only forward exit—the culvert slit—before the team climbs down.*

### Turn 195 [GAME]

Your knife comes out low and fast, slashing down through the murk where the line is sinking.

Outcome: you hit *something*—the cord twangs and goes slack in your hand. The cut isn’t clean; it’s a frayed break, but it’s broken enough that the weight stops tracking your legs.

You grab the weight—cold metal, oblong—and whip it back toward the culvert slit.

Outcome: the throw lands. It smacks the concrete lip with a sharp *clack* and drops into the slit’s mouth, dragging a tail of line after it.

Consequence: it doesn’t “foul” the diver neatly. The diver’s hand darts out and *catches the line*, using it like a handle. You’ve given them something to pull with.

“Go—over the chain, left wall!” you hiss.

Your partner moves—fast, ugly scramble—hands on the left wall, trying to get around the hanging chain curtain where it’s splashing and bouncing in the channel. They get a shoulder over it, then a hip, water slapping loud.

You lunge shoulder-first into the culvert slit right behind the weight.

Outcome: you collide with the diver hard. Your shoulder hits their chest/rig; their mask knocks the wall with a plastic crack. For a half second you have them pinned in the narrow throat.

Immediate consequence: they *don’t* let go. They cinch the remaining line around your forearm with a practiced twist and shove back with their fins braced deeper in the slit. The space is too tight for leverage; it turns into a wedged wrestling match, both of you jammed.

They hiss through their regulator, voice distorted: “Not through.”

Then they do the Tidewarden thing—practical capture. A gloved thumb hooks under your jawline and drives your face sideways toward the wall-water seam, trying to force your mouth/nose under and make you reflexively break position.

Above and behind, the pursuit team reacts to the splash and chain movement. Boots hit rungs—someone is coming down the riser now, fast. A light beam knifes across the channel mouth, searching for your partner and then snapping to you at the slit.

Threats, concrete:
- Your forearm is partially looped by the diver’s line; if they pull, you’ll be pinned or dragged deeper into the slit.
- The diver is actively trying to dunk you to break your resistance.
- A pursuer is descending with a light; seconds from reaching the channel, they can grab you from behind while you’re wedged.

### Turn 196 [PLAYER]

I tuck my chin hard to deny the dunk, then saw my knife across the line cinched on my forearm until it parts. As it loosens, I drive my thumb into the edge of their mask/regulator seal and wrench it sideways to flood their mouthpiece, then shove off the wall and slip past them into the slit, calling back to my partner, “Don’t stop—keep moving!”

*Agent reasoning: I’m wedged and about to get grabbed from behind; fastest escape is to break the loop, disable the diver’s breathing, and slip past before the climber reaches me.*

### Turn 197 [GAME]

You tuck your chin and twist your shoulder, denying them the easy dunk. Your jaw grinds against your own collarbone, but your face stays out of the waterline.

Your knife hand works by feel. You saw across the cinched cord on your forearm—wet line, tough fibers—and on the third hard pull it finally gives. The tension snaps free with a sting, leaving a shallow burn around your skin where it bit.

The diver reacts instantly to the loss of control: they surge forward to re-hook you, but the slit is too tight. Their elbow jams against the concrete and they lose half a beat.

You take that beat and jam your thumb into the edge of their mask/regulator seal and wrench.

Outcome: you don’t rip the whole rig off—the straps hold—but you break the seal enough to make it fail. Water floods in around the mouthpiece area. The diver coughs through the regulator, a choking, panicked stutter, and their hands fly to their face to reseat the mask.

That gives you the gap you needed. You shove off the wall, shoulder and hip scraping concrete, and squeeze past them deeper into the culvert slit.

Consequence: the passage is narrower than it looked from outside. You get through, but it costs you skin—your upper arm and ribs rasp hard on grit and barnacled concrete. Your breath comes hot and sharp.

Behind you, the diver—half-blinded, re-sealing—lashes out and grabs at your ankle. Their glove catches your boot heel for a moment, then slips off as you kick free.

Above the channel mouth, the descending pursuer’s light snaps directly into the slit. You hear them shout, close now: “She’s in the culvert—after her!”

Your partner, in the open water, answers your call by moving—scrambling along the left wall, splashing away into the darker run beyond the chain curtain. You can hear them, but you can’t see them anymore.

New, immediate threat: you are now in a tight culvert with an impaired but still mobile diver behind you, and at least one pursuer about to enter from the channel mouth with a light. If they commit into the slit, you’ll be trapped between them in a space too narrow to turn and fight clean.

### Turn 198 [PLAYER]

I kick off hard and crawl-sprint deeper, then wedge my waterlogged map case crosswise in the slit behind me as a jam. “Enjoy the choke point,” I mutter, and keep moving until I hit the first bend or junction—then I pause just long enough to listen for which side has flow/air.

*Agent reasoning: I’m about to get pinched in a one-way crawl; fastest is to block pursuit behind me and gain distance toward any junction or grate.*

### Turn 199 [GAME]

You kick off and crawl-sprint—forearms and knees pumping in a tight, wet chute. The slit narrows and widens in pulses, concrete scraping your shoulders; the water is only a few inches deep here, but it drags at you like glue.

You reach back for the jam and realize the problem immediately: you don’t have a map case to wedge.

Your maps are loose, waterlogged sheets—no rigid tube, no hard shell. You can’t cross-brace the culvert with paper. You can try to stuff them in as a wad, but they’ll just pulp and wash.

You do it anyway—shoving a fistful of soggy sheets and their straps into a hairline constriction where the culvert pinches.

Outcome: it makes a *momentary* snag. The paper catches on aggregate and old cable staples and the water eddies.

Immediate consequence: behind you, you hear the diver’s hands slapping forward, then the harsh rasp of someone else entering the slit—boots scraping, not fins. The pursuer with the light commits into the mouth, and the beam turns the culvert into a white tunnel.

They hit your paper-wad and tear straight through it with a wet ripping sound.

A voice—close, male, breathy with effort: “She’s ahead. Keep pressure.”

The diver you flooded is coughing and re-seating their mask; you hear the regulator chatter, but they’re still moving, using the pursuer’s light as their guide.

You keep moving until the first bend: a rightward kink where the culvert turns and the water changes sound.

You pause and listen.

- To the right (around the bend): a faint warm draft, dry on your cheek, and a higher-pitched hiss like air moving through a smaller throat. The water noise dulls.
- Behind you: splashing, scraping, and the light beam starting to strobe across the bend as they round it.

Threat, clear: they are in the slit with you and closing. The bend is your only break in line-of-sight, and you have maybe a few seconds before the light hits your back again.

### Turn 200 [PLAYER]

I hug the right wall and take the kink hard, killing my profile from their light, then jam my knife into the nearest seam/soft mortar where the warm draft’s strongest and pry for a hidden grate or maintenance slot. If it gives at all, I squeeze through and keep crawling without looking back.

*Agent reasoning: They’re seconds behind; the warm draft/hiss means a smaller air path—likely a service crawl or vent that breaks pursuit. No time to fight.*

### Turn 201 [GAME]

You take the kink tight, shoulder grinding the right wall, keeping your body flat so their beam has less to catch. For a second the light flares on the wet curve behind you—then it’s gone as the bend eats it.

You find the warmest thread of air by feel: a hairline seam where two pours meet, gritty mortar softened by salt. You jam the knife tip in and pry.

Outcome: it gives—barely. Not a hidden door, not a clean slot. A thin concrete skim pops with a dry *tick* and flakes away, revealing a rusted cable takeoff: a narrow oval opening with a bent grille behind it, half-choked with old wire sheath and algae-dried silt.

You lever again. The grille shifts with a tortured squeal and one side tears loose, leaving a jagged gap *just* big enough if you go sideways and exhale.

Consequence: the squeal carries. Behind you, the pursuer’s voice snaps sharp, closer than you want: “Right wall—she’s working something!”

The light slashes around the bend, jittering as they crawl. It catches your knife hand and the fresh pale scrape where you broke the skim.

You don’t look back. You shove your shoulder into the gap.

Outcome: you get through, but it bites you. The torn grille rakes your upper arm and ribs; you feel warm wetness immediately—blood in thin lines. Your hip sticks for a heartbeat on a jagged edge, then you wrench free and spill into a narrower service throat that angles upward. The air is drier here and smells of old insulation and copper.

Immediate threat: behind you, metal shrieks as the pursuer grabs the torn grille and yanks. It flexes wider under force. A hand comes through, fingers clawing for purchase, and the beam spears into the service throat, washing the tight space ahead of you in harsh white.

The diver—still coughing—arrives at the bend and barks through their regulator, muffled: “Don’t let her climb. Pin her in the takeoff.”

You are in the maintenance slot and moving, but they’ve found it and they’re forcing the opening wider. If they get shoulders through, you’ll be trapped in a tube too tight to turn and fight—caught from behind with nowhere to sidestep.

### Turn 202 [PLAYER]

I keep crawling uphill and, without stopping, yank at any loose cable/strap in the service throat to tangle the opening; then I kick back hard at the torn grille supports to bend them inward and snag the pursuer’s reaching arm. “Wrong tunnel,” I growl, and push for the next hatch/branch—anything that breaks line-of-sight.

*Agent reasoning: They’ve got the opening and a light—if they get in, I’m done. Fastest is to collapse/deny the choke point and keep climbing toward air.*

### Turn 203 [GAME]

You keep crawling uphill, palms sliding over dust-caked insulation and slick old sheath. There’s loose cable here—dead runs someone cut long ago. You hook two fingers under a loop and yank as you go.

Outcome: it pulls free in a snarled bundle and whips back toward the torn opening. It doesn’t “net” the gap, but it does drape across it and catch on the jagged grille edge.

Then you kick back—hard—boot heel smashing into the torn grille supports.

Outcome: you don’t fold the whole thing shut, but you *do* bend a support inward. The pursuer’s reaching arm is still through, and the bent metal bites down across their forearm with a dull, meaty *clank*.

He yells—close, sudden pain: “AH—fuck! My arm!”

His light jerks, beam skittering wildly along the service throat ceiling, then smearing across your back as he tries to pull away. The cable bundle you yanked tightens with his movement and snags around his wrist and the light’s lanyard.

Consequence: it buys you seconds, not safety. You hear him wrenching, breath turning ragged, and the metal squeals as he forces the grille back the other way. He’s strong, and leverage favors him at the mouth.

Behind him, the diver’s muffled voice through the regulator: “Cut it—cut the cable! Get in!”

A blade scrapes on metal. Sparks spit briefly at the opening, tiny bright flecks in the beam.

You push uphill toward anything that breaks sight. The throat rises into a cramped junction where the takeoff meets a vertical riser—dry rungs set into the concrete, leading up into darkness. Above, you can smell *cleaner* air leaking—faintly sweet, like filtered intake.

But the threat is immediate and clear: the pursuer is cutting his arm free and widening the entry. Once he’s through, he’ll have you in a straight, tight run with a light and a knife—close enough to grab your ankle.

### Turn 204 [PLAYER]

I grab the dry rungs and climb hard, three rungs at a time, keeping my knife clenched in my teeth. As soon as I’m a body-length up, I kick loose grit and any dangling cable down the shaft to rain into their face and light, then keep climbing toward that cleaner-air leak without stopping.

*Agent reasoning: Vertical riser breaks line-of-sight and gets me out of the tube where they can ankle-grab; I’ll climb fast and make the entry harder to follow.*

### Turn 205 [GAME]

You hit the rungs and haul up fast, shoulders burning as the shaft narrows your movement into a straight line. The concrete here is dry enough to bite your palms; the rungs are cold metal, gritty with mineral bloom.

A body-length up, you scissor a boot against the wall and kick.

Outcome: you knock down a sheet of dry grit and rust flakes, plus a dangling loop of dead cable you’d missed on the way in. It rains into the junction below in a dirty curtain.

Immediate effect: the pursuer’s light coughs as grit hits the lens. He swears and throws an arm up to shield his face. You hear him choking once, then spitting: “—eyes—!”

The diver arrives at the base of the riser just as the debris falls. Their regulator warbles as they flinch back; the beam wobbles and skates up the shaft, briefly catching your boots and the knife clenched between your teeth.

They don’t stop. The pursuer commits to the climb anyway—metal clanging as he grabs the first rungs one-handed, the other arm still half-numbed from the grille bite. The diver hangs back a half-step, keeping the light angled up to track you.

You keep climbing toward the cleaner-air leak. Above, the leak is real: a thin, steady stream of cool, filtered air coming from a hatch seam. New bolts glint faintly where your eyes adjust—too clean for the drowned stacks.

Consequence: the hatch is not free. A short length of chain is looped through the wheel handle and padlocked—newer metal, oiled. Whoever sealed this expected someone to try it from below.

Below you, the pursuer is climbing fast despite the grit, boots hammering rungs: “She’s going for the hatch! Don’t let her lock us out!”

Threat, clear: you’re about to hit a locked hatch with no key and no time to work it while someone climbs up under you. If you stop at the hatch, you’ll be caught in the shaft. If you try to force it, the noise will carry and you may not have the leverage one-handed.

### Turn 206 [PLAYER]

I hook a boot on a rung, swing down a half-body length, and as his head/light comes into reach I slash at his handhold/strap and kick his forearm hard off the rung. “Climb somewhere else.” Then I drop past him into the junction, hit the service throat low, and crawl-sprint back the way we came to break their line-of-sight.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is chained—no time to pick it. Best move is to turn the shaft into a killzone: drop fast, cut his support, and use the fall to buy a gap to escape back into the junction.*

### Turn 207 [GAME]

You hook your boot, swing down, and meet him on the climb.

Your knife flashes in the shaft’s tight light. You slash at what you can reach—his wrist strap and the light lanyard—then drive your heel into his forearm.

Outcome: the cut bites through webbing and into skin. The strap parts with a snap; his light jerks loose and swings, smacking the wall. Your kick knocks his forearm off the rung.

He loses his hold.

For half a second he’s just weight and panic. Then his other hand snatches a lower rung, but the injured arm flails and scrapes the wall. His boots skid, ringing rungs as he drops two, maybe three steps before he catches himself. He howls, raw and close: “YOU—!”

The diver below throws the beam up instinctively; the shaft fills with jittering glare and your shadow stutters across the concrete. The pursuer tries to climb again, but his cut strap and bleeding hand make him hesitate—he’s shaking it out, trying to regrip.

You drop past him.

Consequence: there isn’t room to “slip by clean.” Your shoulder clips him; he swings into you. His free hand claws at your jacket and finds fabric. For a heartbeat he has you by the back seam.

You tear free—leaving cloth in his fist—and hit the junction hard on your feet and one knee. Pain shoots up your shin where you smack the concrete lip.

You dive into the service throat low and start crawl-sprinting back downslope.

Immediate reaction: the diver commits. They don’t follow into the throat yet—they shove the light to the mouth and angle it to pin you. “Stop! STOP!” comes muffled through the regulator, and then the hard *clack* of something metal on metal—like a hook-pole tip tapping for reach.

Behind them, the pursuer drops to the junction, breathing harsh, voice gone mean and steady now: “She’s running it back. Cut her off—culvert side.”

Threat, clear: they’ve got your line-of-sight with the beam and they’re switching from chase to containment. If there’s a second entry—or someone already staged in the culvert slit—you’re sprinting into a pinch point with a light behind you and a possible body ahead.

### Turn 208 [PLAYER]

I kill my crawl for one beat, yank the loose cable bundle across the throat to snag their hook-pole and smear their light, then roll my body flat and push hard into the darkest edge. If I hit any side conduit or seam before the bend, I take it immediately—otherwise I double back at the last second and go up the riser again to force the locked hatch fight on my terms.

*Agent reasoning: They’re trying to cut me off at the culvert, so I need a fast diversion and a different exit—use the cable clutter and darkness to break the beam, then take any side takeoff before the bend.*

### Turn 209 [GAME]

You stop for a single beat and whip the loose cable bundle across the throat like a blind. It catches.

The hook-pole tip *clinks* into the cable and the bundle wraps half a turn around it. At the same moment it slaps the diver’s light, smearing the beam into a dirty flare and knocking it off-angle. The diver jerks back, regulator barking. “—tangled!”

You flatten and push into the darkest edge, shoulder scraping the wall. Your breath is loud in your own ears; the throat is tight enough that every movement is a rasp of fabric and grit.

Consequence: the cable trick buys you a second, but it also gives them something to pull.

You feel it: the bundle goes taut behind you, dragged hard. The hook-pole is being used like a winch to sweep the throat. Metal scrapes concrete as they drag it side-to-side, probing for your legs.

You reach the first bend—warm draft, right kink—just as the beam steadies again. The light knifes down the throat and catches your boot sole for a blink.

“No—there!” the pursuer snaps, voice raw but focused.

You search for a seam, a takeoff—anything before committing around the bend.

There is one: a recessed wall box on the right side just before the kink, its cover plate hanging by one screw. It’s dark inside, just big enough to jam a body into if you fold hard, but it’s not a tunnel—more like a service cavity with cable stubs and sharp edges.

You take it immediately, twisting in sideways. The loose plate grates against your ribs. Inside, you’re pinned tight; the air smells like old rubber and mouse-dry rot.

Outside, the hook-pole scrapes closer, dragging the cable. The diver’s beam sweeps the floor, then the walls. The pursuer’s boots slosh in the shallow film, stopping right at the kink.

Threat: if the beam hits the wall box opening, you’re found at arm’s length with nowhere to run. And the cable you used is still taut—if they keep hauling, it could snag on the box lip and *point* straight at you.
