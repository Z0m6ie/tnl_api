The soup line curls along the brick wall under a flickering streetlamp, and the air tastes of diesel and boiled onions.\n\nYou stand under the church’s awning with your collar up, notebook open on your palm so the pages don’t soak through. You count faces the way you count exits: slow, patient, twice. A runner’s habit never leaves; you keep your back to stone, eyes on hands, and you let other people think you’re just another cold body waiting for food.\n\nA man in a dock patrol coat stops at the head of the line and flashes a badge to no one in particular. He’s broad in the shoulders, hair clipped close, and you know his jawline from the morgue corridor the day they told you your brother’s death was an accident. He speaks to the volunteer with the ladle, voice flat. “We’re looking for runaways. No papers. New arrivals. Guild wants names before midnight inspections.” The volunteer hesitates, and the patrolman’s gloved hand rests on the baton at his belt like it’s part of the uniform. Two men loiter across the street under a shuttered fishmonger sign, pretending to smoke while they watch the line and the church door. Then you see the detail that doesn’t fit: a girl near the wall has salt crusted at her cuffs and a yellowing bruise on her inner elbow, like a sedation injection. When she shifts, a torn tag slips from her sleeve and sticks to her wet skin—Meridian Assurance underwriting code, the same format you’ve got penciled beside your brother’s file.\n\nSister Calwen appears in the doorway and catches your eye. She tilts her head once toward the side entrance that leads down to the crypts, then looks past you at the patrolman as he starts down the line, asking for names.",

Up close, the bruise on her inner elbow is the color of old ink, and there’s a faint antiseptic smell under the wet wool of her sleeve.\n\nShe answers without turning her head. “I can—” Her jaw tightens. “Not fast.”\n\nYou shift in front of her as the patrolman reaches the next cluster of bodies. For half a breath it works: your coat and shoulder take up the patrolman’s line of sight, and the girl uses the moment to step out of the queue like she’s just giving someone room. You put a hand lightly at her elbow—guiding, not dragging—and angle her toward the narrow side passage beside the church.\n\nAcross the street, one of the “smokers” stops pretending. He drops his cigarette, grinds it out with a neat heel, and pushes off the wall. The other stays put but turns his head, tracking you. Their attention isn’t casual; it’s practiced, like they’ve been told what to look for.\n\nThe patrolman hears the scuff of feet on wet stone and snaps his gaze over the line. His eyes catch the girl’s salt-stained cuffs and the way she favors one leg. “Hey.” He steps toward you, hand leaving the baton and opening like he’s going to take a wrist. “You—stop. Where’s she going?”\n\nSister Calwen is already at the side entrance, half in shadow, keys in hand. She doesn’t call out. She just holds the door cracked, watching you and the patrolman with a face that doesn’t give him anything to hook.\n\nThe girl’s breathing goes shallow. She whispers, almost into your collar, “If he sees my arm—” and she tugs her sleeve down hard enough to wince.\n\nThe nearer smoker has crossed the street curb-to-curb and is now ten paces away, coming in at an angle that will cut off the passage if he keeps walking. He doesn’t show a badge. He doesn’t need to. His right hand stays in his coat pocket like it’s holding something heavy.\n\nYou’re between the patrolman and the girl, with the side door three steps away—and someone is moving to box you in.",

She swings the side door wider just enough to make a gap, and the girl slips through it on your cue—no run, just a stiff, careful walk like she’s afraid her joints will give out. Calwen’s hand closes around the girl’s shoulder and pulls her inside. The door starts to come shut.\n\nThe patrolman lunges a step too late and catches the edge of the door with his boot. Wood thuds against leather. “Hold it,” he barks, suddenly loud enough to turn heads in the soup line. “Guild business. I need to—”\n\nCalwen’s voice comes out calm, edged with steel. “Not in my parish you don’t. If you have a warrant, you can show it in the daylight like a civilized man.”\n\nYour shout at the approaching “smoker” lands. “You with Dock Patrol? Badge out if you’re stepping in.”\n\nHe stops—two paces short of the passage mouth—and smiles without warmth. He slowly removes his hand from his coat pocket. No badge. Just a small, flat brass token on a chain, flashed and tucked away again too fast for anyone else to catch. Enough to tell you he’s not patrol; he’s something adjacent that doesn’t answer to uniforms.\n\n“Watch your tone,” he says, quiet, and then to the patrolman without looking at him: “She’s not on the list. Let the Sister close her door.”\n\nThe patrolman’s face tightens. He keeps his boot in the door a beat longer, then withdraws it like he’s doing Calwen a favor. The door shuts—firm, final. The girl is inside.\n\nAcross the street, the second loiterer pushes off the wall and starts walking too—not toward the church, but down the block, taking a line that’ll put him on the far end of the alley that runs behind Saint Brigid. A net, not a rush.\n\nThe patrolman points at you with two fingers. “You. I know you. Don’t make this about you tonight.” Then he turns and starts back down the soup line, asking names louder than before, punishing the room for being watched.\n\nThe brass-token man stays where he is, eyes on you, measuring. “You just bought her five minutes,” he says. “What’re you spending them on?”",

Names that ‘need correcting.’ People that make policies… complicated.”\n\nWhen you ask what he is, his eyes flick toward the soup line where the patrolman is still barking for paperwork. Then back to you.\n\n“I’m the part that keeps tonight from turning into a street fight,” he says. “Call me a mediator.”\n\nHe shifts his weight—subtle—and you realize he’s positioned so he can see both the side door and the street corner. Not protecting you. Controlling angles.\n\nBehind you, the side door latch clicks again from inside—Sister Calwen throwing an extra bolt. Whatever route she’s using, she’s committing to it.\n\nDown the block, the second man reaches the mouth of the alley behind Saint Brigid. He doesn’t go in right away. He pauses, looks up at the church’s rear windows, then slips into the darkness. A moment later, you hear a soft metallic scrape—like a trash lid being eased, not kicked.\n\nThe brass-token man watches your face as if he expects you to run for the alley. “If you go back there,” he says softly, “you’ll meet someone who doesn’t flash anything before he works.”\n\nAcross the line, the patrolman’s voice rises again: “No papers? Then step out. Now.” You hear a small protest, a chair leg skittering on wet stone, and the volunteer with the ladle says, “Officer, please—”\n\nThe brass-token man takes one step closer—close enough that you can see the faint scar at the corner of his mouth. “You’re Lena Marrow,” he says, not asking. “Meridian already left a card at your office this morning. That means they’re not hunting blind anymore. So: walk away from Saint Brigid tonight, or you’ll force the Sister to choose between her people and you.”\n\nHe tilts his head toward the street, where the patrolman is starting to pull someone out of line by the sleeve. “And you’ve got about ten seconds before that turns ugly.”",

Instead he reaches into his coat slowly, like he’s giving you time to decide whether to panic, and produces a folded card stock—thick, expensive. He holds it up just long enough for you to see a blind-embossed mark: **MERIDIAN ASSURANCE COMBINE**. No name, no title. Just a policy-number string stamped in black at the bottom. Then it’s back in his pocket.\n\n“I answer to the paper,” he says. “Same as everyone else.”\n\nFrom the alley mouth behind Saint Brigid, you see movement: the man who slipped in is no longer alone. A second figure steps into view behind him—shorter, shoulders squared, cap pulled low. They don’t rush. They position themselves: one near the trash bins, one near the rear wall, both watching the church’s back windows and the side door. One of them has something in his hand that catches the streetlamp for a blink—metal, narrow. A tool, or a blade.\n\nYour call to the side door gets an answer, but not from the door. It comes from a grated basement window set into the church foundation, a few feet from the steps.\n\nSister Calwen’s voice, tight and controlled: “I’m here. Stop calling my name.”\n\nA pause—then, quieter: “Yes. There’s a way through. But if they hear where, it becomes a trap.”\n\nThe patrolman swings his head toward you, eyes narrowing. “Marrow,” he says, like a warning. He lets go of the woman’s sleeve and steps toward you instead, hand hovering near his baton. “You obstructing an inquiry? Because I can make that official.”\n\nThe brass-token man shifts half a step—placing himself so he can block the patrolman’s line to you if it comes to it, while still keeping the alley in his peripheral. “This is how it starts,” he murmurs. “Noise.

His hand drops from the baton to his belt, but he doesn’t relax—he uses the space you give him to reclaim the line.\n\n“Good,” he says. He turns back to the soup queue and points at two people in quick succession. “You. And you. Papers.” His tone says he’s punishing the whole line for your interference.\n\nAt the basement grate, there’s a faint scrape—something heavy sliding over stone. Calwen doesn’t answer you with words. She answers with action: the volunteer with the ladle suddenly pivots, blocking the patrolman’s view of the church steps with her body and a sloshing pot, while another volunteer “accidentally” knocks over a crate of stale rolls, drawing eyes and curses. It’s clumsy on purpose. Cover.\n\nIn that same beat, the thin woman the patrolman had yanked is guided—not pushed, guided—back into the press of bodies and then sideways toward the church wall. She disappears behind the volunteers’ skirts and the steam off the soup pot. No one sees a door open. No one sees a door close. She’s just… gone from the line.\n\nBehind Saint Brigid, the alley figures react to the sudden bustle. The shorter one raises a hand once—two fingers, quick—and the man by the bins shifts position to get a better angle on the foundation windows. They’re not “your people” in the sense of obeying you, and they don’t look like they’re taking orders from the brass-token man either.\n\nWhen you press him—call them off or tell you what they’re waiting to catch—his mouth tightens.\n\n“They’re waiting on a mistake,” he says. “A door. A hatch. A face they can swear they recognized.”\n\nHe glances past you at the patrolman. “And he’s waiting for you to make one.”\n\nThe patrolman snaps, loud enough for the block to hear: “Nobody moves off that line unless I say so.” He steps closer to the church steps, trying to reassert control of the space you just helped Calwen blur.\n\nThe brass-token man leans in, voice barely above the rain: “If you keep standing here, you become the reason they search the church. If you leave, you become the reason the alley men follow.”\n\nConcrete threat, now: the patrolman is about to order a search of Saint Brigid’s entrance area, and the two in the alley are poised to intercept anyone exiting through a low route along the foundation.",

Produce rolls out, wet paper wrapping tearing. People jump back; one dockhand curses and grabs his shin. A wagon driver yanks his reins, shouting as a wheel splashes through a puddle and clips the crate—wood splinters snap and skid.\n\nThe commotion does what you want—half the line’s attention snaps away from the church steps. Two volunteers surge forward, scolding and shooing bodies back from the street. For a moment, the church entrance area is less watched.\n\nBut it also gives the patrolman an excuse to move.\n\n“Clear that!” he snaps, and steps off his post toward the street mess—close enough now that he can see along the church wall and the steps again. He gestures to a second uniform you hadn’t clocked at first—standing under the eave across the way—who starts angling toward the church side door with a hand on his coat like he’s ready to push through if ordered.\n\nBehind you, the man who peeled off keeps coming. In the window reflection, he doesn’t hurry; he uses the same pauses you do—stops when you stop, resumes when you resume.

He doesn’t refuse, but he doesn’t commit either. “Patrol’s already thick tonight,” he says carefully, voice raised to match yours. “You cause trouble in my shop, they’ll treat it like my trouble.”\n\nThe tail at the dry goods shelf turns a tin over, reading the label like it’s fascinating. He doesn’t leave.\n\nYou scan for a back exit. There is one—**a curtained door marked “STOCK”** behind the counter. But as you angle your head, you see the detail that kills the easy escape: a **chain looped through the back door’s push bar**, padlocked from the inside. The clerk follows your glance and says, flat: “Back’s not for customers.”\n\nOutside, through the front glass, the alley-tail under the pawnshop awning shifts—then raises two fingers briefly to someone out of frame, like a signal.\n\nA moment later, the shop bell chimes again. A **second man** steps in—different from the first tail, heavier build, hands bare despite the cold. He doesn’t browse. He just stands by the door, blocking the easiest exit without making it look like he’s blocking it.\n\nThreat, plain: you’re now **contained in the shop**—one watcher inside “shopping,” one inside on the door, and at least one set of eyes outside coordinating.

He fires at the shelf end where you *were*.\n\nThe shot punches into the floorboards behind you with a splintering crack; wood chips sting your cheek.

It clatters, loud in the small shop.\n\nThe oilskin intruder with the hook-blade surges out from the shelf line, trying to follow your roll, but he hesitates as the doorway fills: a patrolman’s silhouette and a raised revolver appear in the entrance.\n\n“DROP IT!” the newcomer roars.\n\nThe gunman snaps his pistol toward the door instead of finishing you. He fires once at the silhouette. The patrolman at the entrance jerks back out of sight, and you hear a pained shout and a body hitting the wet brick outside.\n\nNow the shop has two active threats in motion: the gunman trading fire with patrol at the doorway, and the hook-blade intruder angling to cut you off from the counter while you’re still on the floor, exposed between shelf and counter with your coat shredded and your pant leg torn.",

His hand goes useless for a second, fingers flexing wrong, and he clamps his other hand over the cut, rocking on his hip with a thin, panicked moan.\n\nYour coat hem tears with a sharp rip as you wrench free.

You make it a full body-length deeper under the counter line—quieter cover, farther from the counter end.\n\nAt the doorway, your whisper reaches patrol. One of them answers back just as low, like they’re learning: “Copy. Quiet.”\n\nThen the gunman does what you warned: he leans to listen.\n\nYou don’t hear his boots this time—he’s careful—but you do hear the faint brush of his sleeve on the frame. A heartbeat later, patrol’s longarm cracks from outside—one clean shot.\n\nThe round hits wood, not flesh. It punches the doorframe just above where his head would’ve been if he’d leaned another inch.

The bullet takes a glass jar off a shelf; it explodes into sugar and shards that rain down, tinkling across the tile and into the quiet like thrown gravel.\n\nThe wounded hook-blade man is no longer grabbing you—he’s bleeding and retreating on his elbows toward the back wall, leaving a smear. But he’s still conscious, eyes wide, watching you with raw hate and fear, and his uninjured hand is feeling around for *anything* to arm himself with.\n\nThreats now: **gunman still at the frame, trading shots with patrol and probing by sound**; **wounded man mobile and desperate, seeking a new weapon inside the shop**.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

The opening is just barely man-sized, and the lower edge is sharp with broken mortar.\n\nYou wave Rusk over. He starts to climb down from the shelf, moving too fast, panic in him now.\n\nThen the calm voice outside calls, sharp: “She found the panel—window side! Shoot the hinges if it opens!”\n\nA shadow crosses the high window again, and something metallic taps the glass from outside—someone lining up.\n\nThe next hit comes immediately.\n\n*WHAM—SNAP.*\n\nThe deadbolt tears partway through the softened wood. The door doesn’t fly open yet, but it lurches inward an inch, held by the remaining splinters and the warped bolt. Through the gap you see oilskin knees and the dull black nose of a pistol probing for angle.\n\nThreat, clear: in seconds they can force the door fully; there’s a gun already fishing through the gap, and someone outside is ready to fire toward the hatch/window side if they get a sightline. The hatch is open, but it’s a cramped, sharp-edged drop into a dark service run—easy to snag, easy to get stuck if you rush.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Service run (behind iron access panel)\"],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

His lantern-less silhouette is a darker shape against the faint, dirty glow behind him. He slows at the edge, hook hand up, listening for breath.\n\nThen he does something worse than rushing: he lowers the hook head over the lip and lets it hang, cable paying out quietly. He’s fishing the drop and the left turn by feel, trying to snag whatever’s below without exposing himself.\n\nThe hook head swings once… twice… and starts drifting toward the pipe at the corner.

You follow tight behind, hook-blade scraping along the right-hand masonry in short, controlled strokes.\n\nThe scrape tells you what your eyes can’t: rough brick and mortar at first—then, a few feet on, the blade kisses something smooth and cold protruding from the wall: a thin metal strap or conduit clip. You lift the blade off it immediately and shift your line even closer to the stone, palms careful, fingers spread to avoid anything wet.\n\nThe floor changes texture under your knees—wetter, with a slick film that pulls at fabric.

A half-second later, another *slap*—it’s bounced into a second puddle closer to the bend.\n\nThe hook-man reacts to the sound exactly as intended: you hear him surge forward. His boot lands in the wet with an unmistakable skid and a hard scrape against stone. He catches himself with a curse—“Shit!”—and his hook head clacks once as it taps the floor.\n\nBut he doesn’t go down. He slows, adjusts, and starts coming again—more careful now, dragging the hook low like a feeler.\n\nRusk keeps you on the drier right edge, but the “dry” is relative: the right wall is crumbling and narrow here, and the wet film is creeping across it in streaks. Ahead, the passage opens into a junction space: you can make out a squat boxy silhouette on the left wall (likely an old service cabinet) and a darker trench-like channel cut into the floor where water is flowing.\n\nThreats are now clear and close:\n- **Behind:** the pursuer is still advancing, slowed by the slick but adapting; you can hear his careful steps and the hook probing.\n- **Ahead/left:** the metal run and service cabinet area are likely energized; the wet channel on the floor is actively moving water, widening the hazard zone as you approach the junction.",

In the wider section the conduit opens enough to see it: a rusted maintenance ladder bolted into the right wall, rungs slick with condensation. He grabs it and starts climbing, boots clanging softly—fast, ugly, determined.\n\nYou keep your back to the right wall and shuffle-retreat, blade low.\n\nThe hook-man takes the hint and goes for your feet. He snaps the hook in low, a quick ankle-height jab meant to catch and pull. You swat it aside with the hook-blade; steel bites steel with a grating *krrt* and the hook glances off toward the trench instead of into your shin.\n\nAs you move, you angle a step and kick the severed belt end off the lip.\n\nIt flips out into the trench and slaps the water.\n\nFor a half-second it just floats—then the cable under the surface twitches and the water answers with that too-clean blue flash. The belt end jerks like it’s alive and sinks, smoking faintly. The air sharpens with burnt leather and copper.\n\nThe hook-man recoils from the flash, but it also tells him something: the trench is “live” enough to punish anything that falls in. He stops trying to muscle you and shifts to forcing a mistake—short, impatient feints that try to make you step wide.\n\nAbove you, Rusk reaches the top of the ladder—or what passes for “top” here: a dark square cutout with a lip of corroded metal. He wedges a shoulder through and hisses down, breath ragged: “Hatch—stuck—”\n\nImmediate, concrete danger: the hook-man is about to commit to a hard, two-handed yank aimed at your blade arm—trying to knock your guard wide so his next low sweep can take your footing. One stumble, and the electrified trench is directly under your left foot.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Maintenance ladder (wider conduit section)\"],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

You drive your forearm into the hook’s shaft and pin it against your hook-blade, turning his leverage into a cramped wrestle.\n\nHe tries to wrench free anyway—shoulders bunching, elbows flaring—but your stomp lands on his forward shin/boot edge with a solid, ugly *crack*.\n\nHe barks out a sound that’s half pain, half fury, and his stance buckles. The hook dips; the point scrapes stone and sparks once as it kisses the wet lip.\n\nYou get your heartbeat of space.\n\nYou back into the base of the ladder, keeping the blade between you and him, and set your hand on the lowest rung to start up.\n\nHe recovers faster than you’d like. Limping, he changes tactics: instead of pulling, he swings the hook head sideways at knee height, aiming to catch the ladder upright itself—either to yank you off as you climb or to rattle Rusk above.\n\nThe hook catches the ladder’s side rail with a metallic *CLONK* and he hauls.\n\nThe whole ladder shudders.

The hatch lip overhead gives a little—metal squealing—then stops, still mostly jammed.\n\nImmediate threat: if the hook-man gets a second solid pull on the ladder rail, it’ll wrench you off-balance at the base and could peel Rusk off his rung above; either of you could fall—into each other or off the lip toward the live trench.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

There’s still a hand-wide gap on one side.\n\nYou jam your hook-blade through the gap, catching it under a corroded crossbar/hasp nub on the frame. Metal squeals as you lever the blade sideways to bite.

The patch twitches but doesn’t lift. Your makeshift bar holds for the moment.\n\nYou call down. “You know my name, so you know I don’t bluff. Tell me who you are, and send the kid back—hands empty.”\n\nSilence for two beats. Then the larger voice answers, calm but with pain clipped into it. “Name doesn’t matter. I’m the one keeping this from turning into a body count.”\n\nThe kid’s whisper floats up from the dark, closer now, like they’ve been pushed forward anyway. “I— I don’t have anything—”\n\nA hand appears in the seam again—smaller this time. Two empty fingers, shaking, slide up as proof. The kid isn’t climbing through; they’re being used as a shield, again—held just under the opening where you can’t see what’s behind them.\n\nAt the hatch, metal scrapes.

The hatch edge rises another fraction, and you hear the wedge board Rusk had braced with give a sharp *crack*—not broken through, but split.\n\nYou tell Rusk, low: “Far corner. Find anything we can jam in that hatch track—pipe, spike—whatever. Don’t go near the opening.”\n\nRusk moves fast, keeping low.

The hook tip stabs through and catches air—then clinks against the hatch frame like it’s measuring the gap. One more good pry and a shoulder can fit.\n\nUnder your knee, pressure builds: the larger climber below shifts position for a coordinated heave. You feel it through the boards—weight settling, then bracing—like someone planting feet on a rung and putting both hands to the underside.\n\nThreats, immediate:\n- Hatch: now open roughly a handspan and widening with each pry; entry is imminent.\n- Patch: a full-force shove is coming; if it breaks your bar’s purchase, the panel will pop and someone will surge up under you.",

The panel shudders once under a probing push; your wedge steals the lift.\n\n“Body-count guy—talk fast. Who’s downstairs with the hook, and why are you using a drugged kid as a shield?”\n\nA wet exhale from below—pain and annoyance. “Because the kid’s already marked. Same as you.” A pause, then, sharper: “The one at the hatch isn’t mine. Guild safety—oilskins, hook tool. He’s here to ‘inspect’ and he doesn’t care who he steps on.”\n\nThat answers one thing and makes another worse: there are at least two groups converging in the same crawlspace, and neither wants witnesses.\n\nAt the hatch, the prying becomes a rhythm—*pry… reset… pry*—and the gap widens to two hands. You can hear the hook-man’s breath now, close and steady.\n\nRusk moves to the “safe” side like you ordered—keeping his body away from the opening. He uses the conduit strap like a long spoon, nudging the short iron rod toward the hatch track from the corner angle. It’s awkward; he can’t reach straight on without exposing himself.\n\nThe rod scrapes, catches, then slides into something metal-on-metal with a harsh *clang*. For a second the hatch stops rising—jammed against the rod.\n\nThen the hook below snags the rod. The metal shrieks as it’s pulled, twisting in the track. Rusk braces and shoves back with the strap, but the leverage is against him; the rod starts to inch toward the opening.\n\nUnder your knee, the bigger climber below commits to the heave. The patch bows—your cross-plank bites under the joist lip, holds, and the whole assembly groans like it might tear free. Your blade-wedge vibrates in the seam from the pressure.\n\nNew, immediate threats:\n- Hatch: the hook-man is now actively trying to yank the rod out; if he gets it free, he’s coming through fast.\n- Patch: one more full-body shove risks ripping your bar’s “hook” off the joist; if it slips, the panel will pop up under you.",

The patch stays down, but it bows under you like a drumhead.\n\nYou hook your blade through the hatch gap and snag the loosened wedge-board and splintered scraps, dragging them into the opening. Wood jams into the frame crooked. The hatch lip catches; the gap becomes a jagged mouth full of teeth.\n\nFrom below comes an immediate, furious hiss and a sharp *crack*—a knuckle or tool striking the jam. Then a wet grunt.

A signal.\n\nThe hook-man at the hatch changes tactics. Instead of forcing up into the jam, he starts working laterally—hook scraping along the hatch edge like he’s trying to peel your snag out from the side. The hatch flexes with each pull.\n\nThen: boots on metal rungs below—another set, heavier, coming up fast. Someone else is climbing toward the hatch, and they’re not stopping to be careful.\n\nConcrete threats now:\n- Hatch: your snag is holding, but it’s being actively peeled; a second climber is arriving to add force.

I want you not dead, because you’re the only one in this crawl who can make noise that sticks.”\n\nAt the hatch, the hook tool scrapes again—metal on wood—testing for your blade. You hear a second man arrive on the rungs: boots hit the last rung with a dull clang, then he crowds the first.\n\nEd continues, fast: “Two at the hatch. Hook-man and a heavier one. There’s at least one more behind them—heard the ladder sing twice before they got here.”\n\nThe hook-man speaks up from directly under the jam, voice calm and official. “Harbor Authority Safety. Midnight inspection. You’re impeding a lawful access point.”\n\nThen the heavier one—breathing hard—doesn’t bother with words. He rams his shoulder up into the hatch frame. The jammed scraps jump; your snag holds, but the whole hatch lip flexes and sheds splinters.

Tight. Ring-bolt here—could lash something. No fuel. Smells like tar and dust only.”\n\nBelow, Ed shifts—careful now, less pressure on the patch. “If they breach, they’ll come for you first.

The leather bites; the buckle clicks; the hatch lid jerks downward an inch as the strap takes tension.\n\n“Move,” he breathes, and snakes into the right-side crawl on his elbows, boots scraping tar as he goes.\n\nYou drive the hook-blade into the gap and twist.\n\nThe next shoulder-ram comes like a battering wave.

A smaller set of feet scuffs away; a stifled whimper gets swallowed. “Kid’s back,” Ed says. “I’m not touching it.”\n\nYou keep your knee planted on the patch until the last possible second, then slide off and into the right-side crawl. It’s tight—shoulders scraping, cheek against gritty brick. Behind you, the patch immediately rises a fraction with the relief of your weight, but it doesn’t blow; Ed keeps still.\n\nThen the belt gives with a wet snap.\n\nThe hatch pops up a handspan before the hook-blade, still jammed, torques and spits free. A gloved hand snakes in, fingers clawing for purchase. Light from below knifes into the service space in a hard rectangle, and a voice follows it—hook-man, satisfied: “There. Got you.”\n\nYou are in the crawl, moving, but they now have an open gap and line of sight into the upper space you just left, and they know exactly which way you went.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[\"belt (taken from wounded man)\"],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Right-side maintenance crawl (tight)\"],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

It’s already loose—someone’s been in here before.\n\nYou hook your fingertips under the edge and yank. The cover peels free with a sharp metallic rasp that echoes down the crawl like a shout. Rusk freezes, then keeps going faster.\n\nYou twist and jam the sheet-metal panel crosswise in the crawl behind you, wedging it between brick and ceiling. It holds—barely—bowing in the middle. It won’t stop a determined man, but it will force them to slow, to wriggle and curse and make noise.\n\nImmediately, a gloved hand smacks into it from the far side. The panel flexes with a booming clang. A voice—closer now, breathy with the squeeze—spits, “They threw a plate. Get a light up here.”\n\nAnother thud. The panel shudders; one tab starts to slip, scraping mortar dust into your hair.\n\nRusk reaches the junction ahead—an older conduit intersection where the space opens enough to turn your shoulders. “Here,” he hisses. “Drop’s right there—don’t look down too long.”\n\nYou’ve bought seconds, not safety.

The Saint Brigid Mutual Aid Society runs soup lines and rent relief; behind the hymns it launders money and shelters runaways—some willingly, some not—making it both Lena’s best lead and worst blind spot. Over them sits the Meridian Assurance Combine, a respectable insurer funding civic reforms; secretly it engineers deaths to cash policies and pressure clients into dependency.

      "A dockworkers’ safety strike has choked Pier Nine after two “equipment failures” in a week; the Harbor Authority Guild responds with midnight inspections and quiet arrests, while Meridian Assurance agents offer “emergency coverage” that reads like a shakedown. At the same time, Saint Brigid’s soup line is overwhelmed by new runaways—some drugged, all missing paperwork—and Sister Calwen is moving them through the church crypts as Guild watchers prowl the alleys. Lena’s name is circulating in Combine claim offices, and a familiar face from her brother’s case has resurfaced near the harbor morgue.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"events\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Pier Nine Safety Strike and Midnight Inspections\",\n      \"description\": \"Dockworkers halt operations at Pier Nine after two staged 'equipment failures.'

      "Rain turns Pier Nine into a mirror that won’t hold a face. Lena Marrow is there because the second “equipment failure” matches a note in her battered notebook: the same blue-clean neon reflection in a puddle, the same copper taste in the air, the same kind of witness who vanishes before they can testify. A striker slips her a torn safety tag pried off a snapped hoist—its serial number doesn’t belong to any Guild registry, but it *does* match a Meridian Assurance underwriting code she’s seen once before, tucked into her brother’s “accident” file.\n\nBy morning, two things happen. First: a Meridian claims clerk leaves a polite card at Lena’s office with no name, only a policy number and a time. The paper is expensive; the message is cheap: they know she’s looking. Second: a dockside patrolman—familiar from the morgue corridor the day her brother died—shows up near Saint Brigid’s soup line, asking after “runaways with missing papers,” like he’s been assigned a shopping list.\n\nSaint Brigid is overflowing tonight. Some of the new arrivals have sedation bruises and saltwater in their shoes, like they were dragged off a boat and cleaned up badly. Sister Calwen offers Lena a whisper of access through the crypts—sanctuary, information, names—if Lena can keep the Guild spotters from counting heads.\n\nEvery path is a door: Pier Nine’s midnight inspections, the morgue’s back ledger, the crypt routes under Saint Brigid, the Combine’s “meeting.” Each door opens both ways."

Guild wants names before midnight inspections.” The volunteer hesitates, and the patrolman’s gloved hand rests on the baton at his belt like it’s part of the uniform. Two men loiter across the street under a shuttered fishmonger sign, pretending to smoke while they watch the line and the church door. Then you see the detail that doesn’t fit: a girl near the wall has salt crusted at her cuffs and a yellowing bruise on her inner elbow, like a sedation injection. When she shifts, a torn tag slips from her sleeve and sticks to her wet skin—Meridian Assurance underwriting code, the same format you’ve got penciled beside your brother’s file.\n\nSister Calwen appears in the doorway and catches your eye. She tilts her head once toward the side entrance that leads down to the crypts, then looks past you at the patrolman as he starts down the line, asking for names."

      "Rain needles the harbor district, turning soot to ink and streetlamps into trembling halos. The air tastes of brine, diesel, and old copper; every breath feels borrowed. Barges groan against pilings, chains clink in the dark, and somewhere a foghorn moans like a warning you can’t translate. Alley puddles hold broken neon—blue, sickly, too clean to be honest—while tenement windows sweat light through cracked glass. Footsteps never echo alone; there’s always a second rhythm, softer, patient. Paper sticks to your shoe, pulped into yesterday’s headlines. The city keeps moving, but it moves like a man hiding a limp.",
      "Rain-slick Harbor City is “kept afloat” by three powers. The Harbor Authority Guild publicly manages docks, permits, and safety audits; in truth it stages “accidents” to erase witnesses and steer contraband through favored berths. The Saint Brigid Mutual Aid Society runs soup lines and rent relief; behind the hymns it launders money and shelters runaways—some willingly, some not—making it both Lena’s best lead and worst blind spot. Over them sits the Meridian Assurance Combine, a respectable insurer funding civic reforms; secretly it engineers deaths to cash policies and pressure clients into dependency. The Combine bankrolls the Guild, the Society feeds it names, and all three quietly hunt whoever keeps surviving.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"factions\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Harbor Authority Guild\",\n      \"public_front\": \"Regulates docks, issues permits, conducts safety inspections, and coordinates harbor security.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Orchestrates “accidents” to eliminate witnesses, control shipping lanes, and protect a contraband pipeline.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Saint Brigid Mutual Aid Society\",\n      \"public_front\": \"Provides soup kitchens, rent relief, and sanctuary services in the tenements and waterfront parishes.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Launders money and runs a covert shelter/transport network for missing persons—some rescued, some coerced.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Meridian Assurance Combine\",\n      \"public_front\": \"Citywide insurance and pension provider sponsoring public-safety campaigns and civic modernization.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Engineers coordinated deaths for payouts and leverage, forcing businesses and families into long-term dependence.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

      "A dockworkers’ safety strike has choked Pier Nine after two “equipment failures” in a week; the Harbor Authority Guild responds with midnight inspections and quiet arrests, while Meridian Assurance agents offer “emergency coverage” that reads like a shakedown. At the same time, Saint Brigid’s soup line is overwhelmed by new runaways—some drugged, all missing paperwork—and Sister Calwen is moving them through the church crypts as Guild watchers prowl the alleys. Lena’s name is circulating in Combine claim offices, and a familiar face from her brother’s case has resurfaced near the harbor morgue.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"events\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Pier Nine Safety Strike and Midnight Inspections\",\n      \"description\": \"Dockworkers halt operations at Pier Nine after two staged 'equipment failures.'

      "Rain turns Pier Nine into a mirror that won’t hold a face. Lena Marrow is there because the second “equipment failure” matches a note in her battered notebook: the same blue-clean neon reflection in a puddle, the same copper taste in the air, the same kind of witness who vanishes before they can testify. A striker slips her a torn safety tag pried off a snapped hoist—its serial number doesn’t belong to any Guild registry, but it *does* match a Meridian Assurance underwriting code she’s seen once before, tucked into her brother’s “accident” file.\n\nBy morning, two things happen. First: a Meridian claims clerk leaves a polite card at Lena’s office with no name, only a policy number and a time. The paper is expensive; the message is cheap: they know she’s looking. Second: a dockside patrolman—familiar from the morgue corridor the day her brother died—shows up near Saint Brigid’s soup line, asking after “runaways with missing papers,” like he’s been assigned a shopping list.\n\nSaint Brigid is overflowing tonight. Some of the new arrivals have sedation bruises and saltwater in their shoes, like they were dragged off a boat and cleaned up badly. Sister Calwen offers Lena a whisper of access through the crypts—sanctuary, information, names—if Lena can keep the Guild spotters from counting heads.\n\nEvery path is a door: Pier Nine’s midnight inspections, the morgue’s back ledger, the crypt routes under Saint Brigid, the Combine’s “meeting.” Each door opens both ways."

The soup line curls along the brick wall under a flickering streetlamp, and the air tastes of diesel and boiled onions.\n\nYou stand under the church’s awning with your collar up, notebook open on your palm so the pages don’t soak through. You count faces the way you count exits: slow, patient, twice. A runner’s habit never leaves; you keep your back to stone, eyes on hands, and you let other people think you’re just another cold body waiting for food.\n\nA man in a dock patrol coat stops at the head of the line and flashes a badge to no one in particular. He’s broad in the shoulders, hair clipped close, and you know his jawline from the morgue corridor the day they told you your brother’s death was an accident. He speaks to the volunteer with the ladle, voice flat. “We’re looking for runaways. No papers. New arrivals. Guild wants names before midnight inspections.” The volunteer hesitates, and the patrolman’s gloved hand rests on the baton at his belt like it’s part of the uniform. Two men loiter across the street under a shuttered fishmonger sign, pretending to smoke while they watch the line and the church door. Then you see the detail that doesn’t fit: a girl near the wall has salt crusted at her cuffs and a yellowing bruise on her inner elbow, like a sedation injection. When she shifts, a torn tag slips from her sleeve and sticks to her wet skin—Meridian Assurance underwriting code, the same format you’ve got penciled beside your brother’s file.\n\nSister Calwen appears in the doorway and catches your eye. She tilts her head once toward the side entrance that leads down to the crypts, then looks past you at the patrolman as he starts down the line, asking for names."

Sister’s taking people in the side door.” I angle my body to block the patrolman’s view and, if she moves, I guide her toward Calwen’s side entrance, watching the two “smokers” across the street the whole time."
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The girl flinches at your voice like it’s a slap, then forces herself to keep her eyes on the soup pot. Up close, the bruise on her inner elbow is the color of old ink, and there’s a faint antiseptic smell under the wet wool of her sleeve.\n\nShe answers without turning her head. “I can—” Her jaw tightens. “Not fast.”\n\nYou shift in front of her as the patrolman reaches the next cluster of bodies. For half a breath it works: your coat and shoulder take up the patrolman’s line of sight, and the girl uses the moment to step out of the queue like she’s just giving someone room. You put a hand lightly at her elbow—guiding, not dragging—and angle her toward the narrow side passage beside the church.\n\nAcross the street, one of the “smokers” stops pretending. He drops his cigarette, grinds it out with a neat heel, and pushes off the wall. The other stays put but turns his head, tracking you. Their attention isn’t casual; it’s practiced, like they’ve been told what to look for.\n\nThe patrolman hears the scuff of feet on wet stone and snaps his gaze over the line. His eyes catch the girl’s salt-stained cuffs and the way she favors one leg. “Hey.” He steps toward you, hand leaving the baton and opening like he’s going to take a wrist. “You—stop. Where’s she going?”\n\nSister Calwen is already at the side entrance, half in shadow, keys in hand. She doesn’t call out. She just holds the door cracked, watching you and the patrolman with a face that doesn’t give him anything to hook.\n\nThe girl’s breathing goes shallow. She whispers, almost into your collar, “If he sees my arm—” and she tugs her sleeve down hard enough to wince.\n\nThe nearer smoker has crossed the street curb-to-curb and is now ten paces away, coming in at an angle that will cut off the passage if he keeps walking. He doesn’t show a badge. He doesn’t need to. His right hand stays in his coat pocket like it’s holding something heavy.\n\nYou’re between the patrolman and the girl, with the side door three steps away—and someone is moving to box you in."

Your body blocks his reach, and for a second his eyes flick past you to the girl’s sleeve like he’s trying to see through cloth.\n\n“About to be sick,” you say. “Sister’s got a cot and a bucket.”\n\nSister Calwen doesn’t miss the opening. She swings the side door wider just enough to make a gap, and the girl slips through it on your cue—no run, just a stiff, careful walk like she’s afraid her joints will give out. Calwen’s hand closes around the girl’s shoulder and pulls her inside. The door starts to come shut.\n\nThe patrolman lunges a step too late and catches the edge of the door with his boot. Wood thuds against leather. “Hold it,” he barks, suddenly loud enough to turn heads in the soup line. “Guild business. I need to—”\n\nCalwen’s voice comes out calm, edged with steel. “Not in my parish you don’t. If you have a warrant, you can show it in the daylight like a civilized man.”\n\nYour shout at the approaching “smoker” lands. “You with Dock Patrol? Badge out if you’re stepping in.”\n\nHe stops—two paces short of the passage mouth—and smiles without warmth. He slowly removes his hand from his coat pocket. No badge. Just a small, flat brass token on a chain, flashed and tucked away again too fast for anyone else to catch. Enough to tell you he’s not patrol; he’s something adjacent that doesn’t answer to uniforms.\n\n“Watch your tone,” he says, quiet, and then to the patrolman without looking at him: “She’s not on the list. Let the Sister close her door.”\n\nThe patrolman’s face tightens. He keeps his boot in the door a beat longer, then withdraws it like he’s doing Calwen a favor. The door shuts—firm, final. The girl is inside.\n\nAcross the street, the second loiterer pushes off the wall and starts walking too—not toward the church, but down the block, taking a line that’ll put him on the far end of the alley that runs behind Saint Brigid. A net, not a rush.\n\nThe patrolman points at you with two fingers. “You. I know you. Don’t make this about you tonight.” Then he turns and starts back down the soup line, asking names louder than before, punishing the room for being watched.\n\nThe brass-token man stays where he is, eyes on you, measuring. “You just bought her five minutes,” he says. “What’re you spending them on?”"

      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The brass-token man keeps his hands empty and low, like he’s showing you he doesn’t need to hurry. Rain beads on the brim of his hat and runs in clean lines down his coat. Up close you catch the scent of clove smoke—cover for something sharper underneath.\n\n“Whose list?” he repeats, like it’s a joke that isn’t funny. “Meridian’s, dressed up in Guild ink. Names that ‘need correcting.’ People that make policies… complicated.”\n\nWhen you ask what he is, his eyes flick toward the soup line where the patrolman is still barking for paperwork. Then back to you.\n\n“I’m the part that keeps tonight from turning into a street fight,” he says. “Call me a mediator.”\n\nHe shifts his weight—subtle—and you realize he’s positioned so he can see both the side door and the street corner. Not protecting you. Controlling angles.\n\nBehind you, the side door latch clicks again from inside—Sister Calwen throwing an extra bolt. Whatever route she’s using, she’s committing to it.\n\nDown the block, the second man reaches the mouth of the alley behind Saint Brigid. He doesn’t go in right away. He pauses, looks up at the church’s rear windows, then slips into the darkness. A moment later, you hear a soft metallic scrape—like a trash lid being eased, not kicked.\n\nThe brass-token man watches your face as if he expects you to run for the alley. “If you go back there,” he says softly, “you’ll meet someone who doesn’t flash anything before he works.”\n\nAcross the line, the patrolman’s voice rises again: “No papers? Then step out. Now.” You hear a small protest, a chair leg skittering on wet stone, and the volunteer with the ladle says, “Officer, please—”\n\nThe brass-token man takes one step closer—close enough that you can see the faint scar at the corner of his mouth. “You’re Lena Marrow,” he says, not asking. “Meridian already left a card at your office this morning. That means they’re not hunting blind anymore. So: walk away from Saint Brigid tonight, or you’ll force the Sister to choose between her people and you.”\n\nHe tilts his head toward the street, where the patrolman is starting to pull someone out of line by the sleeve. “And you’ve got about ten seconds before that turns ugly.”"

Instead he reaches into his coat slowly, like he’s giving you time to decide whether to panic, and produces a folded card stock—thick, expensive. He holds it up just long enough for you to see a blind-embossed mark: **MERIDIAN ASSURANCE COMBINE**. No name, no title. Just a policy-number string stamped in black at the bottom. Then it’s back in his pocket.\n\n“I answer to the paper,” he says. “Same as everyone else.”\n\nFrom the alley mouth behind Saint Brigid, you see movement: the man who slipped in is no longer alone. A second figure steps into view behind him—shorter, shoulders squared, cap pulled low. They don’t rush. They position themselves: one near the trash bins, one near the rear wall, both watching the church’s back windows and the side door. One of them has something in his hand that catches the streetlamp for a blink—metal, narrow. A tool, or a blade.\n\nYour call to the side door gets an answer, but not from the door. It comes from a grated basement window set into the church foundation, a few feet from the steps.\n\nSister Calwen’s voice, tight and controlled: “I’m here. Stop calling my name.”\n\nA pause—then, quieter: “Yes. There’s a way through. But if they hear where, it becomes a trap.”\n\nThe patrolman swings his head toward you, eyes narrowing. “Marrow,” he says, like a warning. He lets go of the woman’s sleeve and steps toward you instead, hand hovering near his baton. “You obstructing an inquiry? Because I can make that official.”\n\nThe brass-token man shifts half a step—placing himself so he can block the patrolman’s line to you if it comes to it, while still keeping the alley in his peripheral. “This is how it starts,” he murmurs. “Noise. Then bodies.”\n\nYou now have two clear threats: the patrolman escalating in front, and two men setting up behind the church—watching for any exit Calwen uses."

Papers.” His tone says he’s punishing the whole line for your interference.\n\nAt the basement grate, there’s a faint scrape—something heavy sliding over stone. Calwen doesn’t answer you with words. She answers with action: the volunteer with the ladle suddenly pivots, blocking the patrolman’s view of the church steps with her body and a sloshing pot, while another volunteer “accidentally” knocks over a crate of stale rolls, drawing eyes and curses. It’s clumsy on purpose. Cover.\n\nIn that same beat, the thin woman the patrolman had yanked is guided—not pushed, guided—back into the press of bodies and then sideways toward the church wall. She disappears behind the volunteers’ skirts and the steam off the soup pot. No one sees a door open. No one sees a door close. She’s just… gone from the line.\n\nBehind Saint Brigid, the alley figures react to the sudden bustle. The shorter one raises a hand once—two fingers, quick—and the man by the bins shifts position to get a better angle on the foundation windows. They’re not “your people” in the sense of obeying you, and they don’t look like they’re taking orders from the brass-token man either.\n\nWhen you press him—call them off or tell you what they’re waiting to catch—his mouth tightens.\n\n“They’re waiting on a mistake,” he says. “A door. A hatch. A face they can swear they recognized.”\n\nHe glances past you at the patrolman. “And he’s waiting for you to make one.”\n\nThe patrolman snaps, loud enough for the block to hear: “Nobody moves off that line unless I say so.” He steps closer to the church steps, trying to reassert control of the space you just helped Calwen blur.\n\nThe brass-token man leans in, voice barely above the rain: “If you keep standing here, you become the reason they search the church. If you leave, you become the reason the alley men follow.”\n\nConcrete threat, now: the patrolman is about to order a search of Saint Brigid’s entrance area, and the two in the alley are poised to intercept anyone exiting through a low route along the foundation."

Produce rolls out, wet paper wrapping tearing. People jump back; one dockhand curses and grabs his shin. A wagon driver yanks his reins, shouting as a wheel splashes through a puddle and clips the crate—wood splinters snap and skid.\n\nThe commotion does what you want—half the line’s attention snaps away from the church steps. Two volunteers surge forward, scolding and shooing bodies back from the street. For a moment, the church entrance area is less watched.\n\nBut it also gives the patrolman an excuse to move.\n\n“Clear that!” he snaps, and steps off his post toward the street mess—close enough now that he can see along the church wall and the steps again.

A **second man** steps in—different from the first tail, heavier build, hands bare despite the cold. He doesn’t browse. He just stands by the door, blocking the easiest exit without making it look like he’s blocking it.\n\nThreat, plain: you’re now **contained in the shop**—one watcher inside “shopping,” one inside on the door, and at least one set of eyes outside coordinating.

One jar bursts on the floor with a wet crack—pickled something—spreading slick brine across the boards right where the baton-man needs to step. He checks himself again, forced to hop to keep his footing, and for a heartbeat he’s more worried about falling than advancing.\n\nRusk keeps crawling, whistle still screaming; his free hand claws at the floorboards, dragging him past the counter’s open end. The clerk, wide-eyed and shaking, gets a shoulder against a low shelf near the doorway—partial cover.\n\nYou reach back and stomp.\n\nYour heel comes down on the pale hand pushing through the hatch gap. You feel bones shift under your boot. The intruder yowls—high and furious—and tries to yank free.\n\nHe doesn’t. Not immediately.\n\nBut the hatch is up enough now that he can use his other arm and tool leverage from outside. The torn hinge side flexes again. Your weight pins the hand, but the whole hatch begins to **lift around** your boot, prying up like a jaw.\n\nAt the doorway, the heavy man shifts his aim to the crawling bodies and barks, “Don’t let ’em out!”\n\nHe fires again—low. The shot punches into the floorboards near Rusk’s trailing leg, splintering wood and making Rusk flinch so hard his whistle cuts out into a gagging cough.\n\nThe baton-man, seeing the opening, commits: he slides one boot through the brine and comes in anyway, baton raised again—this time not for the clerk, but angling toward **you**, over the counter line.\n\nBehind you, the pinned hand twists, and you feel something sharp scrape your boot sole—like a small blade or hook trying to cut leather or catch an ankle.\n\n**Immediate threats:** baton-man closing to strike you; gunman now shooting to stop escape; hatch lifting under you while the intruder works a sharp tool against your boot/ankle to break your pin."

He’s found a **meat tenderizer**—short handle, heavy head—likely dropped from the earlier struggle, and he grips it like he’s afraid his hand will fail.\n\nAt the doorway, boots splash—someone is trying to push in, but the gunman is still there, trading angles. The immediate threat is the hook-blade man about to round the counter end and look down into your cover.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"glass bottle (spirits)\",\"steel can-opener\",\"thin metal skewer\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```"

Not cutting—just enough pressure that he feels the edge find skin. His throat works. He goes still, breathing through his nose, eyes locked on you with a mix of hate and calculation. No more wriggling.\n\nRusk fumbles his coat open with shaking fingers and pulls your hand to the right side of his belly, just above the beltline. There’s a shrapnel cut—ragged and ugly, bleeding steady rather than spurting.

Rusk grits his teeth and nods, trying not to make a sound.\n\nAt the doorway, your whisper carries. A patrolman answers low, voice tight: “No shield. We’ve got one man down—bleeding bad.” Another one says, “Copy: holding.”\n\nThen something changes outside: not gunfire—*quiet*. Footsteps stop splashing. The rain noise feels suddenly louder because the street goes still.\n\nA faint, almost musical *ting* rides the air from just beyond the threshold—like a wire under tension being tapped.\n\nAnd then, from the downspout just outside the door, a short metallic cough: *pfft-CHUNK*.\n\nA capsule bursts at ankle height, flashing white through the smoke-haze and spitting a fan of wet dye across the doorway and floor. Blue, unnaturally clean—like neon paint in rain. Droplets pepper the tile and the lower edge of the counter, and a spray catches your trouser leg and the side of your coat.\n\nThe patrolman at the door swears, “What the hell—?

Down in the wall.”\n\nA pause. The kind where men decide whether they’re imagining things.\n\nThen: a hard knock on brick, close to the hatch—someone rapping the wall with the butt of a tool, listening for hollow. Another knock, closer to where the panel is mortared over.\n\n“Here,” the rough voice says. “This patch—fresh.”\n\nMetal grinds against masonry: they’ve got something—crowbar or chisel—worrying at the mortar from the storage-room side.\n\nYou keep moving. The cold draft strengthens as the run bends slightly; the brick under your left hand changes—slicker, with a strip of old mortar like a repair line. Ahead, the passage tightens for a few feet, then you see a darker vertical seam: a junction where the run meets an older conduit, narrower but drier.\n\nBehind you, a sharp *crack*—mortar breaking free. The iron panel doesn’t open yet, but it shifts with a dull, transmitted vibration through the bricks you’re touching.\n\nRusk’s breathing goes shallow as you murmur your instruction.

He’s not stupid. “No,” he mutters, and you hear him angle forward again, quicker, hook low.\n\nYou crawl to where Rusk cursed and reach out into the dark with your left hand.\n\nYour fingers find the lip: the conduit floor breaks into a short drop, about two feet, with a slick edge that’s been worn rounded. Past it, the passage kinks sharply left. On the right wall at the corner there’s a corroded pipe running along the bend—wet, slimy, and slightly loose in its mounts. When you touch near it, it shivers faintly, and you feel why Rusk warned you: it isn’t solid enough to take weight.\n\nYou press yourself flat against the wall just before the drop, hook-blade up and ready, making yourself small.\n\nThe pursuer arrives at the choke. His lantern-less silhouette is a darker shape against the faint, dirty glow behind him. He slows at the edge, hook hand up, listening for breath.\n\nThen he does something worse than rushing: he lowers the hook head over the lip and lets it hang, cable paying out quietly. He’s fishing the drop and the left turn by feel, trying to snag whatever’s below without exposing himself.\n\nThe hook head swings once… twice… and starts drifting toward the pipe at the corner. If it catches that loose pipe, it’ll clang and possibly tear free—noise that gives you away *and* could block the bend.\n\nYou have a moment: the hook/cable is within reach, and the pipe is about to get involved."

The hook head dips under your control, and you guide it down toward the stone under-ledge instead of the loose pipe.\n\nThe pursuer feels the change immediately. The cable stops “talking” in his hand.\n\nHe freezes, then gives a short testing tug.\n\nYou’re ready for that: you wedge the hook head under the ledge so it catches stone. The line locks. When he tugs again, it answers with a hard, dead resistance—like it’s snagged on masonry, not flesh.\n\n“Damn it,” he whispers, annoyed more than alarmed. He shifts his stance at the edge, preparing to haul it free.\n\nThat’s your window.\n\nYou ease yourself over the drop. Your boots hit the lower floor with a slick *thup* you can’t fully hide, but the bend steals the sound.

The wedged hook holds for half a second—then your wrap around the hook-blade slips a fraction on the wet wire. The line grinds, squeals faintly, and the hook head tears free of the stone with a harsh *scrape*.\n\n“Hey!” the man snaps, now certain someone’s been on his gear. You hear him drop down after it—boots hitting the lower level—and the cable zips as he gathers it in.\n\nThreat is immediate and closing: he’s over the drop and coming around the left bend with the hook retracted, moving fast and now hunting by certainty instead of guesswork.

You hear his boot scrape the wall and the cable hiss as he pulls it close, ready to strike blind.\n\nYou kick the loose pipe mount.\n\nThe corroded bracket gives with a sharp *ping* and the whole pipe lurches outward on its remaining clamp, swinging into the bend like a drunken arm. It doesn’t explode or spray—no steam—just a sudden, heavy swing and a nasty metallic rattle that fills the turn.\n\nThe pursuer flinches exactly like you want—throws a forearm up and checks his step.

His hook scrapes sparks off stone as he catches himself.\n\n“Son of a—!” he snarls, more furious now than cautious.\n\nBut the pipe keeps moving. The half-free mount drags and the pipe drops lower, scraping the floor.

You drag him past the bend and into deeper dark, the floor narrowing and pitching slightly downward. Your palms hit slime; your knees find broken grit. Rusk’s breathing turns ragged—he’s hurt or winded—but he keeps moving.\n\nBehind you, the hook-man recovers fast.

You follow tight behind, hook-blade scraping along the right-hand masonry in short, controlled strokes.\n\nThe scrape tells you what your eyes can’t: rough brick and mortar at first—then, a few feet on, the blade kisses something smooth and cold protruding from the wall: a thin metal strap or conduit clip. You lift the blade off it immediately and shift your line even closer to the stone, palms careful, fingers spread to avoid anything wet.\n\nThe floor changes texture under your knees—wetter, with a slick film that pulls at fabric.

He catches himself with a curse—“Shit!”—and his hook head clacks once as it taps the floor.\n\nBut he doesn’t go down. He slows, adjusts, and starts coming again—more careful now, dragging the hook low like a feeler.\n\nRusk keeps you on the drier right edge, but the “dry” is relative: the right wall is crumbling and narrow here, and the wet film is creeping across it in streaks.

You drive your forearm into the hook’s shaft and pin it against your hook-blade, turning his leverage into a cramped wrestle.\n\nHe tries to wrench free anyway—shoulders bunching, elbows flaring—but your stomp lands on his forward shin/boot edge with a solid, ugly *crack*.\n\nHe barks out a sound that’s half pain, half fury, and his stance buckles. The hook dips; the point scrapes stone and sparks once as it kisses the wet lip.\n\nYou get your heartbeat of space.\n\nYou back into the base of the ladder, keeping the blade between you and him, and set your hand on the lowest rung to start up.\n\nHe recovers faster than you’d like. Limping, he changes tactics: instead of pulling, he swings the hook head sideways at knee height, aiming to catch the ladder upright itself—either to yank you off as you climb or to rattle Rusk above.\n\nThe hook catches the ladder’s side rail with a metallic *CLONK* and he hauls.\n\nThe whole ladder shudders. Your grip slips a fraction on the wet rung, and above you Rusk curses as his boots skid on the rung he’s braced on. The hatch lip overhead gives a little—metal squealing—then stops, still mostly jammed.\n\nImmediate threat: if the hook-man gets a second solid pull on the ladder rail, it’ll wrench you off-balance at the base and could peel Rusk off his rung above; either of you could fall—into each other or off the lip toward the live trench.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```"

The wedge splits. The hook shifts, loses its “tooth,” and scrapes down the rail in a shower of tiny sparks.\n\nThe hook-man has to let go for a half-second to keep from losing the tool entirely.

There’s still a hand-wide gap on one side.\n\nYou jam your hook-blade through the gap, catching it under a corroded crossbar/hasp nub on the frame. Metal squeals as you lever the blade sideways to bite. It holds—barely—your grip vibrating with each tremor from below.\n\n“Rusk—help me wedge it, then we move; no hero stuff.”\n\nRusk is already there, breathing hard, face pale in the dim. He nods once and snatches a loose chunk of tarred board from the floor. “Yeah. Yeah—no hero.” He slams the board edge-first into the gap above your blade, hammering it with the heel of his hand until it wedges tight.\n\nFrom below: the hook-man hits the ladder rungs hard—fast climbing.

It scrapes your sleeve, missing skin by an inch, and catches the wedged board instead. He yanks. The board shifts a finger-width.\n\nRusk grabs the board with both hands and shoves it back in, snarling, “Stay DOWN there!”\n\nThe hook-man answers with a wet laugh that turns into a cough.

Salt grit clings to their hairline. Their hand comes up fast, fingers splayed, not to grab you—more like to shield their face from the blade.\n\n“Don’t,” you warn. “I’ll pin you to the joists.”\n\nThe kid freezes, breath fluttering. “Please—don’t—” Their voice is hoarse, drug-thick. “They’re behind me.”\n\nBehind them: a second sound, closer and heavier than the tapping—a controlled scrape of boots on a rung or narrow ladder under the patch. Someone else is coming up the same access, using the kid as the first body through.\n\nAt the hatch, the hook-man changes tactics. There’s a hard *clank* as he hooks something solid—your packed seam shifts, not much, but enough that the hatch plate bumps upward a fraction. Rusk grunts as the pressure tries to peel him off it. “He’s got purchase—Lena—!”\n\nUnder your blade, the kid’s eye darts sideways in panic as a shadow crowds them from below.

You’ve bought seconds, not safety.\n\nRusk moves when you hiss. He keeps low, feeling along the tarred boards and studs in the upper service space, hands patting for seams and fasteners. He finds a narrow maintenance crawl to your right—too tight for a quick scramble, but it’s there—and a rusted ring-bolt set into a beam.\n\nHe whispers back, barely audible: “Crawl run—right side. Tight. Ring-bolt here—could lash something. No fuel. Smells like tar and dust only.”\n\nBelow, Ed shifts—careful now, less pressure on the patch. “If they breach, they’ll come for you first. They’ve got your name.”\n\nAt the hatch, the heavier man rams again—harder. The jam audibly fractures. One more solid hit and the opening will clear enough for fingers.\n\n**Immediate threat:** two Guild “safety” men are forcing the hatch; the jam is cracking and will likely fail within moments. Ed is pinned below the patch and could shove at any time if panic or opportunity hits."

The leather bites; the buckle clicks; the hatch lid jerks downward an inch as the strap takes tension.\n\n“Move,” he breathes, and snakes into the right-side crawl on his elbows, boots scraping tar as he goes.\n\nYou drive the hook-blade into the gap and twist.\n\nThe next shoulder-ram comes like a battering wave. Wood shrieks. Your hook-blade catches the lip and turns the impact into a long, grinding pry—exactly what you wanted—except the sound is worse: a sustained, tearing scream of wood and metal that broadcasts your position.\n\nBelow, the hook-man curses, close and sharp. “They’ve got a brace in it—cut it. CUT IT.”\n\nSomething thin and metallic bites up into the gap from below—his hook tool, now used like a saw against the strap. You feel the vibration through the hatch frame. The belt holds for a moment, then the leather starts to fuzz and give.\n\nEd hears your warning. His voice drops, and there’s a quick shuffle below as he drags someone back from the opening. A smaller set of feet scuffs away; a stifled whimper gets swallowed. “Kid’s back,” Ed says. “I’m not touching it.”\n\nYou keep your knee planted on the patch until the last possible second, then slide off and into the right-side crawl. It’s tight—shoulders scraping, cheek against gritty brick. Behind you, the patch immediately rises a fraction with the relief of your weight, but it doesn’t blow; Ed keeps still.\n\nThen the belt gives with a wet snap.\n\nThe hatch pops up a handspan before the hook-blade, still jammed, torques and spits free. A gloved hand snakes in, fingers clawing for purchase. Light from below knifes into the service space in a hard rectangle, and a voice follows it—hook-man, satisfied: “There. Got you.”\n\nYou are in the crawl, moving, but they now have an open gap and line of sight into the upper space you just left, and they know exactly which way you went.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[\"belt (taken from wounded man)\"],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Right-side maintenance crawl (tight)\"],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```"

Heard air moving.”\n\nBehind you, the hatch space you left coughs sound into the conduit: a man hauling himself up, boots finding purchase, metal scraping brick. Not running yet—careful. They don’t want to get stuck.\n\nYou sweep the walls and ceiling with your free hand as you crawl. Most of it is old brick and patched mortar, damp and slick. Then your fingers catch something that isn’t masonry: a narrow, corroded sheet-metal access cover set into the right wall, about the size of a ledger, held by two bent tabs. It’s already loose—someone’s been in here before.\n\nYou hook your fingertips under the edge and yank. The cover peels free with a sharp metallic rasp that echoes down the crawl like a shout. Rusk freezes, then keeps going faster.\n\nYou twist and jam the sheet-metal panel crosswise in the crawl behind you, wedging it between brick and ceiling. It holds—barely—bowing in the middle. It won’t stop a determined man, but it will force them to slow, to wriggle and curse and make noise.\n\nImmediately, a gloved hand smacks into it from the far side. The panel flexes with a booming clang. A voice—closer now, breathy with the squeeze—spits, “They threw a plate. Get a light up here.”\n\nAnother thud. The panel shudders; one tab starts to slip, scraping mortar dust into your hair.\n\nRusk reaches the junction ahead—an older conduit intersection where the space opens enough to turn your shoulders. “Here,” he hisses. “Drop’s right there—don’t look down too long.”\n\nYou’ve bought seconds, not safety.

Two men, somewhere off to the left at the bottom or in an adjacent run—words swallowed by brick, but the cadence is casual. They’re already down there.\n\nRusk doesn’t hesitate. He slips onto the ladder and starts down fast, keeping his shoulders tight to the rails. “I’ll call it,” he whispers.\n\nYou snatch the sheet-metal panel and wedge it harder at the crawl mouth. It bites for half a second—then something on the other side rams it with a shoulder. The panel bows with a deep gong, and one edge skates, shaving mortar. A hand hooks over the top, fingers curling, trying to peel it back.\n\nNo more time.\n\nYou swing onto the ladder and descend, body close, boots finding rungs by feel. Above, metal shrieks as the panel gets dragged aside a few inches. A harsh voice barks, right at the opening now: “DOWN. They went down—”\n\nRusk reaches the last third of the ladder and pauses just long enough to look. His head jerks back up. “Two—” he starts to say.\n\nA flashlight beam snaps on below, stabbing up the shaft. It catches Rusk’s face, then yours, bleaching you both in hard white. A man’s voice carries clearly now, close and surprised: “Hey! Up there!”\n\nRusk drops the last few rungs in a controlled slide and hits the bottom with a wet slap of boots on slime-slick brick. He turns sideways, making room, one hand up like he’s about to grab your ankle and yank you down.\n\nYou’re still on the ladder, halfway into the light, with the “Safety” men above forcing into the junction and at least two men below now alerted and aiming a beam straight up the drop.

The man yelps and jerks back, more startled than hurt.\n\nBut the blade’s return arc kisses skin on the way back up—there’s a sharp, wet sound and a quick shout. “Ah—shit! My hand!”\n\nYou don’t wait to see more. You clamp your forearms to the rails and slide the last stretch, boots skidding the rungs, then drop the final couple feet into a crouch beside Rusk. The floor is brick, slimed with algae; your landing splashes cold water up your shins.\n\n“Left,” you hiss.\n\nRusk is already moving. He grabs your sleeve and pulls you into a low run along the left-hand runnel where the conduit opens into a wider service passage—pipes overhead, a cable tray along the wall, and a dangling chain that ticks as you brush past.\n\nBehind you, the man you disarmed scrambles for the fallen flashlight. Another voice—different, steadier—barks, “Don’t chase blind. Get the light. Get the light!”\n\nAbove, boots hit the ladder. The upper “Safety” man starts down fast, rungs clanging.

You plant your shoulder, crank hard.\n\nIt gives with a reluctant groan—and then *hisses*. Not steam. Pressurized water. A hard, sideways jet spits from a cracked coupling further down the pipe run, turning the passage into a cold, white spray that catches the flashlight beam like fog. The floor immediately turns to glass.\n\nBehind you, one of the men swears as his beam turns into glare. “Goddamn—watch your—” A boot slips; there’s a sharp skid and a knee hits brick. “—SHIT!”\n\nThe pursuing light wobbles, then steadies lower, trying to cut under the spray. The man with the hurt hand is breathing loud now, angry and close, but he’s slower—favoring it.\n\nRusk leans in as you keep moving, voice tight. “Cross-passage in twenty feet—right. It’s narrower. Dead-ends after a bend, but there’s a service recess—two men could tuck in, maybe ten seconds if they don’t sweep it right.” He points with two fingers without lifting his head. “Or—there’s a ladder up at the end of this run, but it’s exposed.”\n\nA flashlight beam stabs through the water haze again, lower this time, searching for feet.

Third man: the one from above, moving like he’s been in these runs before—his light doesn’t wander; it *checks*.\n\nThey pass the mouth of your cross-passage.\n\nThen the third man stops dead.\n\nHis beam snaps sideways into the right-hand opening—straight down your cross-passage.
