Neon from the sign bleeds through the front curtains, and the air behind the stage smells of powder, sweat, and spilled gin. Outside, a siren starts and dies.\n\nYou sit at your dressing table with one shoe off, garter loosened, working the stocking down your calf as if you’re only fixing a snag. The mirror bulbs buzz. Your stage lipstick is still perfect, but your hands are steady in the way they were in the tenement—steady because shaking never bought you mercy. The torn **ledger page** stays flat against your skin until you slide it into your palm and read the columns again: dates, amounts, names you’ve heard men whisper about.\n\nA knock comes—two quick taps, one slow—then the door opens without waiting. It’s **Lena**, the cigarette girl, cheeks flushed from running. She doesn’t look at your face; she looks at your hands. “Halden,” she says, and pushes a matchbook onto your table like it’s a tip. Inside, in tight pencil: **RAID. VICE BUREAU. TEN MINUTES. GET OUT. DON’T LET THEM TAKE YOU.** Under it, another line: **They asked about you by name.**\n\nBefore you can move, a man you’ve never seen steps into the doorway behind Lena as if he belongs there. Clean coat, no club stamp on his wrist, and a pale key-pin on his lapel—the same marrow-white symbol that marks your page. He sets a small case on the chair and says, calm as a banker, “New papers. New name. One delivery to a chalk-marked basement on Harker Street. Tonight.”\n\nThe hallway fills with footsteps and the distant bark of a whistle. You have the page, the warning, and the case in the same room, and every option has a price.",

He closes the dressing-room door with two fingers, not latching it—just enough to muffle the hall. Then he takes a step in, keeping his hands where you can see them.\n\n“Miracles don’t come cheap,” he says. His voice is educated, careful about it. “I’m not Vice. I’m not Saints. I’m sent by Mr. Ketteridge’s office.” The name lands like a calling card—Marrow Society money, the kind that buys judges and riverfront blocks.\n\nHe nods at the key-pin when you tilt your chin. “That pin is my receipt. It means if I’m found in pieces, someone important asks why.”\n\n“What’s in the case?” you press.\n\nHe doesn’t open it. He taps the lid once. “Documents. A birth certificate that doesn’t exist yet, a work card that already has stamps, and a letter of employment with a real company that will swear you’ve been on payroll for six months. Enough to walk through a station house without anyone deciding you’re worth holding.” His eyes flick briefly to your bare thigh before he looks away, like he’s marking where you keep things. “And something else. Sealed. Not for me.”\n\nLena shifts near the mirror, wringing her hands. “Eve—” she starts, but a hard rap hits the outer door to the backstage corridor, not yours—someone checking rooms.\n\nA male voice barks down the hall: “Vice Bureau—everybody out front! Dressing rooms next!”\n\nThe Marrow man lowers his voice. “Harker Street. Basement door with fresh chalk marks—surveyors’ marks. You take the case there. You hand it through. You don’t look inside the sealed packet if you value your eyes.”\n\nAnother set of footsteps—closer now—stops right outside your dressing-room door.

The Marrow man watches your hands like he’s counting seconds.\n\nYou snap the mirror bulbs off. The room drops into a dim gray, lit only by spill from the hallway. The stage-side panel—an old service hatch in the far wall—gives with a soft crack of dry wood as you ease it open. Cold air and the faint throb of sax and crowd noise seep through.\n\nIn the hallway, a fist hits your door—once, impatient.\n\n“Open up,” a man says, close enough that you can hear his breath. “Vice Bureau.”\n\nYou hiss at the Marrow man about Halden. He answers without heat, low and quick: “Halden isn’t running this. If he shows his face tonight, it’s to look useful—or to keep a certain file from walking. He’s in danger either way.”\n\nHe moves when you order him—quiet, but not graceful. His shoe scuffs the floorboard, a small sound that nonetheless seems enormous in the dark.\n\nThe knob turns again, harder this time.\n\n“Last chance,” the voice says.\n\nYou slip through the panel first, shoulder scraping the frame. The space beyond is a narrow service run behind the stage flats—painted canvas, ropes, and dust. You can see through a slit between curtains: the club floor is still full, but the mood has shifted—heads turning toward the front, people standing too fast.\n\nBehind you, the Marrow man squeezes for the hatch—\n\n—and at that exact moment the dressing-room door latch snaps with a sharp crack. The door swings inward, flooding the room with hallway light.\n\nA Vice Bureau officer fills the doorway, hat brim low, baton in hand. He takes in the dead bulbs, the open hatch, and Lena by the mirror like she’s been caught mid-prayer.\n\n“There,” he says, and points straight at the panel. “They’re going out the back.”\n\nBoots start running.\n\nYou are in the service run with the case.

You scoop a fistful and fling.\n\nIt hits him square across the eyes and nose. He jerks back with a strangled curse, baton clattering against the doorframe as he claws at his face. “God—!” He staggers, blinking hard, tears cutting white tracks through the powder.\n\nLena uses the half-second like she was born for it—she ducks under his arm and bolts into the hall, skirts up, moving fast and silent.\n\nYou hook your fingers in the Marrow man’s coat and haul.

Pain flashes hot down your arm, but nothing breaks; it’s a glancing hit meant to stop you, not kill you.\n\n“Eddie—move!” you snap.\n\nThe Marrow courier lunges for the door when you shove him.

Powder-smoke blooms in the tight space, sharp and sour. The man grunts, surprised more than hurt, and his free hand slams into your shoulder to pin you back against the seat.\n\nOutside, Vice sees the muzzle flash through the window and answers with instinct: two shots crack into the sedan’s body—one spiderwebs the rear side glass, spraying cubes across the seatback; the other pings off the door frame near your elbow. Tiny shards bite your cheek and forearm.\n\n“Ink-fingered bastard—drive,” you snarl, shoving his wrist higher, forcing the barrel away from you.\n\nHe doesn’t fight you like a club bruiser. He twists with practiced economy, turning his forearm so your grip loses leverage, then he headbutts forward—hard. Your vision bursts white at the edges as his forehead clips your brow. Not a knockout, but enough to loosen your hands.\n\n“Driver!” he snaps, voice flat. “MOVE.”\n\nUp front, the driver—another man, broad shoulders under a slicker—drops the sedan into gear. Tires spin on wet cobbles, then catch. The car surges.\n\nAs it lurches, the passenger rips his gun arm free and shoves the pistol muzzle down between the seats toward you again, close enough you can smell oil on the metal.\n\n“You’re in my car,” he says, teeth tight. “You do *exactly* what I say.”\n\nThe sedan fishtails past the skittered Marrow case. In the side mirror you catch it for an instant: the Saints enforcer scoops it up one-handed, ignoring the Vice officer’s shouted orders. Eddie is still plastered to the brick shadow, staring after you like you just jumped off a pier.\n\nVice fires again—one last shot that cracks the trunk lid as you pull away—then the alley folds into fog and speed.\n\nYou are in a moving sedan with two Marrow men: driver in front, armed passenger beside you with a pistol inches from your ribs. The Vice and Saints are behind, and Eddie is left in the alley.",

Field side.”\n\nThe driver takes a hard right without being told, tires hissing, the sedan’s rear end stepping out before it straightens. Water fans off the wheels. Streetlamps smear into long yellow lines across the wet glass.\n\n“Lose the tail,” you say.\n\nThe passenger flicks two fingers toward the windshield. “Rook—river road.”\n\nRook doesn’t answer. He just drives like he’s angry at the city: another turn, tighter, then a sudden brake-and-go that snaps your shoulder against the seat.

Service lanes. Fish sheds,” Sable snaps, and for the first time there’s heat in his voice. “Chain gap.”\n\nRook’s head tilts a fraction, like he’s checking a map only he can see. Then the sedan veers left, not toward the open river road but into the dock grid—narrower streets, stacked crates, black puddles, and the stink of brine and diesel. He kills the headlights without slowing. The world outside becomes silhouettes: gantry cranes like praying mantises, warehouse doors like shut mouths.\n\nBehind you, the Saints’ car doesn’t follow the turn clean. Its headlights sweep past the intersection—overshooting—then brake lights flare red in the fog as it corrects.\n\n“Now,” you hiss. “Swap direction.”\n\nRook doesn’t. Not yet.\n\nHe takes you deeper first—two quick turns that put you between fish sheds and a fenced service lane. Up ahead, the chain gap you remember is there… but it isn’t empty.\n\nTwo dock sentries stand by the break in the chain, cigarettes glowing. One lifts a hand, palm out, as the sedan rolls toward them dark. The other’s coat bulges at the hip—gun.\n\nRook brakes hard. The sedan noses down. Your stomach lurches.\n\nSable’s pistol comes up again, not at you—toward the windshield. “Don’t,” he warns, more to Rook than to you.\n\nThe sentry with the cigarette steps forward, squinting into the dark. “Who’s there?” he calls. “You’re not supposed to—”\n\nBehind, the Saints’ headlights bloom at the far end of the lane, closer now, sweeping between sheds as they hunt the turn you made.\n\nYou’re boxed in: chain gap guarded ahead, Saints closing behind, and you’re sitting in a dark sedan with a Marrow gun raised.\n\nSable leans close enough that you can smell his breath—peppermint trying to cover fear. “Marrow wants the page because it proves the Vice Bureau’s pay list,” he says, clipped. “Names.

Flat. “Not unless you want everyone to hear it.”\n\nYour line about tunnel permits lands wrong—too sharp, too accurate. The cigarette sentry’s face tightens; he takes a half-step back from the car like he suddenly expects it to explode.\n\nThe armed sentry raises his chin toward the lane behind you. “Saints are already here,” he says, and there’s no sympathy in it. “So either you’re a fool… or you’re bait.”\n\nBehind, the Saints’ headlights sweep the mouth of the service lane and pause—searching. You hear an engine idle, then the crunch of tires on gravel as their car creeps forward. A door opens. A man’s voice carries, low and amused: “Found you.”\n\nThe armed sentry makes a quick, ugly choice: he yanks the chain up and hooks it higher—opening the gap wider—but he doesn’t wave you through.

His pistol tracks away from you and toward the rear window.\n\nBehind, the Saints’ headlights catch the sentries in the lane. The armed sentry throws his arm up like he owns the road. “Hold it! Authorized—” he barks.\n\nA Saints voice answers, closer than it should be: “Authorized by who?”\n\nThen a shot cracks—sharp, flat. The armed sentry jerks and folds at the waist, dropping out of the headlights like a marionette with cut strings.

One of the Saints drops behind a piling, the shotgun man flinching aside as pellets don’t come—just the threat.\n\nBut the Saints recover fast. A second later the shotgun barks anyway, not at you directly but into the shed wall—wood explodes into splinters that whip past the car like angry insects.

Along the far wall, half-hidden by crates, there’s a heavy interior door with fresh chalk markings like the one outside—survey lines and a crude key symbol. A thin line of light shows under it, like there’s a lit space beyond.\n\nImmediate threat: Saints are moving to flank the warehouse exterior and will likely try to enter through the window after you; you’re bleeding from fresh cuts and inside an unfamiliar basement with one deeper door that looks recently used.\n\n```json\n{\"locations_add\":[\"Warehouse basement — broken window entry\",\"Warehouse basement — interior chalk-marked door\"],\"npcs_add\":[],\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[]}\n```",

Unscheduled.”\n\nThe woman appears at the far end of the corridor: dark hair pinned up, sleeves rolled, a lantern in one hand and a shotgun in the other. She takes in the three of you, the blood, the wet, the street stink, and she doesn’t ask questions—she just angles the shotgun toward the door.\n\nOutside, the Saints change tactics. Instead of another body-check, you hear metal on metal: the rasp of something being set, then a hollow *thunk* against the door—like a clamp or a wedge. The prying stops for a second.\n\nThe woman with the shotgun swears under her breath. “They’re going to spike it and peel the bolt out.”\n\nThe key-pin man finally speaks to your offer. “You want past? Fine.” He jerks his chin down the corridor. “You walk. Slow. Hands where I can see. Your friend with the cut goes in the middle.”\n\nThen, to you, quieter: “And you tell me who paid Crowley while we move. If I don’t like the answer, I don’t have to hand you back to them. I can put you in the river tunnel myself.”\n\nHe steps aside just enough to let you pass—still covering you—while the woman plants herself near the door, shotgun ready, listening to the Saints working the spike on the other side. The immediate threat is clear: the door is being mechanically defeated, and you have seconds to get deeper before it gives.",

At “Alderman Vance,” he actually blinks—once—and his jaw sets like you’ve confirmed something he didn’t want confirmed.\n\n“Vance,” he says, tasting the name. “That’s a wider net than dock rats.”\n\nBehind you, the door gives a different sound: not a slam, but a stressed *crack*—wood splitting where the spike is biting. The woman with the shotgun—lantern light catching the hard line of her cheek—backs away from the door and starts moving with you, keeping her muzzle trained down the corridor past your shoulders, ready to fire through you if she has to.\n\n“Next door?” she snaps at your question, not sweet, not patient. “There isn’t one. There’s a stair and a choke.”\n\nShe swings the lantern toward a narrow set of stone steps descending into darkness. Chalk marks—survey lines and numbers—crawl along the wall, and the air down there is colder, wetter, threaded with a sour-river draft. A heavy steel gate sits at the bottom, half-open, with a chain and padlock hanging loose like it was just unfastened.\n\nThe key-pin man gestures with the pistol. “Down. Single file.

The bolt doesn’t pop yet, but the Saints have time and leverage.\n\nAs you reach the third step, something clatters from above—small and metallic—skittering along the corridor floor toward the stairwell.\n\nThe woman’s lantern catches it in a hop of light: a little tin cylinder, punched with holes.\n\nHer face changes instantly. “Gas—!”\n\nShe shoves the lantern forward and drops to one knee, shotgun swinging toward the stairwell mouth as if she can shoot the canister back. The key-pin man lunges a half-step, pistol lowering—too late to stop it from rolling.\n\nThe canister hits the top step and hisses, spitting a thin white stream that starts to pour down toward you.\n\nThe threat is immediate and specific: the Saints are pumping gas into the corridor, and it’s flowing down the stairs after you.",

Your eyes sting even through the coat, and your throat tightens on the first involuntary breath.\n\n“Gate!” you bark, and the steel bars at the bottom loom closer—half-open, chain dangling.\n\nAbove, the woman with the lantern snaps a single shotgun blast down at the canister. The shot doesn’t “send it back”—it shreds the top step and sprays pellets into the wall. The canister jumps, dented, but keeps hissing, rolling another half-step and vomiting more gas into the stairwell.\n\n“Down—DOWN!” she coughs, voice already rough, and she retreats two paces, trying to keep her lungs shallow.\n\nThe key-pin man hesitates one fatal second to scoop the canister with his shoe—then thinks better of it and backs off, pistol hand shaking just slightly as the gas reaches his knees. “Move!” he orders, but it’s lost in a rasping cough.\n\nYou get Sable to the gate.

They’ll use it. They’ll—”\n\nA second sound answers: a fist or shoulder slamming the door from within, bracing it. The chain on the far side snaps taut again with a metallic shriek.\n\nThe key-pin man’s jaw tightens. “That’s not Saints,” he mutters—more to himself than you—then he sets the marrow-white key and turns hard.\n\nMetal protests.

The edge nearest the pinch flares up and the sleeve catches; you feel the scorch lick your knuckles as you shove it forward anyway. The path stays open—but only as long as you keep moving it, and your coat is starting to burn.\n\nBehind you, Rook drags Sable higher, shoulder scraping brick. He wedges Sable’s limp body against a protruding mortar seam and keeps Sable’s chin tilted up with one hand. “He’s breathing—barely,” Rook spits, fighting panic.\n\nThe shotgun woman retreats from the pinch, boots splashing through firelight. She tears her own coat off, drops to a knee, and starts beating at the flame’s leading edge. “Keep it off the wall!” she yells, stamping. The fire hisses but keeps crawling around her efforts in thin tongues.\n\nYou slam the door seam.

A Saints voice barks orders over the roar: “Smoke ’em!

Not Saints—wrong kind of panic. He grits out, “Give him—” and hauls Sable deeper into the dark.\n\nYou whirl back and shout your order. Niall nods once—no argument—eyes streaming.\n\nThe Saints’ “shield” comes into view through the smoke: a dock cart turned on its side, iron rim scraping, two men pushing it low like a battering ram.

You fling them low.\n\nThe brick skitters on wet stone and slams into the cart’s leading rim. One pusher’s boot slips; his knee drops hard. The pipe catches a shin with a dull, meaty thunk—he yelps and stumbles sideways, shoulder bumping his partner. The cart slews just enough that its edge kisses the burning spill.\n\nGrease or liquor—whatever’s feeding the flame—licks up the cart’s wood. It catches fast.

Something is wedged in the threshold: the dock cart’s iron rim, shoved into place from the other side as the Saints recover and think faster than they panic.

The vise is bolted down. He tries to heave it anyway—bench legs shriek across the concrete a few inches. “It’s fixed!” he spits, then grabs the bench itself by the corner, knuckles whitening.\n\n“One—two—THREE!”\n\nYou and shirtsleeves hit the door together—shoulder, hip, full weight. The door slams inward against the cart rim with a brutal jolt. For a heartbeat it feels like it might give—\n\nOutside, the Saints answer with muscle. The cart rim screeches as it’s shoved *back* into the threshold. The gap doesn’t close; it *changes shape*. Your bricks bite deeper, and the crooked third brick cracks with a sharp snap, spitting grit into your eyes.\n\nThen the crowbar returns—not prying now, but stabbing. The hooked end punches into the gap and catches the brick edge. Someone outside yanks hard.\n\nThe brick plug tears free and shoots into the room, spinning. It clips shirtsleeves on the temple with a dull *thunk*. He staggers, knees dipping, but he doesn’t fully go down—just blinks stupidly and groans, weight sloughing off the door for an instant.\n\nThat instant is enough.\n\nThe Saints lever again and the gap widens from a slit to a four-inch bite. A hand darts in—fast, blood-smeared fingers reaching to grab the chain hardware.\n\nThe shotgun woman fires once. The blast is deafening in the basement. Pellets shred the reaching hand at the wrist; fingers vanish in a spray that paints the brick and door edge dark. The hand jerks back with a scream that turns into a wet howl.\n\nBut the shot also blows more of the door edge apart. Fresh splinters and a chunk of jamb explode inward, and now the opening is ugly and larger—big enough for a crowbar to work and, soon, a face to risk it.\n\nNiall, eyes watering from smoke and dust, drags the whole workbench toward you instead of the vise. The bench scrapes loud as a confession. “This’ll have to do!” he hacks out.\n\nImmediate threat: the door is still pinned by the cart rim, but the jamb is breaking down under crowbar work and gunfire; the gap is widening, and the Saints are seconds from forcing it enough to push a weapon—or a man—through.",

Fire blossoms low and wide, licking along the floor and up the shield’s face. The crouched Saint jerks back with a strangled curse, losing the shield as it catches. You hear him scramble, boots scraping, patting at his sleeve.\n\nBut the throwback isn’t clean for you, either: the bottle’s burst splashes burning liquor in a fan that reaches the corridor mouth and spits into the room in scattered tongues.

He wedges at the hips for a half-second—breath snagging, a freeze starting—then he forces himself, shoulders twisting. The jagged right-side fang scrapes his coat and skips off your scarf-wrapped hand instead. Niall drops outside with a grunt, then immediately reaches up, palms up, to guide you.\n\nYou clamp the scarf over the worst fang and slam your elbow down on the top edge. The concrete-and-putty lip sheds a few more shards—one skitters down your sleeve, another bounces off the sill and falls into the run. The opening’s a hair cleaner, but it’s still a butcher’s frame.\n\nYou start wriggling through. Half your torso is out into cold fog and rain; your ribs drag the sill. Something catches at your dress seam and tugs—hard—before it tears free with a rip that leaves fabric behind.\n\nBehind you, Rosa hears your count and doesn’t wait for “one.” The Saints at the far end commit the moment they realize you’re going. One of them lunges around the bend, face exposed, teeth bared.\n\nRosa fires exactly once.\n\nThe blast fills the utility run with a flash and a wet, heavy impact. The man’s head snaps back and he folds out of view. Rosa pumps the shotgun—loud, final—and then she runs, boots slipping once on the damp concrete as she sprints toward the window.\n\nBut the Saints answer with something they didn’t need a clean shot for: a glass bottle clinks off pipe and explodes mid-run. A sheet of flame whooshes along the floor, chasing the gas and turning it into a fast, crawling fireline.\n\nHeat punches your legs and the underside of the sill. The air turns instantly harsher—burning, oily.\n\nRosa hits the window just as you’re halfway through. “MOVE!” she barks, and she grabs the back of your dress and shoves—not gentle—trying to get you out before the fire reaches her boots.\n\nOutside, Niall’s hands clamp your forearms, hauling.

The fire in the run has reached the bend; it’s licking along the floor and up the lower pipes, fed by whatever’s leaking down there. The Saints’ boots are close enough now that you can hear breath and the wet slap of leather.\n\nRosa doesn’t drop the shotgun—she tries to bring it with her. She jams the barrel through first, then shoulders, but the weapon catches on the jagged sill and her coat snags at the same torn seam you left behind.\n\nYou lunge up and grab her sleeve. Your scarf-wrapped hand clamps her wrist; the other fist hooks fabric and yanks.\n\nA Saints man appears at the bend, using the smoke and flame as cover. He’s got a revolver up, squinting through the heat shimmer. He fires once toward the window—wild but close. The bullet smacks brick just outside the frame, spitting a chip that cuts your cheek.\n\nRosa flinches, then commits. “To hell with it!” she snarls, and finally lets the shotgun go. It clatters back inside the run with a metallic bounce, immediately haloed by firelight.\n\nWith the weight gone, your pull works. Rosa scrapes through the glass mouth—hard. A shard rakes her forearm; blood flashes dark in the rain. Niall grabs her by the belt and drags, and the three of you tumble together into the mud.\n\nInside, a second shot cracks—another Saint firing blind at the window. The round punches into the frame and whistles out into the fog beyond.\n\nNiall barks at Tommy, “MOVE!” and shoves him along the wall line. Tommy stumbles but runs, hunched, one hand clapped to his torn shoulder.\n\nRosa, breathing fast, clamps her bleeding arm with her other hand. “They’ll come out after us,” she says, eyes flicking to the window. Through the opening, the utility run is now a bright, breathing furnace—and you can hear men coughing, swearing, and repositioning to find the door or another way around.\n\nThe threat is immediate: Saints with firearms are seconds from either firing through the window again or spilling out from another exit to cut you off in the yard.",

He shoves Tommy tight to the brick, one hand on the kid’s collar, steering him in a half-run, half-stagger along the warehouse edge. Tommy keeps trying to drift out into the open without meaning to—pure panic—until Niall yanks him back every time.\n\nFog and rain swallow the yard in pieces. Ten feet out, shapes turn to smudges: stacked pallets, a dead handtruck, a low pile of rope and tarps.

Tommy’s breathing comes out in wet little bursts, but he clamps his mouth shut.\n\nYou put your ear to the personnel door.\n\nOn the other side: nothing—no footsteps, no voices—just the faint creak of a building settling and the distant hiss of rain.

Now you’re in a tight triangle: you and Rosa pinned against the steel hatch that won’t open; Niall a few paces away in the corridor; two Saints at the stairwell mouth—one with a pistol, one with a club and a bad throat—closing the distance.\n\nThe pistol Saint’s gaze flicks to the chalked key mark on the hatch and back to you. “Funny door to die in front of,” he says, and raises the muzzle a little higher.",

He doesn’t retreat—doesn’t advance. He’s stuck.\n\nThe throat-hit Saint closes the remaining distance toward you, eyes wet and furious.

She scrambles on her elbows and knees, keeping her head low like you ordered, and slips through the opening first, disappearing into the dim utility corridor.\n\nYou shove the pistol into Niall’s hand. He catches it clumsy with his injured fingers, winces, then nods once—grim, focused. He ducks through behind Rosa, half-turning immediately to aim down the hall the way you told him, breathing hard as he tries to steady the muzzle.\n\nBehind you, the axe hits again—*WHAM*—and the crate’s side panel caves. Straw and a bottle neck burst through the split. The crate shifts, no longer a solid wedge.\n\nA Saint’s hand punches through the broken wood, grabbing at the grate frame. A face flashes in the gap—cap brim, eyes bright with hate—then a second man crowds behind him with something long and dark: the axe handle.\n\nYou’re still in the room, last like you said, one hand on the torn edge of the door, the other empty. The corridor is open, but you’ve bought it with your gun: you don’t have it now.\n\nFrom the hallway, Niall barks, “Eve—NOW!”\n\nThe Saints don’t wait. The grate heaves outward as the crate collapses inward. The opening widens to a fist, then a forearm. A pistol appears again through the wreckage, searching for a target.\n\nImmediate threat: they have a firing lane into the room and are seconds from getting a man through the grate. You have a clear exit through the steel door, but you must cross the room unarmed while a gun is probing for you.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[\"Saint’s club\"],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

The valve wheel holds, but it’s not pretty—every shove makes it grind and threaten to spit out.\n\nYou kick the hose coil loose. It unspools across the floor with a rubbery slap.\n\nRosa darts in, coughing, and finds the handle—a simple metal pull. She loops the hose around it and then around a short pipe riser by the mop sink, cinching it like a tourniquet. “Hold—hold—” she gasps, yanking until her knuckles whiten. The hose stretches but doesn’t snap.\n\nNiall drags himself backward on his elbows, then gets a knee under him. He brings his pistol up two-handed, barrel angled toward the bottom hinge line like you said—low, ready, shaking from pain and smoke. “I’m up,” he wheezes. “Just—don’t let them—”\n\nOn the other side, the fire finally finds the gap. Smoke pours in around the jamb in a solid stream, and a thin orange lick curls under the door, tasting the utility room floor. The heat coming through is immediate—like an oven door cracked open.\n\nThen something changes: the pounding stops for half a heartbeat, replaced by hurried shouting and a scrape like someone dragging something metal up the stairwell.\n\nThe Vice man’s eyes flick to you. “They’re not kicking anymore,” he says, low. “They’re bringing a tool.”",

The only other way out you can spot is the bulkhead door you came in through… which leads back onto the roof.\n\nYou twist the mop-sink tap.\n\nNothing.\n\nIt gives a dry metallic squeal and spits a single brown cough of air that smells like rust, then goes dead. No pressure.

It’s just rubber in your hands—no water, no weight. “It’s dead,” she says, voice breaking. “No water—Eve—”\n\nOn the other side of the door: metal bites wood. A harsh scraping, then a thunk-thunk like a pry bar testing purchase at the latch.

The thick, riveted supports cut Eddie’s line clean; his rifle barrel tracks, but there’s no shot without stepping wide.\n\nYou wrench at the roof edge and get a fist-sized chunk of tarred brick and gravel. It’s ugly and heavy. You bring it down on the padlock.\n\nFirst strike: a metallic *clang* that rings through the rain.\nSecond: the lock jumps, but holds.\nThird: the chain bites into the hatch handle and sprays rust dust.\n\nRosa and Tommy scramble toward you. Tommy’s breathing is a ragged saw; Rosa is half-dragging him, shoes slipping. They’re still a few strides out.\n\nCrowe closes to within a few yards, then slows—smart. She doesn’t rush into your swing. The pale thing in her hand is clearer now: a short length of fine chain with a weighted end, like a sap made for bones and breath. She keeps it low, ready to snap up.\n\n“You talk pretty when you’re cornered,” she says, voice steady. “Doesn’t change the math.”\n\nYou spit the line about her leash without looking up and keep hammering.\n\nThe padlock finally gives—not cleanly. On the next blow, the shackle twists and cracks, and the lock body splits. The chain slumps loose across the hatch.\n\nAt the exact moment the lock breaks, Eddie steps wide left to re-find an angle around the tank legs. He gets a slice of you—shoulder and head—between iron uprights. He doesn’t take a careful shot. He fires once, quick.\n\nThe bullet whines off iron with a vicious *ping* and throws a hot fleck that stings your upper arm like a cigarette kiss. Not a through-and-through—more a grazing burn and torn fabric—but it jolts you.\n\nCrowe uses the gunshot as cover. She surges in the last steps.\n\nYou scoop a bootful of wet gravel and whip it up. It splatters across her cheek and into one eye. She hisses and turns her face away, blinking hard—but she’s already committed. The weighted chain snaps out anyway, low and fast, aiming for your wrist/hand on the hatch.\n\nRosa reaches the tank legs just as the chain whistles past her shoulder. She yelps and ducks. Tommy drops to his knees, scrambling for the hatch handle with shaking hands.\n\nThe hatch is now unchained and can be opened—but Crowe is in striking distance, Eddie has a partial angle again, and the Saints man with the busted wrist is still somewhere behind you on the roof, not out of this yet.",

Outside, a siren starts and dies.\n\nYou sit at your dressing table with one shoe off, garter loosened, working the stocking down your calf as if you’re only fixing a snag. The mirror bulbs buzz. Your stage lipstick is still perfect, but your hands are steady in the way they were in the tenement—steady because shaking never bought you mercy. The torn **ledger page** stays flat against your skin until you slide it into your palm and read the columns again: dates, amounts, names you’ve heard men whisper about.\n\nA knock comes—two quick taps, one slow—then the door opens without waiting. It’s **Lena**, the cigarette girl, cheeks flushed from running. She doesn’t look at your face; she looks at your hands. “Halden,” she says, and pushes a matchbook onto your table like it’s a tip. Inside, in tight pencil: **RAID. VICE BUREAU. TEN MINUTES. GET OUT. DON’T LET THEM TAKE YOU.** Under it, another line: **They asked about you by name.**\n\nBefore you can move, a man you’ve never seen steps into the doorway behind Lena as if he belongs there. Clean coat, no club stamp on his wrist, and a pale key-pin on his lapel—the same marrow-white symbol that marks your page. He sets a small case on the chair and says, calm as a banker, “New papers. New name. One delivery to a chalk-marked basement on Harker Street. Tonight.”\n\nThe hallway fills with footsteps and the distant bark of a whistle.

Neon from the sign bleeds through the front curtains, and the air behind the stage smells of powder, sweat, and spilled gin. Outside, a siren starts and dies.\n\nYou sit at your dressing table with one shoe off, garter loosened, working the stocking down your calf as if you’re only fixing a snag. The mirror bulbs buzz. Your stage lipstick is still perfect, but your hands are steady in the way they were in the tenement—steady because shaking never bought you mercy. The torn **ledger page** stays flat against your skin until you slide it into your palm and read the columns again: dates, amounts, names you’ve heard men whisper about.\n\nA knock comes—two quick taps, one slow—then the door opens without waiting. It’s **Lena**, the cigarette girl, cheeks flushed from running. She doesn’t look at your face; she looks at your hands. “Halden,” she says, and pushes a matchbook onto your table like it’s a tip. Inside, in tight pencil: **RAID. VICE BUREAU. TEN MINUTES. GET OUT. DON’T LET THEM TAKE YOU.** Under it, another line: **They asked about you by name.**\n\nBefore you can move, a man you’ve never seen steps into the doorway behind Lena as if he belongs there. Clean coat, no club stamp on his wrist, and a pale key-pin on his lapel—the same marrow-white symbol that marks your page. He sets a small case on the chair and says, calm as a banker, “New papers. New name. One delivery to a chalk-marked basement on Harker Street. Tonight.”\n\nThe hallway fills with footsteps and the distant bark of a whistle. You have the page, the warning, and the case in the same room, and every option has a price."

You get your shoe on just as the hallway noise sharpens—boots, a man’s laugh that doesn’t belong to the Lark, and the metallic jingle of a nightstick against a belt buckle.\n\nThe man with the pale key doesn’t flinch. He closes the dressing-room door with two fingers, not latching it—just enough to muffle the hall. Then he takes a step in, keeping his hands where you can see them.\n\n“Miracles don’t come cheap,” he says. His voice is educated, careful about it. “I’m not Vice. I’m not Saints. I’m sent by Mr. Ketteridge’s office.” The name lands like a calling card—Marrow Society money, the kind that buys judges and riverfront blocks.\n\nHe nods at the key-pin when you tilt your chin. “That pin is my receipt. It means if I’m found in pieces, someone important asks why.”\n\n“What’s in the case?” you press.\n\nHe doesn’t open it. He taps the lid once. “Documents. A birth certificate that doesn’t exist yet, a work card that already has stamps, and a letter of employment with a real company that will swear you’ve been on payroll for six months. Enough to walk through a station house without anyone deciding you’re worth holding.” His eyes flick briefly to your bare thigh before he looks away, like he’s marking where you keep things. “And something else. Sealed. Not for me.”\n\nLena shifts near the mirror, wringing her hands. “Eve—” she starts, but a hard rap hits the outer door to the backstage corridor, not yours—someone checking rooms.\n\nA male voice barks down the hall: “Vice Bureau—everybody out front! Dressing rooms next!”\n\nThe Marrow man lowers his voice. “Harker Street. Basement door with fresh chalk marks—surveyors’ marks. You take the case there. You hand it through. You don’t look inside the sealed packet if you value your eyes.”\n\nAnother set of footsteps—closer now—stops right outside your dressing-room door. A shadow cuts under it.\n\nThe knob turns once, testing."

She nods hard at “powder room,” but she doesn’t move yet—frozen by the sound of the knob testing again.\n\nYou take the case back. The Marrow man watches your hands like he’s counting seconds.\n\nYou snap the mirror bulbs off. The room drops into a dim gray, lit only by spill from the hallway. The stage-side panel—an old service hatch in the far wall—gives with a soft crack of dry wood as you ease it open. Cold air and the faint throb of sax and crowd noise seep through.\n\nIn the hallway, a fist hits your door—once, impatient.\n\n“Open up,” a man says, close enough that you can hear his breath. “Vice Bureau.”\n\nYou hiss at the Marrow man about Halden. He answers without heat, low and quick: “Halden isn’t running this. If he shows his face tonight, it’s to look useful—or to keep a certain file from walking. He’s in danger either way.”\n\nHe moves when you order him—quiet, but not graceful. His shoe scuffs the floorboard, a small sound that nonetheless seems enormous in the dark.\n\nThe knob turns again, harder this time.\n\n“Last chance,” the voice says.\n\nYou slip through the panel first, shoulder scraping the frame. The space beyond is a narrow service run behind the stage flats—painted canvas, ropes, and dust. You can see through a slit between curtains: the club floor is still full, but the mood has shifted—heads turning toward the front, people standing too fast.\n\nBehind you, the Marrow man squeezes for the hatch—\n\n—and at that exact moment the dressing-room door latch snaps with a sharp crack. The door swings inward, flooding the room with hallway light.\n\nA Vice Bureau officer fills the doorway, hat brim low, baton in hand. He takes in the dead bulbs, the open hatch, and Lena by the mirror like she’s been caught mid-prayer.\n\n“There,” he says, and points straight at the panel. “They’re going out the back.”\n\nBoots start running.\n\nYou are in the service run with the case. The Marrow man is halfway through the hatch, stuck for a breath as he drags a shoulder free. Lena is still inside the dressing room with Vice staring her down.\n\n```json\n{\"locations_add\":[\"Velvet Lark — stage service run\"],\"npcs_add\":[\"Lena (cigarette girl)\",\"Marrow Society courier (key-pin man)\",\"Vice Bureau officer (raiding party)\"],\"inventory_add\":[\"Small Marrow Society case\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[]}\n```"

You scoop a fistful and fling.\n\nIt hits him square across the eyes and nose. He jerks back with a strangled curse, baton clattering against the doorframe as he claws at his face. “God—!” He staggers, blinking hard, tears cutting white tracks through the powder.\n\nLena uses the half-second like she was born for it—she ducks under his arm and bolts into the hall, skirts up, moving fast and silent.\n\nYou hook your fingers in the Marrow man’s coat and haul. He comes through the hatch with a grunt, shoulder scraping wood, and lands wrong on one knee in the service run. He’s up again immediately, teeth clenched, the key-pin catching a sliver of stage light.\n\nBehind you, the officer barks, half-blind: “BACKSTAGE! NOW! SHE’S HERE—EVE MARLOWE!”\n\nBoots answer—two, then three sets—pounding toward the dressing rooms.\n\nYou tear down the service run, keeping low behind the flats. Canvas brushes your cheek. A rope swings and taps your shoulder as you pass. The sax on stage keeps wailing, but the crowd noise changes—screams now, chairs scraping, a shouted “Police!”\n\nAhead: the back exit door at the end of the run—painted black, with a push bar—and a thin line of rain-lit alley seeping under it.\n\nThen a stagehand you don’t recognize steps out from between two flats like he was waiting there, palms up as if to calm you. Saints haircut. Saints eyes. He holds a short iron bar low at his thigh.\n\n“Evenin’, songbird,” he says. “Boss wants his paper back.”\n\nBehind you, the service run fills with the hard clap of running boots and a voice shouting, “STOP!”\n\nYou have the Saints man blocking the back exit ten feet ahead, Vice closing from behind, and the Marrow courier at your shoulder trying not to breathe too loud."

He grunts, air punched out, boots skidding on dusty boards. The iron bar comes up late, clipping your shoulder as you shoulder past on his bar side. Pain flashes hot down your arm, but nothing breaks; it’s a glancing hit meant to stop you, not kill you.\n\n“Eddie—move!” you snap.\n\nThe Marrow courier lunges for the door when you shove him. He fumbles the push bar with both hands like he’s never used a stage exit in his life. It gives, and the door bangs outward.\n\nRain and alley light spill in. You both tumble out into the wet—cobblestones slick, garbage stink, fog hugging the brick. The door starts to swing back on its spring.\n\nBehind you, the Saints man recovers fast, wheezing. “She’s got the Society box!” he barks, and he’s already reaching inside his coat.\n\nInside the club, boots hit the service run. A Vice voice shouts, “ALLEY! CUT ‘EM OFF!”\n\nIn the alley, a black sedan is idling half a block down with its lamps off—engine ticking soft. The passenger door is already cracked open, like someone expected you. A silhouette inside turns its head toward you.\n\nThe Marrow man—Eddie, apparently—grabs your elbow with a sharp, desperate grip. “Not that car,” he hisses, eyes fixed on it. “That’s not ours.”\n\nThe backstage door slams open behind you.

The lid pops a finger-width. Something inside flashes pale under the street spill: not papers—something smooth and bone-white.\n\nThe Vice officer’s attention snaps to it. “The box!” he barks, and his pistol dips for the fraction you needed.\n\n“HALDEN!” you shout, loud enough to rake the windows.\n\nA shape moves at the far end of the alley—someone behind a rain barrel flinches like they’ve been waiting for that name, but they don’t step out.\n\nYou bolt for the sedan, low and cutting side to side.\n\nThe Vice officer fires once. The shot cracks off the brick above you, showering grit; the ricochet whines past your ear. He fires again—this one punches into the sedan’s rear quarter with a metallic *thunk*, sparking.\n\nThe Saints enforcer in the doorway doesn’t swing the bar—he throws. The small dark thing in his hand arcs and clatters near the case: a compact baton-light or weighted sap, meant to draw eyes—then he lunges for the skittering case instead, greedy and fast.\n\nYou reach the sedan’s open door and catch it with your left hand.\n\nInside: not Halden. A man in a dark coat and driver’s cap, jaw tight, eyes sharp. Marrow Society key-pin on his lapel, but his hands are wrong—ink-stained, not soft.

Powder-smoke blooms in the tight space, sharp and sour. The man grunts, surprised more than hurt, and his free hand slams into your shoulder to pin you back against the seat.\n\nOutside, Vice sees the muzzle flash through the window and answers with instinct: two shots crack into the sedan’s body—one spiderwebs the rear side glass, spraying cubes across the seatback; the other pings off the door frame near your elbow. Tiny shards bite your cheek and forearm.\n\n“Ink-fingered bastard—drive,” you snarl, shoving his wrist higher, forcing the barrel away from you.\n\nHe doesn’t fight you like a club bruiser. He twists with practiced economy, turning his forearm so your grip loses leverage, then he headbutts forward—hard. Your vision bursts white at the edges as his forehead clips your brow. Not a knockout, but enough to loosen your hands.\n\n“Driver!” he snaps, voice flat. “MOVE.”\n\nUp front, the driver—another man, broad shoulders under a slicker—drops the sedan into gear. Tires spin on wet cobbles, then catch. The car surges.\n\nAs it lurches, the passenger rips his gun arm free and shoves the pistol muzzle down between the seats toward you again, close enough you can smell oil on the metal.\n\n“You’re in my car,” he says, teeth tight. “You do *exactly* what I say.”\n\nThe sedan fishtails past the skittered Marrow case. In the side mirror you catch it for an instant: the Saints enforcer scoops it up one-handed, ignoring the Vice officer’s shouted orders. Eddie is still plastered to the brick shadow, staring after you like you just jumped off a pier.\n\nVice fires again—one last shot that cracks the trunk lid as you pull away—then the alley folds into fog and speed.\n\nYou are in a moving sedan with two Marrow men: driver in front, armed passenger beside you with a pistol inches from your ribs. The Vice and Saints are behind, and Eddie is left in the alley."

Streetlamps smear into long yellow lines across the wet glass.\n\n“Lose the tail,” you say.\n\nThe passenger flicks two fingers toward the windshield. “Rook—river road.”\n\nRook doesn’t answer. He just drives like he’s angry at the city: another turn, tighter, then a sudden brake-and-go that snaps your shoulder against the seat. Through the rear window you catch headlights—one set—bouncing at the corner you just took. Not a police cruiser; too low, too quiet. The Vice boys are likely still back at the club, but someone is following.\n\nThe passenger’s mouth tightens when he sees it. “Saints,” he says, like he’s tasting something rotten. “They got the case. That means they’ll want the *page* next.”\n\nHe leans in, voice low. “You shouting Halden in the alley wasn’t prayer. It was a flare. Someone heard it.”\n\nAs if to underline it, a car horn blats ahead—short, coded. Rook answers with a single flash of the headlights, then cuts the lamps entirely. The sedan plunges into a darker stretch where the fog sits thicker and the buildings lean closer.\n\nThe passenger finally lowers the pistol to his thigh, but keeps it in hand. “Name’s Sable,” he says. “And you’re right about one thing: you’re not dying over a box.”\n\nHe looks you over—blood, glass, the set of your jaw. “You’re dying if the Saints realize you don’t have it and start asking what you *do* have.”\n\nThe follower’s headlights vanish for a moment in the fog—then reappear closer than they should be, gaining.\n\nRook takes the next turn too fast, aiming the sedan toward the river road’s slick, open stretch—nowhere to hide if the tail sticks.\n\nNo one in this car is pretending anymore: you’re in a Marrow sedan running dark, with a Saints car closing in behind you."

Service lanes. Fish sheds,” Sable snaps, and for the first time there’s heat in his voice. “Chain gap.”\n\nRook’s head tilts a fraction, like he’s checking a map only he can see. Then the sedan veers left, not toward the open river road but into the dock grid—narrower streets, stacked crates, black puddles, and the stink of brine and diesel. He kills the headlights without slowing. The world outside becomes silhouettes: gantry cranes like praying mantises, warehouse doors like shut mouths.\n\nBehind you, the Saints’ car doesn’t follow the turn clean.

Up ahead, the chain gap you remember is there… but it isn’t empty.\n\nTwo dock sentries stand by the break in the chain, cigarettes glowing. One lifts a hand, palm out, as the sedan rolls toward them dark. The other’s coat bulges at the hip—gun.\n\nRook brakes hard. The sedan noses down.

Dates. Payments. It buys us the tunnel permits without a fight—or it buys us their silence.”\n\nThe sentry’s hand drops to his hip.\n\n“Window,” Sable says to you, low and urgent. “Tell them you belong here, or this turns loud.”"

You hear an engine idle, then the crunch of tires on gravel as their car creeps forward. A door opens. A man’s voice carries, low and amused: “Found you.”\n\nThe armed sentry makes a quick, ugly choice: he yanks the chain up and hooks it higher—opening the gap wider—but he doesn’t wave you through. He points, instead, at the narrow cut between two sheds on your right.\n\n“Not through the main,” he says. “Cut between the fish sheds. There’s a back spur to Pier Nine. Go *now*.”\n\nThen he steps into the lane and lifts his free hand toward the Saints’ lights like he’s about to play traffic cop, buying you seconds.

The glass spiders and blows outward in a spray. His shot isn’t aimed to kill; it’s aimed to make them duck. One of the Saints drops behind a piling, the shotgun man flinching aside as pellets don’t come—just the threat.\n\nBut the Saints recover fast. A second later the shotgun barks anyway, not at you directly but into the shed wall—wood explodes into splinters that whip past the car like angry insects. A chunk of plank smashes the rear quarter panel with a dull thud.\n\nRook threads the sedan onto a back spur—narrow rails half-buried in mud—leading toward Pier Nine. Ahead, the fog thins just enough to show a squat warehouse with fresh chalk marks on its basement doorframe: surveyors’ lines, and beneath them a small, marrow-white key symbol.\n\nThe immediate threat: the Saints are in pursuit on foot with firearms and have line-of-fire down the shed cut; your rear window is gone and the car has taken a hit, but you’ve bought distance and reached the spur toward the marked basement door."

The frame shudders. A seam opens for an instant—thin as a knife blade—then snaps back.\n\nOn the other side, the man grunts and braces harder. “Stop—!” he barks, and you hear a bolt slide into place—metal on metal—adding a deeper resistance. He’s not helping you; he’s reinforcing it.\n\nAt the window, a hand appears—pale knuckles, ring on one finger—curling over the broken sill.\n\nSable doesn’t hesitate. He fires once.\n\nThe shot punches through the hand with a wet crack. Blood spatters the outside brick and the fingers vanish, followed by a scream that turns into panicked shouting: “Jesus—my hand!”\n\nBut your battering has already bought you something you didn’t want: the Saints now know exactly where you’re trying to go. Boots pound closer and the fog fills with bodies. Someone outside yells, “They’re on the tunnel door—get an iron on it!”\n\nA second Saints man lunges up toward the window anyway, more desperate than smart.

Last warning: back off, or I’ll put a round through the wood.”\n\nImmediate threats, plain: Saints are actively attempting to force the window and are calling for heavier muscle; Sable has wounded one climber but is about to be targeted; the man behind the door has reinforced it and is threatening to shoot through if you keep ramming."

The lantern-light under the door steadies.\n\n“Eve Marlowe,” the man repeats, tasting it like he’s deciding whether it’s worth remembering. “Velvet *Aster*?” There’s a dry edge to it, like he caught the lie or the mistake.\n\nA small sliding panel you hadn’t noticed—set chest-high in the door—snicks open. A narrow rectangle of light falls across the damp floorboards. An eye appears in it, sharp and unblinking.\n\n“Show me your hands,” he says. “Both. And the case—if you’ve got one.”\n\nAt the window, Sable stays low, but the Saints don’t. A head and shoulders rise into view, bolder now, one arm hooked over the sill. He’s got a short-barreled pistol clutched awkwardly in his good hand, shaking with pain and rage.\n\nSable fires as instructed—one round into the climber’s shoulder. The man’s body jerks; his pistol discharges wild into the ceiling beams with a splintering crack, and then he drops out of sight with a howl.

His picks whisper and click—quiet, patient work.

He’s measuring.\n\n“I haven’t heard you,” he says. “But I’ve read about you. Which is worse.”\n\nOutside, the Saints’ “long tool” arrives with a scrape and a grunt. The iron bar’s hooked end bites into the window frame. Wood groans. The broken sill shifts a fraction inward.\n\nSable, still pinned, fires blind once toward the bar. The shot rings off something metallic with a *clang*—a miss. Immediate return fire cracks back; a round punches through the interior edge of the window frame and chips plaster near Rook’s shoulder. Rook flinches but doesn’t move off the lock.\n\n“Catch is—” Rook whispers, then stops as the lock fights him. Sweat shines on his lip. “It’s spring-loaded.

A Saints man’s face appears in the opening—flat cap, wet hair plastered to his forehead, eyes bright with hate.

He didn’t trust your bargain; he trusted the name.\n\nYou drop your left hand and drive your shoulder into the jamb, fingers finding the cold edge of the mechanism. Rook’s eyes cut to your hand; he nods once and turns his pick with a careful twist while you hold pressure on the spring.\n\nThe lock gives. Not a little—fully. The door lurches inward an inch.\n\nA gunshot answers from the fog outside—aimed at movement. The round punches through the door’s upper panel with a fist-sized burst of splinters, just above where your head had been when you leaned in. The man behind the door yanks it wider and drags you across the threshold by your coat sleeve, hard enough to make your shoulder bark.\n\n“Inside. Now,” he snaps.\n\nRook ducks and slips through after you, keeping low. As he crosses, another shot cracks; the bullet chews the floorboard where his foot was a second before.\n\nAt the window, Sable grabs the wounded Saints man by the collar and belt and hauls. The body scrapes, then wedges into the opening with a wet thump—shoulders jammed against the frame, head lolling. It buys you seconds, not safety: the iron bar keeps prying from outside, levering against ribs and wood alike. You can hear Saints cursing as they try to drag their man back and keep the opening.\n\nSable dives down and rolls toward the door, taking a grazing hit—his sleeve tears and a line of blood opens along his upper arm. He grunts but keeps moving.\n\nThe man behind the door—up close now: neat mustache, gray suit under a raincoat, and a small white key pin at his lapel—slams the door shut and throws the bolt back in. The frame shudders as something heavy hits it from the outside.\n\nHe keeps one hand on the bolt and levels a compact pistol with the other at all three of you.\n\n“Crowley’s outside,” he says flatly. “That name just bought you entry.

Rook keeps his hands visible and quiet, breathing through his nose, watching the Marrow man’s trigger finger.\n\nThe key-pin man makes a quick decision. With his left hand still on the bolt, he reaches into his coat with his right—pistol never leaving you—then shifts the pistol to his left in one smooth motion and produces a small brass whistle in his right.

Fine.” He jerks his chin down the corridor. “You walk. Slow. Hands where I can see. Your friend with the cut goes in the middle.”\n\nThen, to you, quieter: “And you tell me who paid Crowley while we move. If I don’t like the answer, I don’t have to hand you back to them. I can put you in the river tunnel myself.”\n\nHe steps aside just enough to let you pass—still covering you—while the woman plants herself near the door, shotgun ready, listening to the Saints working the spike on the other side.

I’m not Saints.”\n\nThe lantern slit catches him as he edges a fraction into view: a pale cheekbone, a hand braced on wet brick, fingers splayed to keep balance. He’s down in the water, knee-deep like the key-pin man said, coat dark with soak. No Saints armband. No union pin. But he’s got a small revolver in his right hand, held low along his thigh like he doesn’t want to show it and can’t afford not to have it.\n\nThe shotgun woman shifts her stance exactly like you told her—muzzle covering the drop, finger outside the trigger guard. She doesn’t fire. She does say, flat: “Drop it in the water, Niall.”\n\nNiall’s jaw works. He doesn’t drop it. “If I drop it, I’m dead,” he whispers back. “If you shoot me, you’re dead too. They’re behind you.”\n\nThat’s when the sound behind you changes from distant pursuit to near certainty: bootfalls, multiple, slapping puddles and rail iron. A cough, then a barked order that bounces down the tunnel: “Light! I saw light—move!”\n\nThe key-pin man doesn’t wait for more permission. He slips past you through the pinch, keys clenched, and you hear him splash down into the sluice. He lands awkwardly with a wet grunt, then starts wading left, feeling along the wall with his free hand. Metal scrapes—his keys searching for a keyway you can’t see from above.\n\nRook keeps Sable pinned up at the lip with you like you ordered, one hand hooked under Sable’s collar to keep his head from lolling forward. Sable sways, eyes unfocused, breathing loud in the tight brick.\n\nNiall stays in the water, half-turned between you and the direction the key-pin man went, as if he’s guarding that path—or trapped by it.\n\nImmediate threats are now split and concrete:\n- The Saints are within seconds of the pinch; their voices are close enough you can hear individual breaths between coughs.\n- At the drop, you’ve got an armed man (Niall) in the sluice who refuses to disarm, and your key-pin man is exposed in the water trying to find and open a second gate you haven’t confirmed yet."

Your boots hit knee-deep cold and the shock bites straight through leather.

You hear him curse under his breath, then the scrape of metal on metal—key against a hidden plate. “Got it,” he whispers urgently. “Door’s here—chalk mark was true—”\n\nA sudden rattle answers him: not a lock turning yet, but a chain on the far side being yanked taut, like someone’s holding the door shut from within.\n\nThe key-pin man freezes with the key half-seated. “Someone’s on the other side,” he says, voice tight. “Holding it.”\n\nBehind you, at the pinch, Saints boots hit the brick choke point—close.

He wedges Sable’s limp body against a protruding mortar seam and keeps Sable’s chin tilted up with one hand. “He’s breathing—barely,” Rook spits, fighting panic.\n\nThe shotgun woman retreats from the pinch, boots splashing through firelight. She tears her own coat off, drops to a knee, and starts beating at the flame’s leading edge. “Keep it off the wall!” she yells, stamping. The fire hisses but keeps crawling around her efforts in thin tongues.\n\nYou slam the door seam. The voice on the other side comes back, strained and close, like they’re pressing their cheek to wood. “You don’t understand—if I unhook it, they’ll—” A sharp intake of breath. “My hand—Jesus—”\n\nThe key-pin man grinds the key again when you crowd him.

The bench scrapes loud as a confession. “This’ll have to do!” he hacks out.\n\nImmediate threat: the door is still pinned by the cart rim, but the jamb is breaking down under crowbar work and gunfire; the gap is widening, and the Saints are seconds from forcing it enough to push a weapon—or a man—through."

Tommy’s breathing comes out in wet little bursts, but he clamps his mouth shut.\n\nYou put your ear to the personnel door.\n\nOn the other side: nothing—no footsteps, no voices—just the faint creak of a building settling and the distant hiss of rain. For half a breath it feels empty.\n\nYou try the handle.\n\nIt doesn’t budge. Not just locked—latched hard, like there’s a bar or a deadbolt thrown from inside. You rattle it once, carefully, and the metal gives a dull clunk that seems too loud in the bay.\n\nYou pat the frame. Your fingers find cold rivets, peeling paint, and—near the top corner—wire mesh over a narrow glass pane. The glass behind the mesh is intact. No easy reach-through. Along the hinge side you find a seam where the frame’s slightly proud, but there’s no exterior latch—just solid industrial fit.\n\nThe headlights sweep again, closer now, painting the wet ground in front of the bay. The light doesn’t hit you directly in the recess, but it catches the edge of Rosa’s hair and turns the rain into white needles. The engine idles just beyond the fog, a patient purr.\n\nFrom behind, around the warehouse corner you came from, a man’s silhouette breaks into view—Saint on foot, revolver low, moving fast along the wall like he knows exactly where the recess is. He hasn’t seen you yet, but he’s close enough that if he rounds the last few yards, he’ll be looking straight into the bay’s mouth.\n\nNiall whispers, tight and urgent, “Eve—door’s no good.”\n\nRosa lifts her good hand and points, not to the door—up. Inside the recess, above the personnel door, there’s a rain gutter and a metal ladder bolted to the brick that runs to a narrow catwalk line under the eaves. “Roofline,” she mouths.\n\nThe threats are immediate and specific: one Saint is about to round into the loading bay from behind with a revolver, and the car’s headlights are sweeping and idling somewhere ahead, ready to catch anyone who bolts out of cover."

He’s got a revolver in his right hand, finger already inside the guard. His eyes flick into the recess—and catch the ladder movement above your head.\n\n“Got you—” he starts, bringing the gun up.\n\nYou slam your shoulder into him before he can aim. The revolver cracks anyway—one shot—deafening in the recess.

The door bows inward a fraction with each hit, vibrating through the frame into your hands and forearms. He shouts, voice close and furious, “OPEN IT! OPEN IT OR I SWEAR—”\n\nThen another sound joins him: boots arriving on the roof access outside, someone else barking, “He’s in the door—get it!”\n\nThey start working the bulkhead from the roof side—shoulders, hands, maybe a boot—trying to force it. The wedge buys you seconds, not minutes.\n\nNiall grabs your elbow and yanks you down the stairs. “Move,” he says, breath tight. “They’ll tear that door off.”\n\nAs you descend, the stairwell opens into a dim utility corridor below—light leaking from a bare bulb somewhere ahead. The pounding above continues, but muffled now. You can still hear the metal door flexing.\n\nAt the bottom landing, Rosa is bent over, trying to breathe quietly. She looks up at you, eyes shining with fear. “Which way?” she whispers.\n\nBehind you, from above, the wedge gives a sharp, warning *squeal*—metal slipping a hair.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"Saint’s club\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Warehouse stairwell — interior stairs\",\"Warehouse interior — lower landing/utility corridor\"],\"npcs_add\":[]}"

Dust sifts down the stairwell.\n\nYou start forward toward the faint light. The corridor is concrete and narrow, with sweating pipes along the ceiling and a single bare bulb in a wire cage throwing a sick yellow pool ahead. Your shoes scuff grit and something that smells like old brine and machine oil.\n\nIn that light you catch shapes:\n\n- On the right: a small office door, painted gray, with a frosted glass panel. Black stenciled letters read **FOREMAN**. The door is shut.\n- Straight ahead: a wider opening into a utility run where the bulb hangs; beyond it, you can hear a slow **drip…drip** and the faint hum of electrical gear.\n- On the left: a heavy steel door with a wheel-handle like a ship hatch—chalked with the same surveyor marks you saw upstairs, and that marrow-white key symbol faintly sketched beside it. It’s shut.\n\nRosa limps after you, trying to keep her steps quiet, one hand pressed to her thigh.

NOW!”\n\nNiall snaps, loud and sharp: “GO!” Then the first boot thuds onto the top steps.\n\nThe threat is immediate and closing: at least two Saints have breached the roof door and are starting down the stairwell toward your corridor.  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Warehouse interior — foreman’s office door\",\"Warehouse interior — steel hatch door (key-marked)\"],\"npcs_add\":[]}"

It’s not a full flood, but it’s a hot, needling spray that turns the air into a scalding fog near the entrance. The Saints’ shots keep snapping and chipping at the brick lip—farther back now, mostly noise and ricochets, but close enough that you hear fragments patter down the crawlspace.\n\nYou catch Niall’s wrist and tug him in tight. He answers between clenched teeth, voice low. “Burn. Not blood.” He flexes his hand once like he’s checking he can still use it. “Two rounds left.”\n\nOutside, a Saint barks, “He shot my hand—!” and another voice, colder: “Then don’t reach in again. Get the pry bar. We’ll open the wall.”\n\nMetal scrapes—someone drags something heavy, then a *clang* against brick. They’re not crawling in yet; they’re preparing to **widen the hatch** so they can pour fire and bodies into it.\n\nYou push forward, feeling ahead with your fingertips. The crawlspace runs another few yards, then your hand finds a change: a vertical seam in the brickwork with a corroded iron frame—an old maintenance grate set into the wall, flush and painted over a dozen times. It’s held by two slotted screws and a latch that’s been half-fused by rust.\n\nYou hiss, “Exit—here,” and start working it.\n\nYour nails scrape paint off. The latch doesn’t give at first. You jam two fingers into the crack and wrench—skin tears, and you feel warm blood smear on iron. On the second heave, the rusted latch *pops* with a small, ugly sound.\n\nThe grate swings outward an inch… then catches on something beyond it.\n\nThrough the gap you see why: there’s a chain looped across the other side, padlocked—someone secured this access from the outside. Past the chain is a dim basement room with stacked crates and a single bare bulb swaying slightly, like it heard the gunshots through the walls.\n\nImmediate threat: you’ve found an exit, but it’s **locked from the far side**; behind you the Saints are bringing tools to break the hatch wider, and the hot mist is getting worse the longer you stay in the crawlspace."

The iron frame groans, flakes of rust raining down. The gap widens another inch—enough to see the chain’s path clearly—but the anchor doesn’t pop.

The tool noise stops for a beat.\n\n“There!” one of them snaps. “They’re close—keep opening it!”\n\nA pry bar bites into the hatch behind you with a brutal *crack* of wood. Light spills farther into the crawlspace, and with it comes a fresh burst of gunfire—three shots, fast. One round punches into the crawlspace wall a few feet behind Niall, spitting brick chips that sting your calf.\n\nNiall crawls up tight behind you, jaw set, trying not to breathe the hot mist drifting forward. “I can do it,” he says, but his burned sleeve is stuck slightly to his forearm where the spray hit; he peels it free with a hiss.\n\nYou can’t lever the anchor loose with your hands; the chain is too well set. The only clean options are force (shooting the padlock) or finding a way to reach the lock from the other side.\n\nNiall angles his pistol toward the gap, trying to line up the padlock through the crack without putting his face in the opening. It’s a bad angle—iron grate, chain links, and a swaying bulb beyond.\n\nDanger is immediate and concrete: the Saints are widening the rear hatch and raking the entrance; if Niall fires and misses, the ricochet in this tight space could hit you or Rosa, and the shot will also draw the Saints into a full, committed push into the crawlspace now that they know you’ve found an exit point."

He keeps the pistol angled down the stairwell like you told him, but his wrist tremors with the effort.\n\nYou scoop a jagged chunk of concrete from the stairwell edge and whip it back around the corner. It clatters and skitters loudly down the corridor floor, striking the wall with a sharp *KRAK* like something heavier than it is.\n\nThe Saints react exactly the way you want for half a second.\n\n“Jesus—!” one of them yelps, and their boots stutter. Another barks, “It’s not— it’s a rock, you idiot—!”\n\nThat half-second buys you two steps.\n\nThen the heavier Saint commits. Boots hammer the corner and a broad shape leans into the bend, pistol outstretched. He fires up the stairwell on instinct.\n\nThe round slams into the metal rail beside your hand with a vicious *SMACK*, tearing a bright chip of steel and vibrating the whole railing. Your fingers go numb from the shock, but you’re not hit.\n\nNiall answers with one shot downward. The muzzle flash lights his face. The Saint at the corner jerks back with a grunt—hit or grazed, you can’t tell—then disappears from view, replaced by another man’s shoulder as they crowd for the angle.\n\nAbove, the door at the top of the stairs opens a crack. Light spills down in a thin wedge. A face appears in it—pale, sweating, hair slicked back—Tommy Coyle’s, eyes wide and feral.\n\nHe’s not holding a gun. He’s holding the door with both hands like it weighs a ton.\n\n“Eve,” he says, voice breaking. “Hurry. They’ll—” A shout from somewhere above him cuts him off, and Tommy flinches like someone just yanked a chain attached to his ribs.\n\nThreat is immediate and specific: Saints are at the stairwell corner firing up; at least one is willing to shoot blindly. The top door is open only a crack and Tommy is being pressured by someone above to close it."

He blurts upward, fast and desperate: “She’ll talk to the cops—she knows names—” His voice cracks on the last word.\n\nThe unseen person above answers with a low, cold laugh. “So do we.”\n\nDown below, you bark at the Saints about their stack.

The bottle arcs up toward the stairwell, rag stuffed in its mouth burning bright.\n\nIt hits two steps below you and bursts.\n\nFlame blooms across the metal treads with a wet *WHOOMPH*, licking up fast—cheap spirits and oil. Heat punches your shins. Smoke curls up the stairwell, harsh and sweet, and the fire starts climbing the steps toward you, fed by the spill running downhill.\n\nYou haul Niall up another step; he nearly goes down on his knee, catches himself, and keeps climbing, teeth bared. Rosa doesn’t stop—she scrambles higher, coughing as the first smoke reaches her.\n\nAbove, Tommy yanks the door wider—now open enough for one person to squeeze through at a time—but he’s losing leverage. Something tugs him from behind, and his shoulders jerk back as if someone’s grabbed his belt.\n\nThreats now: fire is spreading up from below, cutting off retreat and forcing you upward fast; Saints are closing the bend behind the flames; and someone above is physically pulling Tommy away from the door, risking it slamming shut again before you reach it."

The pistol slips free of his fingers and skitters across the tar in a short, scraping arc, stopping near the base of a vent.\n\nYou shove him backward toward Eddie’s sightline. He stumbles, clutching his ruined wrist to his chest, eyes blown wide with pain.\n\n“Fetch,” you snarl—and you go.\n\nYou drop low and bolt for the water-tank hatch, boots slipping once on rain-slick gravel before you catch yourself on a hand and keep moving.\n\nEddie’s rifle snaps a hair to follow you, but his own man lurching into the lane fouls the shot. Eddie barks, “Get down!” and doesn’t fire—yet.\n\nCrowe moves immediately. Not chasing straight—cutting angle. She sprints in a shallow arc to beat you to the hatch line, coat tails snapping, that pale length of wire/chain swinging ready at her side.\n\nBehind you, the injured man half-falls, half-crawls toward his gun with his good hand, teeth bared. Eddie shifts his weight like he’s about to step in and cover him.\n\nRosa and Tommy, hearing you, break from cover and scramble the direction you shouted—low, fast, panicked. Tommy’s limp makes him slower; Rosa grabs his sleeve and yanks him along.\n\nYou reach the hatch: a squat metal door set into the roof near the tank’s iron legs. There’s a chain on it—looped through the handle—and a cheap padlock, already rust-bitten.\n\nCrowe is closing from your right, maybe ten yards and shrinking. Eddie’s rifle is recovering its lane as his man clears it.\n\nThe immediate threat is simple and brutal:\n- The hatch is chained and locked; you can’t just drop through.\n- Crowe will be on you in seconds.\n- Eddie now has a clearer shot as you’re pinned at the hatch."

The thick, riveted supports cut Eddie’s line clean; his rifle barrel tracks, but there’s no shot without stepping wide.\n\nYou wrench at the roof edge and get a fist-sized chunk of tarred brick and gravel. It’s ugly and heavy. You bring it down on the padlock.\n\nFirst strike: a metallic *clang* that rings through the rain.\nSecond: the lock jumps, but holds.\nThird: the chain bites into the hatch handle and sprays rust dust.\n\nRosa and Tommy scramble toward you. Tommy’s breathing is a ragged saw; Rosa is half-dragging him, shoes slipping. They’re still a few strides out.\n\nCrowe closes to within a few yards, then slows—smart. She doesn’t rush into your swing. The pale thing in her hand is clearer now: a short length of fine chain with a weighted end, like a sap made for bones and breath. She keeps it low, ready to snap up.\n\n“You talk pretty when you’re cornered,” she says, voice steady. “Doesn’t change the math.”\n\nYou spit the line about her leash without looking up and keep hammering.\n\nThe padlock finally gives—not cleanly. On the next blow, the shackle twists and cracks, and the lock body splits. The chain slumps loose across the hatch.\n\nAt the exact moment the lock breaks, Eddie steps wide left to re-find an angle around the tank legs. He gets a slice of you—shoulder and head—between iron uprights. He doesn’t take a careful shot. He fires once, quick.\n\nThe bullet whines off iron with a vicious *ping* and throws a hot fleck that stings your upper arm like a cigarette kiss. Not a through-and-through—more a grazing burn and torn fabric—but it jolts you.\n\nCrowe uses the gunshot as cover. She surges in the last steps.\n\nYou scoop a bootful of wet gravel and whip it up. It splatters across her cheek and into one eye. She hisses and turns her face away, blinking hard—but she’s already committed. The weighted chain snaps out anyway, low and fast, aiming for your wrist/hand on the hatch.\n\nRosa reaches the tank legs just as the chain whistles past her shoulder. She yelps and ducks. Tommy drops to his knees, scrambling for the hatch handle with shaking hands.\n\nThe hatch is now unchained and can be opened—but Crowe is in striking distance, Eddie has a partial angle again, and the Saints man with the busted wrist is still somewhere behind you on the roof, not out of this yet."
