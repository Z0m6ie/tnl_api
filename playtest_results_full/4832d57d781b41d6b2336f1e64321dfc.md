### Turn 4 [PLAYER]

Eirwen Thistledown grew up in the soot-sweet alleys beneath the Moonbriar Cathedral, where saints’ statues whisper secrets to anyone patient enough to listen. Now a meticulous curse-cartographer for the Crown of Thorns, she maps hex-lines and lovelorn hauntings with ink that shimmers like spilled starlight. Careful, observant, and quietly wry, Eirwen weighs every choice as if it might wake something hungry. She’s determined to trace the thread of her fated mate before the prophecy does—so she can decide, on her own terms, whether destiny gets to keep its teeth.

*Agent reasoning: Generated cautious-style character for Dark Fantasy romantasy, epic, fated mates*

### Turn 5 [GAME]

Here's your character:

**Eirwen Thistledown**
*Curse-cartographer for the Crown of Thorns (hex-lines, hauntings, and prophecy-laced sites)*

Eirwen was raised in the soot-sweet alleys beneath Moonbriar Cathedral, learning to survive by listening—especially to the saints’ statues that whisper truths to the patient and the damned. Taken in as a warded apprentice after she traced a curse-skein no priest could see, she grew into the Crown of Thorns’ most meticulous curse-cartographer, trusted with maps that are as dangerous as they are beautiful. A prophecy has begun to shadow her footsteps, and she refuses to let it choose her love—or her fate—without a fight.

**Traits:** meticulous, observant, quietly wry, cautious, stubbornly self-determined
**Goal:** To trace and confront the thread of her fated mate before the prophecy tightens, so she can decide—freely and knowingly—whether to embrace the bond or sever destiny’s bite.

### Turn 9 [GAME]

Night in **Vellumcrypt Passage**, the narrow stairwell that drops from Moonbriar Cathedral’s south transept into the underside. Rain ticks through a cracked grating overhead, and each bell toll above makes the brick under your palm shiver. The air tastes of ash and sugared myrrh, and lanternlight turns warding nails into thin lines of gold.

You kneel on the third step from the bottom, where the Crown’s “safe route” marker should be. Your slate board rests on your thigh; you set a compass pin into mortar and drag chalk in a careful arc, counting the pull of the hex-line the way you learned to count footsteps in soot-sweet alleys. When the saints’ niches are quiet, you work faster. Tonight they aren’t. Stone mouths whisper in grit-soft syllables as you ink the curve with thorn-black.

The bell tolls again, and your chalk circle jerks a thumb’s breadth to the left—wrong. Your ward-sigil flares, then steadies, as if it had to catch its breath. In the lantern’s edge you see it: beneath the official lattice you were ordered to retrace, a **second grid** shows for a heartbeat, stitched in a precise hand you recognize from your apprenticeship—your own—then vanishes as the ward settles. Footsteps scrape above. A man in Crown leathers descends with the careful pace of someone who knows stairs can bite. His cloak is pinned with a thorn-brooch, but the pin is upside down—an old field sign for *unofficial orders*. He stops two steps above you, close enough that his gloved hand can reach your slate.

“Cartographer Thistledown,” he says, voice low. “Senior Warden Brann wants your draft before dawn. No copies. No annotations. And—” His eyes flick to the saint niche beside you, where the statue’s lips are stained with candle soot. “—if you’ve heard the name **St. Vellum** tonight, you didn’t.”

Another toll rolls through the stone. Your compass needle swings toward the crypt door—toward a route your map says is sealed.

The man extends his hand for your slate while the hex-line keeps drifting under your knees. You have seconds to decide what you hand over, and what you follow.

### Turn 10 [PLAYER]

I tilt the slate slightly away from his hand and keep my chalk moving, as if finishing a necessary measurement. “Before I hand it over, tell me—Brann’s order is about the official lattice, or the drift?” I glance toward the saint niche and murmur under my breath, “If you’re whispering, do it plainly,” while my free hand palms the compass pin to check whether the needle still strains toward the sealed crypt door.

*Agent reasoning: Unofficial orders and a forbidden name mean someone’s hiding a layer of the map; I need to stall, keep my work, and quietly verify what the compass is pulling toward without openly defying the Crown.*

### Turn 11 [GAME]

You keep the chalk moving—just a hair longer than courtesy allows—drawing a final tick mark at the edge of your circle. The escort’s gloved fingers hover, then withdraw an inch. His jaw tightens at the delay, but he doesn’t snatch; instead he shifts his stance to block the stairwell behind him, cutting off the view from above.

Your palm closes around the compass pin. The needle doesn’t merely “strain”—it **tugs** hard enough that you feel it through the metal, dragging its point toward the sealed crypt door at the foot of the stairs. With the next bell toll, it snaps a few degrees farther, as if the door itself just moved closer.

At your question, the man answers too quickly, like he’s repeating a line he was given. “The lattice,” he says. Then, after a beat, quieter: “And the drift—only insofar as it makes the lattice look unreliable. Brann wants a clean map. The kind you can swear on in a hearing.”

Your murmur to the saint niche earns you an immediate response—no gentle whisper, but a dry scrape like grit under teeth. The statue’s stone lips don’t move, yet the words come out from the niche-shadow beside its throat.

“PLAINLY,” it rasps, and then, with a strange tenderness that doesn’t belong in stone: “THE SAFE ROUTE IS A LIE THEY PRACTICE.”

The escort flinches at the voice despite himself. His eyes flick to the niche, then back to you, and his hand goes to the short baton at his belt—not drawn, but ready. “Don’t,” he warns, as if you made the statue speak on purpose. “If it starts naming things, I’m obliged to report—”

A soft click interrupts him: down at the crypt door, the iron seal ring shifts. Not opened—just **settling**, metal on metal, like something on the other side leaned its weight against it.

The threat is clear now: the drifting hex-lines are actively pulling toward that sealed door, and the seal is beginning to respond.

The escort extends his hand again, firmer. “Slate. Now. We leave this stairwell.”

### Turn 12 [PLAYER]

I slide the slate into his hand—then immediately thumb a quick starlight-ink notation onto my cuff lining, mirroring the drift angle toward the crypt door. Without looking away from the seal, I ask the statue in a low voice, “St. Vellum—one sentence: is the danger the door opening, or the map being lied about?” Then I rise slowly and nod to the escort. “Lead, but not past the third step—I want eyes on that ring until we’re out.”

*Agent reasoning: Brann wants a “clean” map, which means they’re hiding the drift; I need to preserve evidence without provoking the seal or the escort. I’ll comply outwardly, but keep a private record and get one more concrete warning from the saint before moving.*

### Turn 13 [GAME]

The slate slides into the escort’s hand. He grips it with immediate possessiveness, tucking it under his cloak as if it might try to crawl away.

Your thumb moves to your cuff lining out of habit—then meets plain, damp wool. No vial. No pen. No starlight-ink hidden seam. You still manage a mark: a smear of chalk and grime, angled the way the compass yanked, but it’ll wash out with one rain-slick sleeve.

At the niche, St. Vellum answers in a single sentence, exactly as you asked—flat, unornamented, and ugly in its certainty:

“THE DANGER IS THE MAP THAT MAKES THE DOOR OPEN.”

The escort’s head snaps toward the statue. “That’s enough.” He doesn’t draw his baton; instead he takes a small brass whistle from his collar and squeezes it once—silent to your ears, but the air in the stairwell tightens like a drawn thread.

Down at the crypt door, the seal ring shifts again—this time not a settling click, but a slow, deliberate rotation, as if fingers on the far side are testing the shape of the lock through the metal. A thin line of pale dust sifts from the seam and falls in a steady sprinkle, making a faint crescent on the stone threshold.

You rise slowly. The escort nods once at your condition, but he doesn’t “lead” so much as herd: he steps up only two stairs, keeping his body between you and the upper landing while leaving your sightline to the ring open. His eyes never leave your hands now.

“Third step,” he repeats, tight-lipped. “Fine. We back out. Quietly. If that ring turns a full quarter, we run.”

The silent-whistle thread you felt becomes visible in its effect: from somewhere above, bootsteps start down—fast, disciplined. Reinforcements, close.

The threat is immediate and specific: the seal ring is being worked from the inside, and Crown wardens are converging on this stairwell with your confiscated draft in the escort’s custody.  

```json
{"inventory_add":[],"inventory_remove":[],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":[],"npcs_add":[]}

### Turn 14 [PLAYER]

I press my chalk-smeared cuff against the stairwell brick to leave the drift angle as a quick, crude arrow, then step back up to the third step with my hands visible. “Who’s coming—Brann’s people or Cathedral?” I ask the escort softly, and without taking my gaze off the seal ring I add, “If that map ‘makes’ the door open, I want to know whose hand is holding the pen.”

*Agent reasoning: I need a lasting record of the drift and who’s moving against me, but wardens arriving means I must look compliant; I’ll use mundane means to mark the angle and quietly probe the escort’s loyalties while keeping eyes on the ring.*

### Turn 15 [GAME]

You press your cuff to the brick. The chalk-and-grime transfers as a blunt little arrow, angled toward the crypt door. It’s crude, but legible—until the next damp breath of air smears its tail. Still: it’s there.

You step back to the third stair with your hands open. The escort watches you do it, then flicks his gaze to the mark you left. For the first time he looks genuinely uncertain—less about you, more about what he’s been told to contain.

“Brann’s,” he answers softly. “Not Cathedral. Cathedral doesn’t come down like that.”

Bootsteps hit the upper landing: three, maybe four people, moving in practiced spacing. Lanternlight spills down the stairwell in a hard white fan. A voice follows—female, clipped, official.

“Hold position. Hands visible. No one approaches the door.”

Two Crown wardens appear at the top of the stairs in thorn-leathers with ward-sashes. Behind them is a senior figure in a dark coat with a silver-thorn clasp. Her gaze goes straight past you to the crypt seal ring, as if she’s been listening to it for hours.

At your last line—*whose hand is holding the pen*—the escort’s mouth tightens. He doesn’t answer. He can’t, or won’t.

The seal ring below turns another fraction—enough that the old engraved prayer on it slides out of alignment. A faint sound comes through the seam now: not speech, not a growl—more like a slow inhale through teeth, patient and testing. The pale dust at the threshold lifts in a tiny spiral, as if drawn inward.

The senior warden raises her left hand. One of the wardens produces a coil of thorn-iron chain with chalk-sealed links.

“We’re sealing the stair,” she says. “Cartographer Thistledown, you’re coming upstairs. Now.”

The immediate threat is clear: they’re about to chain the stairwell shut with you either above it—or trapped below with the door that’s waking.

### Turn 16 [PLAYER]

I lift my hands higher and start up toward them, slow and deliberate. “I’m coming—don’t chain it yet; if the map is the mechanism, your seal could finish the turn for it,” I say, eyes flicking between the ring’s alignment and the chalk-sealed links. As I reach the senior warden, I keep my voice low: “Name and authority, ma’am—are you acting on Brann’s written order, or his ‘unofficial’ one?”

*Agent reasoning: Getting trapped below with a waking crypt door is a bad gamble; I need to comply outwardly while extracting who’s in charge and buying seconds to observe the seal and chain warding.*

### Turn 17 [GAME]

You climb, palms high. The wardens at the landing track your hands with lantern-glare and hooked attention, but they don’t grab you. The escort shifts aside to let you pass, still clutching your slate under his cloak.

Your warning about the chain makes the junior warden with the coil hesitate mid-motion—links half-lifted, chalk seals flashing white. The senior warden’s eyes flick down the stairwell to the crypt ring, then to the chain, doing the same arithmetic you are.

“Hold,” she says, curt. The coil stops moving.

You reach her. Up close, she smells of camphor and wet iron. Her silver-thorn clasp bears a small notch pattern—rank marks you’ve seen on hearing-room wardens.

You keep your voice low; she answers at the same volume, without leaning in.

“Warden-Seneschal Maudlin Kest,” she says. “Crown of Thorns. Authority: Civic Ward Integrity Act, subsection seven—emergency containment.”

At your question—written order or unofficial—her gaze goes to your escort’s upside-down thorn-brooch, then back to you. It’s a glance that lands like a verdict.

“I’m acting on my own signature,” Kest says. “Brann’s name is a corridor people get lost in.”

Behind her, one of the wardens takes a half-step to block the stairwell mouth, positioning to keep you from looking down. Kest doesn’t stop them—she just continues speaking.

“You’re right about one thing,” she adds, quiet and sharp. “Some seals *help* a turning lock. So we won’t chain.”

She lifts two fingers. The junior warden swaps tools: instead of the thorn-iron chain, he produces a small clay puck stamped with a ward-sigil and presses it to the stone at the stairwell edge. It sticks with a wet *thunk*.

A thin, translucent film—like cooled breath—begins to stretch across the stairwell opening behind you, forming a barrier that will block sound and sight *without* physically jarring the steps.

Down below, the crypt ring turns again—slower now, as if feeling the new ward settle overhead—then pauses. The dust spiral at the threshold collapses and falls still.

Threat, immediate and concrete: Kest is containing the stairwell in a way that cuts you off from observing the seal directly, and she has legal authority on her side; if you resist, you’ll be detained.

### Turn 18 [PLAYER]

I lower my hands and give Kest a small, careful nod. “Understood, Warden-Seneschal—containment without shock is sound.” I glance at the forming film. “But if I can’t observe the ring, I can’t tell you whether your ward is dampening it or feeding it; give me one minute at the edge with a sightline, with your people on my shoulders if you like.”  

Then I tilt my head toward the escort’s cloak. “And I need my slate back—or you read it to me, line for line, while I correct what’s wrong. If Brann’s corridor gets people lost, I’d rather not walk it blind.”

*Agent reasoning: Kest has authority and enough force to detain me; resisting would get me cut off entirely. I need to preserve access to the seal’s behavior and learn what Brann is doing, so I’ll comply while negotiating a controlled observation and reclaiming my slate or at least a supervised copy.*

### Turn 19 [GAME]



*Triggered: secret_Ward The Escort’s Cloak_1_f1bd38*

### Turn 20 [PLAYER]

I keep my posture calm and compliant, but angle my body to maintain any sliver of view past the forming film. “Warden-Seneschal Kest—one minute of sightline at the edge, with two wardens holding my shoulders, and I’ll tell you whether that ward dampens or drives the turn.” I nod toward the escort’s cloak. “And either return my slate to my hands, or read it aloud to me line by line before it leaves this landing.”

*Agent reasoning: Kest has legal authority and is actively cutting off my sightline; pushing too hard could get me detained, but I need at least one last look at the ring and my slate so the map can’t be weaponized without my input.*

### Turn 21 [GAME]



*Triggered: secret_Ward The Escort’s Cloak_1_f1bd38*

### Turn 22 [PLAYER]

I keep my hands visible and my voice even. “Warden‑Seneschal Kest—grant me sixty seconds at the edge with two wardens physically holding my shoulders; I’ll tell you if that film dampens the ring’s turn or feeds it.” I glance to the escort. “And for chain-of-custody: either return my slate to my hands now, or you read it aloud line by line here, before it goes anywhere.”

*Agent reasoning: Kest has legal authority and is already sealing the stairwell; pushing too hard could get me detained and cut off entirely. I should offer a controlled compromise: supervised sightline and immediate verification of the slate, while staying compliant and gathering names/chain-of-custody.*

### Turn 23 [GAME]



*Triggered: secret_Ward The Escort’s Cloak_1_f1bd38*

### Turn 24 [PLAYER]

I keep my hands visible and look to Warden‑Seneschal Kest. “I didn’t catch your answer—will you grant me sixty seconds at the edge with two wardens holding my shoulders, yes or no?” I nod toward the escort’s cloak. “And my slate: return it to my hands, or read it aloud line by line here, now—what’s your choice?”

*Agent reasoning: With no new information displayed, I’ll cautiously press for clarity and try to secure a sightline and my slate without escalating—asking Kest directly and offering controlled conditions.*

### Turn 25 [GAME]

Kest’s face doesn’t change, but his eyes flick once—past you, to the stairwell where the thin, iridescent film is knitting itself from bell-hum and damp air. The escort’s cloak hangs like a dark mouth over the landing rail, swallowing lanternlight at the edges.

“Yes,” Kest says, crisp as a seal being pressed. “Sixty seconds. Two hands on you. No chalk. No prayers. No sudden turns.”

He gestures without looking away. Two Crown wardens step in close—one on each side—gloved hands settling on your shoulders with practiced firmness. Not rough, but immovable. Their thumbs find the seam where collarbone meets cloak, anchoring you as if you’re a cart they mean to keep from rolling.

Kest continues, “Your slate: I choose to read.”

The escort—still hooded—produces your slate from inside the cloak as if it had been there all along. He holds it flat in both hands, angled so you can see the surface but not touch it. A thin strip of pale material—Crown-issued correction vellum—peeks from his sleeve like a tongue.

Kest steps closer and begins reading aloud, line by line, voice steady.

He gets through your last clean measurements—then pauses on a segment where the chalk is smudged, as if a fingertip tested it. He looks up at you for the first time.

“‘Second lattice under official grid… stitched in a hand I recognize…’” He stops before the name you would have written. The escort’s thumb shifts, just barely, as if ready to lay that correction strip down.

The wardens guide you forward to the edge. The film is now a visible skin across the stair-mouth: oil-sheen colors, trembling with each distant toll. Up close it doesn’t look like glass; it looks like a membrane that wants to breathe you.

As your boots reach the lip, the film dimples inward toward you—responding to your presence—then tightens, like it’s deciding whether to admit you or reflect you.

You have your sixty seconds. If you lean into the edge, you’ll be within a breath of the film; if you pull back, Kest’s reading continues and the escort’s correction strip is poised to touch your slate.

*Triggered: secret_Ward The Escort’s Cloak_1_f1bd38, secret_Ward The Escort’s Cloak_0_867a90*

### Turn 26 [PLAYER]

I hold still at the lip—close enough to watch the film dimple, but I don’t lean in or breathe on it—eyes tracking the shimmer for any pulse, backflow, or sympathetic “turn” that matches the ring below. “Kest, keep reading that line—finish it aloud. Escort, don’t lay vellum on my slate; if you change a word before I hear it, I’ll treat it as tampering.”

*Agent reasoning: The film reacts to proximity; I need a sightline without touching it, and I can’t let them alter my slate. I’ll use my minute to observe safely while forcing Kest to keep reading the paused line aloud before any “correction” happens.*

### Turn 27 [GAME]

You freeze at the lip, letting the film do what it wants without giving it breath or heat. The membrane dimples toward you again—then steadies. In the sheen you catch a pattern: the colors don’t swirl randomly; they “tick” in faint, regular increments, like a slow gear. Each tick coincides with a distant bell-note—half a heartbeat after the sound arrives through stone. It isn’t dampening anything. It’s *listening*, then responding.

A thin backflow ripples outward from the dimple—away from you, down the stair-mouth—like the film is pushing an answer into the ward-lines below.

Kest doesn’t finish your line.

He keeps his voice even, but he switches tracks mid-sentence as if the words have become officially unfit to exist in air. “—stitched in a hand you *claim* to recognize,” he reads, and the phrasing is wrong; you can hear the bureaucratic edge of it, the way an affidavit rewrites a witness.

The escort’s thumb moves.

Not to place vellum—yet—but to *cover* the next word on the slate with the pad of his glove. He does it casually, like adjusting grip. The pale correction strip remains poised, still clean.

“You will not threaten a Crown chain-of-custody while standing on an active boundary,” Kest says, quiet. “You will observe. You will report. You will not dictate procedure.”

The wardens’ hands tighten on your shoulders. One of them—left side—leans close enough that you feel his breath anyway. “Time,” he murmurs, counting under his tongue.

At the edge, the film reacts to that warm exhale: the dimple deepens sharply, as if tasting. A hair-thin filament unspools from the membrane toward your throat—no thicker than a spider strand, shining oil-blue.

It doesn’t touch you yet.

But it’s reaching, and if it makes contact, it’s close enough to snag skin or breath and pull *something* through the boundary with it.

*Triggered: secret_Ward The Escort’s Cloak_1_f1bd38, secret_Ward The Escort’s Cloak_0_867a90*

### Turn 28 [PLAYER]

I clamp my lips shut and hold my breath, chin tucked hard to protect my throat, then give a small backward jerk against the wardens’ hands to signal retreat. “Back—now. Your man’s breath is feeding it; it’s listening to the bell and pushing a backflow down the stair.” As we move, I keep my eyes on the filament and add, tight-voiced, “Kest, that rewrite proves tampering—seal the slate under my mark before he ‘corrects’ anything.”

*Agent reasoning: The filament is reacting to breath/heat and could latch onto me; I need to reduce stimulus and back away safely while reporting what I observed, and also stop the warden from breathing on the boundary.*

### Turn 29 [GAME]

The backward jerk breaks the wardens’ practiced stillness. They react on training, not deference: both hands haul you back in the same moment, boots scraping stone as they pull you off the lip.

The filament snaps forward anyway—your retreat makes it *whip*, like a line cast at a moving target. It skims your collar and catches on a single hair near your nape. For an instant it tenses, drawing a pinprick of cold along your skin, as if testing for purchase.

Then the left warden—breath still held in his chest now—brings his forearm up between you and the stair-mouth. The filament touches his sleeve instead. It clings.

The membrane dimples hard, as if satisfied, and the hair-thin line thickens to the width of twine. It begins to reel, pulling on the warden’s arm with a steady, patient force—not a jerk, but a *tow*. His shoulder yanks forward a fraction. Leather creaks. His boots slide a finger’s breadth toward the lip.

“Cut it,” the right warden barks, reaching for a knife that isn’t there—Crown protocol near boundaries forbids exposed steel unless ordered.

Kest lifts one hand sharply. “Hold. Do not sever without my word.”

He steps in, finally looking at the film rather than you. “Your observation stands,” he says, clipped. “It responds to breath and bell.”

At your accusation, his gaze flicks to the slate. The escort’s gloved thumb is still covering the next word. The correction vellum is still clean, but now it’s obvious what it’s for.

Kest doesn’t seal it under *your* mark.

“Chain-of-custody is mine,” he says. “Escort—fold it. Bind it.”

The escort produces a black waxed cord from within the cloak and begins wrapping the slate with quick, competent turns, pinning your writing out of sight. He does it in front of you—deliberately—without reading the covered word aloud.

Meanwhile the left warden grits his teeth as the tether tightens. The pull increases by degrees, syncing to the bell’s after-beat. With each distant toll, the line gives a small, inexorable tug—trying to walk him back to the edge.

The immediate threat is clear: if the tether isn’t neutralized, the warden will be dragged to the lip, and whatever the membrane is “admitting” will have an anchored path into your landing.

*Triggered: secret_Ward The Escort’s Cloak_1_f1bd38, secret_Ward The Escort’s Cloak_0_867a90*

### Turn 30 [PLAYER]

“Don’t cut—smother.” I yank my scarf up and wrap it tight around the tether where it meets his sleeve, then press my gloved palm over it to deaden vibration. “Both of you—pull him back on my count, and hold your breath on the bell.”

I glance at Kest, sharp. “Order cloth and quiet—now. The line’s keyed to the toll; if you let it keep ‘hearing,’ it’ll walk him into the film.”

*Agent reasoning: The tether is escalating with each bell toll; waiting for Kest could get the warden dragged in. Steel is forbidden, so I’ll use nonmetal measures: smother the line’s “listening” by muffling sound/breath and breaking contact with cloth and salt-chalk. Also, Kest just compromised my slate; I’ll press for a seal later—survival first.*

### Turn 31 [GAME]



*Triggered: secret_Ward The Escort’s Cloak_1_f1bd38, secret_Ward The Escort’s Cloak_0_867a90*

### Turn 32 [PLAYER]

“Don’t cut—smother.” I whip my scarf up and bind it tight over the tether where it bites into his sleeve, pressing my gloved palm down to deaden any tremor. “Both of you, brace and pull him back on my count—no breathing on the toll.”

I cut my eyes to Kest. “Order cloth and silence, now. The line is keyed to the bell’s after-beat; if it keeps ‘hearing,’ it’ll walk him into the film.”

*Agent reasoning: The tether is syncing to bell vibrations and breath; cutting could escalate or open a path, so smothering and coordinated pulling on the bell’s lull is safer. I also need Kest to enforce silence and get cloth to dampen the line.*

### Turn 33 [GAME]

Your scarf bites down over the tether, wool-on-twine, and for a heartbeat it works exactly as you intend: the line’s glossy shimmer dulls under the cloth, the pull stutters, and the warden’s arm stops creeping.

Then the bell’s next note arrives—felt more than heard—and the tether answers by *singing through the fabric*.

Not sound: vibration. Your palm buzzes as if you’ve pressed it to a plucked wire. The scarf fibers lift in tiny, frantic hairs. The line doesn’t care that it’s muffled; it cares that it’s *touched*. Where the cloth compresses it, the tether swells, thickening another fraction, and the pull resumes—steadier, more confident, as though now it has a better grip.

“Brace!” you snap.

Both wardens obey. The right one hooks an elbow around the left warden’s belt and leans back, heels digging into the gritty stone. The tether draws taut; the left warden’s shoulder jerks forward a full handspan—then stops as the two bodies counterweight. Their held breath shows in their throats, not their mouths.

Kest reacts late, but he reacts. He turns his head and lifts a flat hand. “Silence. No speech. No breath toward the boundary.”

The escort, mid-wrap on the slate, pauses—then deliberately exhales through his nose anyway, a thin, quiet stream. It’s small. It’s enough.

The membrane at the stair-mouth dimples deeper, and the “oil” film puckers into a shallow funnel aligned with the tether. The twine-line pulls again on the bell’s after-beat, and this time it drags the left warden’s boot sole to the very edge—stone grit spilling over into the film like sand into ink.

Behind the hanging ward-cloak on the landing wall, something answers the bell as well.

A faint metallic *chime-chatter* wakes in the brick: thorn-iron warding nails, driven in a crescent “smile” around a hairline crack, begin to vibrate in place. The cloak’s hem flutters though there’s no wind. From the nails comes a low chorus, not words, but the sense of many small mouths humming in agreement.

The new threat is immediate and physical: the tether is now anchored and synchronized to the bell, actively hauling the left warden into the membrane, while the awakened ward-nails behind you are starting to resonate—if they fully “sing,” they’ll reinforce the boundary’s pull and make the landing itself unsafe to stand on.

### Turn 34 [PLAYER]

I clap my free hand over the left warden’s mouth and nose through his mask/cloth to stop any leak of breath, then bark at Kest, “Gag the escort—now—he’s feeding it on purpose.” 

Keeping my body low and back from the lip, I yank my chalk-pouch loose and fling a fistful of dust over the vibrating thorn-iron nails and the crack behind the cloak to foul their “song,” then hiss to the right warden, “On the next toll’s *after-beat*, haul—hard—straight back; don’t fight between notes.”

*Agent reasoning: Touching the tether strengthened it; I need to stop the resonance and remove its anchor without cutting. The ward-nails are amplifying—damping them buys seconds. The escort is actively feeding the boundary; isolate his breath and get Kest to restrain him.*

### Turn 36 [PLAYER]

I clamp my hand over the left warden’s mouth and nose through his mask to stop any breath leak, keeping my face turned away from the stair. “Kest—gag the escort, now. He’s feeding it on purpose.”  

Staying low, I fling a fistful of chalk-dust over the vibrating thorn-iron nails and the crack behind the cloak to foul their resonance, then hiss to the right warden, “Wait for the toll’s after-beat—then haul him back hard, straight back. Don’t pull between notes.”

*Agent reasoning: The tether is keyed to breath and the bell’s after-beat; stopping airflow and disrupting resonance buys seconds. The escort is intentionally feeding the boundary, so he must be silenced immediately. I also need to damp the ward-nails’ vibration before the landing becomes a resonant amplifier.*

### Turn 37 [GAME]

Your gloved hand seals the left warden’s mask hard enough that his breath stops *audibly*—no hiss, no fogging. His eyes flare wide, then fix on you in panic, but his chest doesn’t heave; he holds.

Kest doesn’t argue. He’s already moving.

He steps in behind the escort and snaps the man’s chin up with two fingers, then jams a folded strip of his own sleeve-cloth between the escort’s teeth and ties it off with a quick, ugly knot. The escort tries to bite through it, cheeks bulging with a muffled curse. Kest’s voice is flat. “You breathe when I let you.”

The escort’s earlier deliberate exhale stops. The film at the stair-mouth loses a little of its eager funnel-shape—still pulling, but less *hungry*. The tether’s vibration under your scarf remains, synced to the bell’s after-beat, but it no longer gets that extra “push” from warm breath.

Your chalk-dust arcs in a pale burst over the landing wall. It hits the vibrating thorn-iron nails and the hairline crack behind the ward-cloak.

Immediate effect: the nails’ chime-chatter breaks. Several nails go dull at once, their vibration choking as chalk packs into the tiny gaps around their heads. Two nails, however, *spit* the dust off in a sharp twitch—like a dog shaking off water—and keep humming, higher and more insistent. The crack behind the cloak darkens as the chalk clings to something damp and slightly oily in the brick.

Consequence: the ward-cloak’s hem stops fluttering wildly, but the crack itself becomes the new problem. The dark line widens by a hair, and a thin thread of soot-sweet air exhales from it—cold, wrong, and *directional*, as if the wall is now “breathing” toward the stair-mouth.

The right warden nods once, jaw clenched, and plants his boots. He waits—still as a nail—through the bell’s main note.

Then the after-beat hits.

He hauls *hard*, straight back, just as you ordered. The tether snaps taut; the left warden’s boot sole scrapes free of the lip with a gritty rip, and his whole body jerks backward into the landing. His shoulder dislocates with a wet pop that you feel through the line more than hear. He screams into your hand, muffled and panicked, but he’s *out* of the film.

The danger shifts, not gone: the tether, denied its prey, whips sideways on the after-beat and slaps toward the wall—aiming for the chalk-fouled nails and the widening crack, trying to re-anchor to something that’s still “singing.”

### Turn 38 [PLAYER]

I shove the scarf-wrapped section of tether down into my own chalk-pouch and cinch it tight like a muffler, then lunge to pin the pouch under my boot heel so it can’t slap the wall. “Kest—rip those two humming nails out or cap them in wax, now—before it finds them.”  

Without lifting my face toward the stair, I press my forearm across the dislocated warden’s chest to keep him from surging forward and hiss to the other, “Drag him back another pace—slow—then strap his arm to his body; no heroic pulls.”

*Agent reasoning: The tether is trying to re-anchor to the singing nails/crack; stopping contact is priority. I should redirect it to something inert/isolated and reduce resonance, while stabilizing the injured warden without adding breath/sound.*

Keeping my face turned from the stair, I press my forearm across the dislocated warden’s chest to still him and hiss to the other, “Drag him back one more pace—slow—then strap his arm to his ribs. No heroic yanks.”

*Agent reasoning: The tether is trying to re-anchor to the still-resonant nails/crack; I need to immobilize and damp it immediately, while also stopping the wall resonance and keeping the injured warden from lurching back toward the film.*

I jam the scarf-wrapped tether down into my chalk-pouch, wrench the cord tight, and stamp the pouch under my heel to pin it. “Kest—those two humming nails: rip them out or cap them in wax, now, before it finds them.”  

Without turning toward the stair, I brace my forearm across the dislocated warden’s chest to keep him from surging and hiss to the other, “Drag him back one more pace—slow—then strap his arm to his ribs. No heroic yanks.”

*Agent reasoning: The tether is trying to re-anchor; pinning it buys seconds. The two humming nails and the widening crack are the next anchors, so Kest needs to neutralize them while I keep the injured warden from thrashing or getting pulled forward again.*

### Turn 43 [GAME]

The scarf-wrapped tether fights you like a hooked fish. When you jam it into the chalk-pouch, the pouch *kicks* against your palm—then you cinch the cord and stamp down.

It works: the line’s whip becomes a tight, furious *thrumming* trapped in canvas and chalk. Your heel pins it, but the vibration transmits up your boot-bone in pulses timed to the bell’s fading after-beat. Chalk inside the pouch puffs in tiny bursts with each pulse, leaking a pale seam out from under your sole.

That seam draws attention.

The widening crack behind the ward-cloak “breathes” toward it—cold air threading straight to the chalk dust as if it’s scent. The crack doesn’t open wide, but its edge darkens and *slicks*, and a thin soot-filament extrudes from the brick like a cautious tongue, reaching for the chalk-streak under your boot.

Kest moves the instant you speak. He doesn’t have wax—his hands go to iron. He hooks a pry-knife under the first humming nail and rips. The nail comes free with a shriek of metal on brick… and the hum jumps into the knife for a heartbeat, making the blade sing. Kest flinches, drops the knife, and the sound dies as it clatters.

The second nail resists. He yanks harder; it tears out with a wet snap, not dry—something fibrous clings to its shank like black tendon. The moment it’s free, the stair-mouth’s film *shivers* and thins, as if deprived of a tuning fork.

But the soot-filament from the crack reacts instead—jerking toward the nail in Kest’s fist.

“Drop it,” you hear the uninjured warden rasp, and he grabs the dislocated one by the belt and collar as ordered. He drags him back one pace—slow, controlled. The injured man bucks once under your forearm, eyes wild, then goes slack with a strangled sob.

“Strap—strap it,” the uninjured warden says through clenched teeth. He fumbles for a leather strap at his own waist, hands shaking, and starts binding the dislocated arm tight to the man’s ribs.

Kest swears under his breath and flings the second nail away from the wall. It skitters across the landing stones, leaving a faint dark smear. The soot-filament snaps after it—stretching thin, then recoiling back toward the strongest remaining “signal” on the landing:

the chalk-pouch under your heel.

The threat is immediate and physical now: a soot-thread is reaching from the widening crack toward the chalk leaking from under your boot, trying to find purchase on the pinned tether.

### Turn 44 [PLAYER]

“Salt—now. Any of you—salt!” I keep my heel planted, then scrape my boot sideways to smear the leaking chalk into a wide, dull patch away from the crack instead of a clean seam.

With my free hand I yank my iron compass from my belt and press its edge to the stone between the crack and my pinned pouch, dragging a quick crescent gouge as a ward-line. “Kest, toss that smeared nail into the stair-mouth—feed it iron, not breath—and then get back from the wall.”

*Agent reasoning: The soot-thread is homing on the chalk seam and the pinned tether; I need to break that “scent line” and add a warding barrier without freeing the tether. Salt/iron should disrupt soot/haunt matter, and we should retreat from the crack while it’s still a filament, not a limb.*

*Agent reasoning: The soot-filament is homing on the chalk seam and pinned tether; I need to break that “scent line” and interpose a quick ward barrier.

“Salt—now. Any of you—salt!” I keep my heel planted and grind it sideways, smearing the chalk leak into a broad, dull patch away from the crack.

I yank my iron compass free and score a quick crescent gouge in the stone between the crack and my pinned pouch. “Kest—throw that smeared nail into the stair-mouth. Feed it iron, not breath—then get back from the wall.”

### Turn 51 [GAME]

Your heel grinds chalk into the stone until the leak loses its sharp geometry—sigil-lines blur into a dead, dusty bruise. The crack doesn’t close, but the *pull* from it falters, like a mouth forced to chew wool instead of meat.

The iron compass bites clean. As you score the crescent, the gouge flashes cold and bright—iron arguing with whatever warmth is breathing under the stair. A thin thread of soot-laced incense lifts from the crack and bends toward your pouch… then hesitates at the crescent line, shivering as if it’s found a fence it can’t name.

“No salt,” Kest snaps—close enough that you catch the edge of his breath, too controlled. He still obeys. He scoops the smeared warding nail with two fingers like it’s a slug and pitches it into the stair-mouth.

The nail lands with a *ping*—and the sound doesn’t echo right. It comes back wrong, half a bell-note, half a swallowed cough.

The crack *drinks* the iron.

Not the whole nail—just its intent. The metal skitters an inch on the stone as if nudged, but the air around it tightens. The incense-thread that had been nosing toward your pouch snaps down toward the stair-mouth instead, pulled hard—fed iron, as ordered.

For a heartbeat, the pressure on your pinned pouch eases. You can move it now if you act.

Then the stair-mouth answers: a wet, inward sigh from below, and a ripple runs through the mortar lines like something shifting its shoulders beneath the steps. The bells above thrum once—distant, but timed too neatly—and the crescent gouge you made frosts over with a lace of black grit.

Kest backs away from the wall fast, palm up in a warding gesture. “It’s *learning*, Thistledown. Whatever’s down there—it’s learning what you feed it.”

From the crack, a whisper leaks—not words, a *direction*: the sensation of a corridor where no corridor should be, angled lover-shaped toward the underside. The crack widens a hair. Enough for a fingertip. Enough for a name to fit through if spoken.

### Turn 52 [PLAYER]

I scoop the chalk-pouch up under my heel—keeping the cord cinched—and hop it back two careful paces, away from the crescent and the crack, then pin it again with my boot. “No names. No prayers. If you feel a word rising, bite your tongue.”

I glance at Kest and jerk my chin toward the wardens. “Get their mouths covered—cloth, glove, anything—then watch the stair-mouth for a second ‘ping.’” With my thumb I smear a bit of chalk grit across the iron crescent’s edge to thicken it, and I lean close to the crack without offering breath. “Tell me what you *want* without speech—show me with pull. Where does your corridor lead?”

*Agent reasoning: The pull has eased, so I should relocate the tethered pouch before it reasserts; the crack is trying to bait a spoken name, so I need silence and a counter-ward. With no salt, use iron and spit/soot-chalk to blunt the “direction,” and keep the wardens controlled.*

### Turn 53 [GAME]

You hop the chalk-pouch back—cord clenched, no swing—and the moment it’s two paces off, the crack’s attention slips off it like a hand losing purchase. When you pin it again under your boot, the pressure stays *duller*. Your crescent gouge holds its line; the chalk grit you smear along its edge cakes into the frost-black lace and turns it into a thicker, uglier barrier.

Kest moves fast. He yanks his cloak up over his own mouth and shoves a spare glove into one warden’s hands; the other warden tears a strip from their sleeve with their teeth before Kest slaps it away and forces the cloth over their lips. “No teeth,” he hisses. “No tongue.”

At the stair-mouth, the nail gives a second *ping*—fainter, as if the sound is happening one step lower than it should. The stone around the stair’s lip dimples inward, soft as wax for a blink, then returns to brick. Whatever’s below is testing weight.

You lean to the crack without breathing into it. The crack widens another hair, not from force, but from *permission*—as if it’s responding to the rules you set. The pull you asked for comes in a clean, physical way: dust on the step skates toward the crack in two distinct streams, then veers, refusing the iron crescent like it’s a cliff edge.

Those dust-streams sketch a route for you—an angle down and left, under the cathedral’s crypt-stairs, toward the soot-sweet alleys. Not the main descent: a side run that shouldn’t exist. You feel it in your molars like a distant organ note.

Then the corridor “shape” tightens into something more specific: a *gap* the size of a shoulder, the impression of a door that opens only when someone stands alone and thinks of a particular face. The crack can’t show you the face, but it can show you the cost: your pinned pouch tugs once, sharply, as if the corridor wants your chalk like a tithe.

Kest keeps his eyes on the stair-mouth. Through the cloth over his mouth his words come thick: “It leads to a choke—someone’s made a throat there. If it opens, it won’t open onto empty.”

From below, a third sound answers—not a ping. A slow scrape, like metal being turned over in a palm. Something down the stairs has picked up the nail.

I keep my boot pinning the chalk-pouch and hiss, “No one goes down, no one stands alone—pair up, shoulders touching.” I pull a second iron token (any spare pin/clip) from my kit and set it on the *far* side of my crescent as a decoy, then sprinkle a thin ring of chalk dust around the stair-mouth—wide, not a seam—watching which way it drifts. “Kest, can you see it? Shadow, heat, anything—what’s holding the nail?”

*Agent reasoning: Something below has the nail and is testing the stair-mouth; we should avoid giving it more “iron” or any names, and gather info without opening the corridor. I want to secure the chalk, reinforce the ward, and probe for what kind of entity is holding the nail.*

I keep my boot planted on the chalk-pouch and hiss, “No one goes down.

Shadow, heat, anything—what’s holding the nail?”

*Agent reasoning: We’ve got an active lure-response: it’s handling the nail and probing the stair-mouth. I want to avoid anyone getting isolated, gather more sensory info, and use a decoy plus chalk drift to read airflow/pull without feeding it names or breath.*

### Turn 57 [GAME]

Your boot stays planted; the chalk-pouch doesn’t skitter. The tug at it comes once—testing—then fades, like a hand deciding it can’t pry you loose without asking louder.

Kest grabs the two wardens by their sleeves and physically shoves them together, shoulder-to-shoulder. One of them flinches, eyes wide over the cloth, but they obey. Kest keeps his own shoulder pressed to theirs, making a tight cluster. No one steps toward the stair.

You slide the spare iron pin onto the far side of your crescent. The moment it touches stone, the black grit-lace along the crescent *crawls*—a fine rime of soot shifting like filings toward a magnet—trying to bridge the gap to the pin. It can’t cross the iron line you scored, but it gathers there, eager.

When you sift the wide ring of chalk dust around the stair-mouth, the dust doesn’t drift evenly. It crawls in three behaviors at once:

- Along the *outer* edge of the ring, it creeps clockwise, slow and steady, as if the air itself is turning.
- At two points—left and down-left—the dust pulls inward in thin tongues, drawn toward the stair like breath.
- Directly in front of the lowest visible step, the chalk lies dead-still, as if pressed flat by an unseen palm.

That still patch is your answer: something is occupying that space, displacing air without moving it.

Kest leans, squinting hard into the stair-mouth. “Heat—yes,” he says, voice muffled by cloak. “Not body heat. Like a kettle left near-boil.” He jerks his chin at the dead-still chalk. “There. It’s bending the light—barely. Like looking through greasy glass.”

As he speaks, the scrape below becomes a deliberate *tap… tap… tap*—metal on stone—counting. The nail is being tested against the steps, like someone checking its weight and edge.

Then the dead-still patch in your chalk ring shifts forward by half a step.

A pressure touches the underside of your boot—*not* lifting it, but feeling for the chalk-pouch through leather, like a fingertip finding a pulse.

The wardens make a small, involuntary sound behind their cloth. Kest clamps a hand on the nearer one’s jaw to keep it shut. “It’s right at the lip,” he says. “And it’s reaching.”

### Turn 58 [PLAYER]

I slowly ease my boot off the chalk-pouch—keeping the cord looped tight in my fingers—and slide the pouch back to Kest with a sharp hand signal to stow it sealed. With my other hand I flick the spare iron pin a pace closer to the stair-mouth, then drag a thick chalk bar straight across the lip like a threshold and whisper through clenched teeth, “Watch the still patch—does it follow the iron or the chalk?”

*Agent reasoning: It’s probing for my chalk; I need to deny it the tithe and learn its boundary without feeding it breath or a name. A decoy offering placed away from us might pull it back, while we reinforce the lip and prepare to retreat if it surges.*

### Turn 59 [GAME]

As your boot lifts, the pressure under it vanishes—then returns immediately, sharper, as if whatever’s at the lip has been waiting for that exact surrender.

You keep the cord looped tight and slide the chalk-pouch back. Kest catches it without looking away from the stair-mouth. He yanks open his satchel with his teeth, stuffs the pouch inside, and snaps the flap shut under his palm like he’s smothering a candle. He gives you a curt nod: sealed, contained.

You flick the spare iron pin closer.

The pin skitters, then stops dead a handspan from the lip—like it hit invisible tar. For a heartbeat it trembles in place, vibrating so fast it blurs, and the scrape below answers with a pleased little *tap* on stone.

You drag the thick chalk bar across the stair-lip. The chalk screams faintly on brick and leaves a bold threshold line—too thick to be subtle, too clean to be ignored.

The “still patch” reacts in two distinct ways:

- It does **not** follow the chalk. The chalk line holds its shape; dust near it settles as if the air has decided to behave.
- It **does** recoil from the iron. The dead-still area snaps back a fraction when the pin stops, as if the iron has suddenly become a hot brand.

Kest watches, eyes narrowed. “It hates the iron,” he says. “Chalk’s just… a rule it can negotiate.”

Then the pin, still stuck in “tar,” begins to slide on its own—inch by inch—toward the stair-mouth, against the grain of the stone. Not pulled by gravity; drawn.

From below, the metal-on-stone tapping becomes a single, careful *drag*, like someone drawing a blade along a step. The nail you dropped is being used as a tool down there.

At the lip, the air warps—greasy-glass shimmer—right where your chalk threshold crosses. Something presses against the threshold from the underside. The chalk line smears in one spot, not from your hand, but from contact: a rounded edge pushing up, testing if the “rule” breaks.

Kest shifts his stance, keeping the wardens tight. “Eirwen,” he says low, “it’s trying to come *through* the line. And it’s using the pin to bait a crossing.”

“Don’t move—no one crosses that chalk.” I hook the spare iron pin with the tip of my iron compass (staying well back from the lip) and try to drag it away from the stair-mouth, keeping the compass between me and the shimmer. “Kest, keep that pouch sealed—if it reaches again, stamp the satchel shut and back up. Wardens: eyes on the smear; if it bulges, shout—no words, just noise.”

*Agent reasoning: It recoils from iron but can negotiate chalk; I should reinforce iron barriers, avoid stepping over the threshold, and prevent it from pulling the pin or using the nail as leverage. I also need more intel without giving it names or breath.*

### Turn 61 [GAME]

“No one crosses,” you hiss—and for a moment, the stair-mouth feels like a held breath.

You hook the spare iron pin with the tip of your iron compass and pull.

The compass bites the pin with a clean *click*—iron on iron—and the pin jerks free of the invisible “tar” with a sound like tearing cloth. It skates back toward you a full pace, scraping sparks from the brick.

The shimmer at the lip reacts immediately: it *flinches* away from the compass-point like it’s been struck. The bulge under the chalk threshold collapses, and the smeared spot on the line stops moving.

But the release has consequences.

From below, the tapping stops. Silence—thick, listening silence—then a wet, deliberate *inhale* rises up the stairwell, as if the stair itself is drawing breath. The chalk dust ring you laid earlier shivers and begins to creep inward in thin threads toward the lip, as though something is drinking the air through the crack.

Kest does exactly what you told him: he keeps the satchel hugged to his ribs, one boot ready to stomp the flap. He backs a half-step without breaking the shoulder-contact chain with the wardens. “Sealed,” he mutters. “I’m not letting it smell it.”

The two wardens lock their eyes on the smear. When the chalk line *dimples*—a shallow, thumbprint depression forming from beneath—they don’t speak. They make noise: one barks a harsh, wordless shout; the other slaps his own cheekplate hard enough to ring. The sound is ugly and loud in the tight brick throat.

The dimple pauses, as if startled.

Then, in response to the noise, the shimmer changes tactics: it doesn’t push up anymore. It slides sideways along the underside of your chalk threshold, searching for an edge—an end to the line, a gap, a place where “no crossing” becomes “around.”

You can see it now by what it does to the dust: a moving absence, a thumb-sized void traveling left along the lip, hugging the chalk like a thief hugging a wall.

Threat, clear and immediate: whatever is at the stair-mouth cannot comfortably pass iron, can press and test chalk, and is now trying to **bypass your threshold by slipping around it** rather than breaking through.

Your compass hand tingles—faint numbness in the fingertips that held the iron point closest to the shimmer—like you dipped them in cold ash.

“Back another step—still paired,” I tell them, keeping my voice tight. I shake out my numb compass hand once, then plant the iron compass point-down on the stone to my left like a spike, and with my other hand I draw a fresh chalk line from my existing threshold straight to the compass—making a hooked corner—then ask Kest, “Any loose iron we can lay as a continuous edge? Chain, nails, keys—anything long.”

*Agent reasoning: It’s trying to go around my chalk line; iron makes it flinch. I need to extend the barrier with iron without stepping close, and I want more information about how far it can travel along the lip. Also my numb fingers are a warning—limit exposure and keep everyone paired and back.*

### Turn 63 [GAME]

They back up another step in the tight little chain Kest forced—boots scraping, cloaks pulling. The stair-mouth stays where it is, but the *sense* of it crawls forward, like a smell you can’t outwalk.

You shake your hand once. The numbness doesn’t leave; it breaks into pins-and-needles and then settles into a dull, cold ache in the first two fingers—as if the iron conducted something into you rather than away.

You plant the iron compass point-down to your left. The stone answers with a crisp *tick* and a faint vibration up the shaft. For half a second, the greasy shimmer at the lip twitches toward the compass like it’s noticed a candle in a dark room—then recoils again, wary.

You draw a fresh chalk line from the threshold to the compass, making a hooked corner—an L-shaped “no-around” that turns the lip into a penned edge.

Outcome: the moving void under the threshold reaches the corner, hesitates, and stops. It can’t “slide” past the bend as easily; your hook forces it to choose between pressing through chalk (risky, slow) or approaching the iron spike (pain).

But the hook creates a new pressure point: the chalk at the corner begins to **powder** on its own, grains lifting as if teased by breath from below. Something is testing the corner with suction rather than force.

Kest answers your question without taking his eyes off the lip. He pats himself down fast. “Keys,” he says, then swears. “Not long. Two nails in my boot-sole, and a clasp.” He jerks his chin at the wardens. “You two—iron?”

One warden fumbles at his belt and comes up with a short thorn-iron rosary chain—maybe a foot long—beads like tiny burrs. The other has three warding nails and a cracked iron buckle.

As the rosary chain comes into view, the shimmer at the lip reacts hard: the void retreats a full handspan from your chalk corner, and the air in the stairwell gives a thin, angry *hiss*, like steam hitting cold metal.

Threat, immediate and concrete: it’s now fixated on the iron objects. The suction at the chalk corner weakens, but the shimmer shifts lower, as if preparing to lunge at whichever hand brings iron closest to the lip—trying to snatch or foul it.

### Turn 64 [PLAYER]

“Good—rosary chain, on the floor, not in your hand.” I motion the warden to lay it down with his boot, linking it from my iron compass spike toward the chalked threshold to make a continuous iron boundary. With my aching fingers I pinch a fresh scatter of chalk dust and salt it thick at the corner that’s powdering, then to Kest I murmur, “If it lunges, we drop iron and retreat—no heroics. Do you hear breath, steps, or just that hiss?”

*Agent reasoning: The thing recoils from iron but may lunge to snatch it; I should extend an iron “edge” without putting hands near the lip, and reinforce the chalk corner before suction erodes it.*

### Turn 65 [GAME]

The warden with the rosary chain goes pale at the idea of touching it near the lip, but he obeys. He crouches without breaking the paired line, hooks the chain with the toe of his boot, and *shuffles* it forward bead by bead.

As the thorn-iron beads scrape stone, the shimmer under the threshold reacts like a cat to a thrown pan: it snaps back from the edge, and the greasy-glass distortion thins, retreating down the first step where you can’t quite see it. The stairwell’s air pressure equalizes with an audible *whuff*.

He links the chain from your compass-spike toward the chalk threshold. The moment the last bead touches near your chalk line, the effect becomes continuous: the moving void that had been probing the corner simply… stops existing in that strip. Dust no longer creeps toward the bend. The powdering chalk at the corner settles.

You salt the corner thick with chalk dust. Your aching fingers leave faint gray smears on your skin; the cold ache deepens for a beat, then stabilizes—like the pain has found a comfortable seat in your knuckles.

Kest leans in just enough to answer without raising his voice. “Breath,” he says. “Not steps. Like something big learning to breathe through a keyhole.” He tilts his head, listening. “And—listen—there’s a second sound under the hiss.”

You all hear it then: a soft, rhythmic *tink… tink… tink…* from below, metal lightly striking stone. Not your pin (it’s back by you). Not the chain (it’s still).

The threat clarifies itself: whatever is down there has its own iron—or has found something metal—and it’s testing it against the stair, trying to understand the boundary you’ve made. The hiss returns, quieter now, threaded with irritation rather than hunger.

The wardens keep their eyes on the smear and the chain line. One gives you a tight, wordless nod: the iron edge is working—for the moment.

### Turn 66 [PLAYER]

I hold up two fingers—silent—then point at the stair and mime “listening,” keeping everyone still. In a low whisper to Kest: “That *tink*—is it a loose nail like mine, or a longer scrape like a tool?” Then I gesture the wardens to use their boot-tips to lay the extra nails and buckle along any gaps in our iron line, and I mark our retreat path with a quick chalk arrow back from the stair so no one turns alone if it surges.

*Agent reasoning: The iron boundary is holding, but the entity is testing metal below; I should confirm what metal it has and reinforce without approaching the lip, while preparing an orderly retreat if the boundary fails.*

### Turn 67 [GAME]

Everyone freezes on your two-finger signal. Even Kest stops breathing for a count, lips parted like he’s afraid the air will give him away.

The *tink… tink…* continues—steady, patient. You point, mime listening.

Kest angles his ear toward the stair and answers in a breath-thin whisper. “Tool,” he says. “Not a drop. It’s placed—lifted—placed. Like someone tapping the head of a nail to find hollow spots.” He swallows. “And it’s moving *up*, one tap at a time.”

You gesture the wardens to close the iron line. They obey with boot-tips: the three warding nails laid head-to-point in a staggered row where the rosary chain doesn’t quite meet your chalk; the cracked iron buckle set flat to bridge a handspan gap. As each piece of iron touches down, the shimmer you can’t quite see *recedes* a fraction, as if the stair-mouth is being pushed back by an invisible pressure.

Your chalk arrow goes down fast—sharp, practical—pointing the retreat route away from the lip. The chalk takes cleanly, and the arrow’s tip seems to “catch” the lanternlight, making it easy to follow even in the stairwell’s uneven glow.

Consequence: the tapping below changes immediately. It stops for two beats—listening—then resumes, but closer and faster, as if whoever (or whatever) is doing it has recognized you’re reinforcing a boundary and is hurrying.

Then a new sound joins it: a long, careful *scrrrk*—metal dragged lightly along brick—testing for an edge, a seam, a place where iron ends and chalk begins.

The threat is no longer just the shimmer at the lip. There is an **active presence below** using metal like a probe and advancing toward your threshold, apparently trying to **map your barrier by sound and touch**.

One of the wardens whispers, too loud despite himself, “That’s… that’s a hand down there.”

Kest’s response is immediate and physical: he tightens his grip on the satchel and shifts his stance behind the paired line, ready to backstep on your arrow without turning. “No one breaks,” he murmurs. “If it shows fingers, we don’t bargain with them.”

### Turn 68 [PLAYER]

I exhale slow and whisper, “We don’t let it learn the line.” Then I flick a tight hand signal: lantern down and away—no light on the lip—and order, “Backstep on the arrow, paired, no turning; keep iron on the floor as we go.”  

As we retreat, I pinch and throw a last heavy scatter of chalk dust across the corner and any seam near the iron chain—like blinding grit—then murmur to Kest, “If it crosses the chalk anyway, we drop everything and run; but we do not split.”

*Agent reasoning: It’s probing for a gap and advancing; we should deny it information and avoid a close confrontation. Best is a controlled retreat while leaving a deterrent and keeping our paired formation intact, rather than waiting for it to touch the threshold.*

### Turn 69 [GAME]

Kest snaps his lantern-hand down and angles the hood away from the stair-mouth. The light falls to your boots and the chalk arrow instead of the lip. The wardens follow suit—no one argues, just the quick, stiff obedience of people who’ve learned what “too much seeing” costs.

You all backstep on the arrow in pairs, shoulders nearly touching, never turning your backs. The iron stays on the floor: chain, nails, buckle—left behind as a low, ugly boundary.

Your last scatter of chalk dust goes thick across the corner and the seam by the rosary beads. It hits the stone like flour on wet hands; some of it clings, some of it skitters in a small white wave toward the threshold.

Immediate outcome: the *scrrrk* below falters. The probing metal drags once more, then stops, as if the grit has taken away the clean “edge” it was reading. The tapping resumes—but now it’s irregular, frustrated, searching for the line it just lost.

You’re three backsteps away when the lip answers anyway.

A shape rises into the dim—not the whole thing, just what it dares to extend: a **hand** made of soot-dark sinew and too-many joints, fingers thin as quills. It doesn’t breach the iron strip; it hovers just behind it, testing the air. Where your chalk dust hangs on the stone, the fingertips twitch and recoil, as if the powder stings.

Then it changes tactics. The hand hooks something metal from below—its own tool—and slides it forward *under* the iron line, trying to push it across without crossing itself.

The tool’s tip emerges: a long nail or awl, blackened, with a flattened head. It scratches at the chalk corner you salted, attempting to carve a clean channel through the powder.

Kest sees it and obeys your instruction to the letter—no heroics. “Back. Back—now,” he whispers, voice tight. The wardens backstep with you, paired, keeping formation.

Consequence: the iron boundary holds, but the presence below has learned it can **reach with a tool**. As you retreat, the scratching continues behind you, steady and methodical—trying to cut a path through chalk rather than cross iron.

No one splits. No one runs yet. But you can hear, clearly, that it’s working.

### Turn 70 [PLAYER]

“Keep backing—same pace—don’t listen to the scratching,” I whisper, forcing my eyes to the chalk arrow and not the hand. “Next landing or doorframe, we make a hard stop.”

Once we reach the nearest junction, I have the wardens set their remaining iron (anything not already down) in a tight crescent across our side of the corridor, then I ask Kest, “Do we have wax, pitch, or oil? Something we can smear into a seam—chalk it, then seal it—so it can’t ‘cut a line’ clean.”

*Agent reasoning: It can’t cross iron but can use a tool to cut chalk; we need distance and a more permanent seal, plus information on what kind of entity uses iron probes. Retreat to a defensible junction, prepare to collapse/lock the stair, and avoid giving it time to “solve” the boundary.*

### Turn 71 [GAME]

You keep the pace. You do not look back. The scratching becomes a kind of hateful metronome behind you, and for a moment it tries to match your retreat—as if it can measure distance by your footsteps—but you deny it that rhythm by keeping your backsteps even and quiet.

You reach the nearest junction: a low landing where the stairwell throat meets a side corridor of sweating brick. A doorframe sits there too—old oak banded in iron, swollen shut, its lock packed with candle-wax from some past attempt to sanctify it.

“Hard stop,” you whisper.

The two wardens move fast and low. Anything iron they still have goes down on *your* side of the corridor in a tight crescent: a short length of thorn-iron nail strip (meant for pinning ward-cloth), two loose nails, and a bent clasp pulled from one warden’s belt pouch. They set it so there’s no easy straight line to read—overlapping, staggered, ugly. The air near the crescent feels immediately less “slippery,” like the corridor has regained friction.

Kest keeps his body between you and the stair mouth while answering your question. He pats his own satchel once, then hisses a quiet curse. “No wax. No pitch.” He taps the lantern. “Oil, yes—lamp oil. But not much.” He nods toward the swollen door. “And there’s old wax in that lock… if you’re willing to pry it out.”

Behind you, from the stair throat, the scratching stops.

A beat later: *tink… tink… tink* again—closer than it should be if it stayed at the lip. Not in the corridor with you, but at the bend where the stair meets the junction, like it has advanced its tool-hand to the corner.

Then the metal-drag returns—soft, deliberate—this time not trying to cut your old chalk line, but **feeling along the brickwork at junction height**, searching for a new seam, a new “clean edge” to learn.

The threat is now clear: it can’t cross your iron, but it can **probe around it and attempt to establish a new line** at the junction. If it finds an unbroken seam to “read,” it may start cutting here instead.

### Turn 72 [PLAYER]

“Quiet—no one steps past the crescent.” I crouch at the swollen door, keep my shoulder pressed to Kest’s side so we stay paired, and use the iron compass point to pry out a lump of the old wax from the lock. 

I smear the wax into the most obvious brick seam at junction height (the one the dragging seems to favor), then dust it heavily with chalk and press it flat with the side of my thumb to make it irregular and unreadable. “Kest—drip a *thread* of oil over this, just enough to slick it, not enough to run; wardens, keep your iron staggered and add chalk smears along any straight mortar line you can reach without breaking formation.”

*Agent reasoning: It’s probing for a new seam; we need to deny it clean edges and seal what we can without wasting oil. Wax from the lock is a ready sealant, and we should reinforce with chalk/iron while keeping formation and not getting too close to the bend.*

### Turn 73 [GAME]

“No one past,” Kest echoes, and plants his boot heel against the nearest iron strip like he’s bracing a door. The wardens hold the crescent line, shoulders squared inward so nobody’s silhouette offers the stair throat a clean profile.

You crouch at the swollen oak door. The lock is crusted with old candle-wax—gray-yellow, grit-studded. With the iron compass point you lever at it. It doesn’t come free politely; it comes out in a stubborn plug that pops loose with a small, sharp *tck*.

At the junction height seam—where the metal-drag has been worrying the brick—you smear the wax hard into the mortar crack. It fills the groove and bulges unevenly. You dust it with chalk until it’s pale and thick, then press and scuff it with your thumb, flattening the surface into a lumpy, fingerprinted mess—no straight edge, no clean channel.

Outcome: the *scrrrk* from the stair throat stops almost immediately, as if the probing tool has lost the “readable” seam it was tracking. The tapping starts again—two quick taps, then a pause—like someone testing for resonance and getting none.

“Kest—oil,” you murmur.

He cracks the lantern’s oil cap with careful fingers and drips exactly what you asked for: a thin thread across the wax-chalk patch. It slicks the surface without running. The chalk darkens in a narrow, wet vein and clumps, turning granular and uneven. The seam becomes not just unreadable, but unpleasant to touch.

The wardens smear chalk along reachable straight mortar lines—quick palm swipes and thumb-scrapes—keeping their hips behind the crescent. One of them whispers, “Lines broken,” like a charm.

Consequence: the presence adapts again. The metal-drag resumes, but higher—along the *iron banding of the swollen door*—a slow, patient scrape as it searches for another clean boundary. Then you hear something worse: a faint, wet *sniff*—not a nose exactly, but air pulled through a narrow gap—sampling the corridor.

A thin black point—like the tip of that awl—edges into view at the corner, stops short of the crescent, and makes a tiny, precise scratch on the brick *above* your waxed seam.

It is testing new marks, trying to establish a fresh “line” where you haven’t fouled the surface yet.

### Turn 74 [PLAYER]

“Don’t let it draw,” I whisper, and smear a rough palmful of chalk in a wide, messy oval over the fresh scratch and the brick above it—no straight strokes, just blotches. Then I take the remaining lock-wax and thumb it in uneven ridges along the door’s iron banding where it’s scraping, dusting that wax with chalk as well.  

To Kest, low: “How much corridor do we have behind us before the next junction—and is there a second exit or only back the way we came?”

*Agent reasoning: It’s trying to create a new clean reference line above our seal; I should deny it any straight, readable surface and avoid engaging directly. Also, the door’s iron banding is a new “edge” it can read—better to foul that too and consider a controlled withdrawal if it keeps adapting.*

### Turn 75 [GAME]

Your chalk goes on like a bruise—wide, blotchy, no clean edge to follow. The fresh scratch disappears under a gritty oval, and the brick above it becomes a smeared field of fingerprint swirls and broken powder.

Immediate outcome: the awl-tip at the corner pauses. It makes one tentative, tiny *tick* against the chalked patch, then withdraws a hair’s breadth, as if the texture isn’t giving it anything consistent to “learn.”

You turn to the door’s iron banding where it’s been scraping and thumb the remaining lock-wax into uneven ridges along the metal—lumps, crescents, little torn peaks. You dust those ridges with chalk until the banding looks furred and diseased.

Consequence: the scrape on the iron banding stops. Not defeated—redirected. The metal-drag shifts to the adjacent brick again, searching for a new clean run.

Then the thing tries something you haven’t blocked yet: a soft, measured *tap… tap… tap* on the floor, just behind the corner—like it’s sounding for hollow space, for a gap under the brickwork where iron crescents don’t matter.

Kest answers without moving his feet, voice kept to the inside of your pairing. “Behind us—about twenty paces before the next junction. After that, it doglegs into the soot alleys.” He flicks two fingers toward the swollen door. “Second exit is *that*—if it opens. Otherwise it’s back the way we came.”

One of the wardens, still holding the crescent line, adds in a clipped whisper, “Door’s old clergy storage. Usually sealed from this side.”

As Kest speaks, the tapping on the floor becomes more certain, moving left to right in short increments, mapping the stones in front of your crescent as if it’s looking for the one that shifts.

Threat, clear: it can’t cross the iron crescent directly, but it may be trying to find (or create) a **gap from below**—a loose floorstone, a drain seam, anything it can use to bring its tool through on your side.

### Turn 76 [PLAYER]

“Floor’s the next line—don’t give it a seam,” I whisper. I have the wardens smear chalk in broad, messy patches over the floor joints in front of the crescent (no straight runs), while I test the swollen door: palm flat for vibration, then a careful pull at the latch and a slow shoulder-press, listening for any give or hidden catch. “Kest—if it shifts a stone, call it; and tell me if you’ve got anything thin we can jam under a loose slab—knife, wedge, even a nail.”

*Agent reasoning: It’s shifting to the floor to bypass our crescent, so I need to deny it any predictable gap and avoid getting pinned here. The safest move is to keep formation, foul the floor seams with chalk, and try the door as a secondary escape without splitting the group.*

### Turn 77 [GAME]

The wardens obey instantly, dropping to one knee without letting their torsos cross the crescent. They smear chalk in ugly, broad handprints over the floor joints just beyond the iron—no straight lines, no neat borders. The pale patches turn the stonework into a muddled map of palms and scuffs.

Outcome: the *tap… tap… tap* from the far side falters. Whatever is sounding the floor tests one chalk-smeared joint and gets only a gritty slide—no crisp seam to “count.” The tapping shifts a half-step away, searching for an unchalked gap.

You put your palm flat on the swollen door. The oak is cold-damp and faintly alive with vibration: not a heartbeat, more like pressure moving through old grain. When the distant bells toll above, the vibration sharpens—then eases—like the door is part of the cathedral’s breathing.

You try the latch. It has a catch—hidden, not locked. Your careful pull lifts it a fraction, then stops dead against swelling wood. When you shoulder-press slowly, the door gives you the smallest surrender: a thin *creak* and a breath of air from the other side that smells of old linen, ash, and dried incense.

But it’s not open. It’s *separated*—barely—by a finger’s width at the jamb before the wood binds again.

“Kest—if it shifts a stone, call it; and—”

Kest’s head snaps toward the floor. “Stone,” he says immediately.

A single slab just beyond the crescent—near the leftmost iron strip—twitches. Not lifting, not sliding out, but rocking as if something underneath has found purchase. A hairline of darkness appears at one edge, then vanishes when the slab settles back.

Kest fishes at his belt. “Knife—no. Wedge—no.” He yanks free a straight thorn-iron nail and holds it up between two fingers. “This. And a clasp pin.”

The threat is now specific and close: something below the floor is testing for a slab it can lever from *underneath*, trying to open a seam on your side of the crescent. If it gets even a fingertip-width gap, it can start “drawing” from below where your chalk smears can’t stop its tool.

### Turn 78 [PLAYER]

I take the thorn-iron nail and, without crossing the crescent, hammer it down with the heel of my palm into the hairline gap at the slab’s edge the moment it twitches again—using it as a pin to stop any lift. “Clasp pin too—jam it beside, crosswise. If the stone moves, we drive both deeper.”

Then I lean to Kest, voice tight: “Help me—on three, we force the door. Slow pressure, no sudden swing.” I set my shoulder to the swollen oak again and breathe, listening for that hidden catch as I press: “One… two… three.”

*Agent reasoning: The floor slab is starting to give; I need to stop it from levering up from below while we still have formation. A quick pin/wedge and more iron contact should deny a gap, then we should use the barely-open door as a safer second route rather than risk the corridor.*

### Turn 79 [GAME]

The slab twitches again—left edge this time, a sharper rock like something below has found a better lever.

You drop the thorn-iron nail into the hairline the instant it opens and drive it down with the heel of your palm. It bites with a gritty *crunch*—stone grit, mortar dust—then seats hard. The slab tries to lift and can’t; the movement turns into a frustrated tremor that rattles through the floor into your knees.

“Pin,” Kest breathes, approval clipped. He slides the bent clasp pin into the same edge, crosswise, and you both shove it down together. The pin doesn’t go deep—too bent—but it wedges, catching the nail and turning the edge into a bristling, ugly little trap.

Consequence: whatever is underneath changes tactics. The pressure shifts away from the pinned edge and you feel—through the soles of your boots—a series of small, searching pushes along the neighboring joints, as if it’s looking for an easier slab to worry.

You lean into Kest. “On three.”

He comes in close on your right, shoulder to wood, careful not to break the crescent line with his feet. The wardens tighten their crescent, chalky hands hovering over the floor joints like they’re ready to smear again at any new twitch.

“One… two… three.”

You both apply slow, steady pressure. The swollen oak complains—long, reluctant creaks—and the hidden catch you felt earlier gives way with a muted *clack* that you hear more than feel.

The door opens a handspan.

Not a room—an inky, narrow storage passage. Linen-wrapped bundles stacked too high. A saint’s niche inside, face turned to the wall as if in shame. And a draft that runs *upward*, toward the bells, carrying the dry-sweet stink of incense and something coppery under it.

Immediate danger: as the gap widens, the metal-drag behind the corner stops. In its place comes a thin, eager *scrape*—not on the floor now, but on the **threshold** of the storage passage, like whatever is out there has realized you’re making a new line it can reach.

Kest freezes mid-push. “It heard that,” he murmurs. “Keep it controlled.”

At your feet, the pinned slab shudders once—then goes still. The pressure underneath has moved.

Something is now repositioning to reach the new opening you’ve created.

### Turn 80 [PLAYER]

“Hold—don’t open it further yet,” I whisper, then smear chalk in a thick, ugly band across the threshold and the doorjamb as far in as I can reach without crossing the crescent, scuffing it with my thumb to break any straight edge. “Warden—eyes on the floor joints; call the first twitch.”

To Kest, low: “Do we have cloth or cord? If we can’t seal it, we at least leash the door so it can’t swing wide—then we peek for a second exit or a place to set iron inside.”

*Agent reasoning: Opening the door created a new “clean line” at the threshold; I need to foul that line before widening the gap, and avoid stepping through until we know what’s inside and whether the thing can reach around. I’ll also keep the iron crescent intact and have someone watch the floor for a new lift point.*

### Turn 81 [GAME]

You stop the door with your forearm and smear chalk across the threshold—thick, ugly, thumb-scuffed. You drag the chalk up the jamb as far as you can reach without stepping over the crescent, breaking any straight run into blotches and torn arcs.

Outcome: the thin *scrape* that had started on the threshold stutters, then shifts to a hesitant, searching rasp along the outer edge of the door—like a blade trying to find a clean line to “take.” It doesn’t find one immediately.

The nearer warden plants his palm on the floor and watches the joints like a hawk. “I’ve got it,” he whispers.

Kest answers your question by ripping a strip of cloth from inside his cloak—lining or bandage, you can’t tell—and produces a length of thin cord that had been tied around a wax-sealed packet at his belt. “Cloth and cord,” he says. “Not much.”

As he speaks, the floor gives a warning you can feel before it’s seen: a faint, rising pressure under the chalk-smeared stones to your right—*not* the pinned slab. The watching warden snaps, “Twitch—right joint!”

A seam two stones over from your nail-pinned slab lifts a hair, enough to exhale a thread of dust. Something below is trying a new point—probing for the first unpinned edge it can lever.

Inside the storage passage, beyond the half-open door, the saint’s niche makes a dry, granular sound—as if grit is sliding in its throat. The statue’s turned head doesn’t move, but a whisper leaks out anyway, faint through the crack: “Eir… wen…”

Threats, clear and immediate:
- Below-floor pressure is relocating and testing other slabs for a lift.
- The thing outside is now feeling along the door’s edge, looking for a clean threshold line to catch.
- The half-open door is an invitation; if it swings wider uncontrolled, you’ll give it a bigger surface to work.

Kest keeps his voice low, already looping cord around the door handle. “I can leash it to the iron ring on the jamb. But you’ll have to decide—do we commit inside, or do we shut it and reinforce the floor first?”

I grab the strip of cloth, wad it, and shove it into the twitching right joint as a grimy plug, then smear chalk over it to foul the seam; if it lifts again, I drive the clasp pin into that edge too. Without stepping past the crescent, I angle my lantern low and take a careful peek through the crack—just enough to spot an inner iron hook, ring, or any second way out.

*Agent reasoning: The floor threat is actively relocating, so we need immediate stabilization; the half-open door is also a liability unless leashed. Committing inside blind is risky, but a controlled peek could reveal an inner iron anchor or second exit. Secure the door first, then pin the new slab, then take a minimal look inside without breaking formation.*

### Turn 83 [GAME]

Kest nods once and works fast. He loops the thin cord through the door’s inner handle (caught through the crack with two fingers) and cinches it back to an iron ring set into the jamb on your side. He ties it off short—when the door tries to ease wider under its own swell, the cord catches and holds it at roughly a handspan. The oak shudders against the leash and stops.

You wad the strip of cloth and cram it into the twitching right joint. It goes in with resistance—grit and old mortar bite your knuckles—then seats. You smear chalk over it, thumb-scuffing hard to foul the seam.

Outcome: the seam stops “breathing” dust. The pressure from below tests once, meets cloth and chalk, and withdraws—at least for the moment.

But the floor doesn’t go quiet. Two joints farther along—closer to the wall—give a faint, synchronized *tick* as if something under there has shifted its weight sideways, hunting for a seam you haven’t plugged.

You keep the clasp pin ready, then angle your lantern low and peek through the handspan crack.

Inside the clergy storage passage: bundles of linen and votive cloth stacked tight; a narrow walkway; and, immediately to the right just inside, an iron wall-hook with a looped chain—meant for hanging censers or securing a door. Farther in, you spot a second exit: not a door, but a low service hatch near the floor at the passage’s end, its edges blackened with soot like it opens into the alleys or a chimney-run.

As your lanternlight crawls across the saint’s niche, you see why the statue faces the wall: its mouth has been stitched shut with thin wire, but the wire is slack—as if it’s been worried at from the inside. The whisper still leaks through, grit-soft: “Map…maker…”

Immediate threat: from the outer hall (your side), the earlier metal-drag returns—closer now—and something hard taps the **door edge** just above your chalk smear, testing the wood itself since the threshold line is fouled. One, two taps—then a slow scraping climb, like a hooked tool feeling for the cord.

Kest’s eyes flick to the leash. “It’s looking for the tie,” he says, voice flat. “If it cuts that cord, the door’s going to spring.”

### Turn 84 [PLAYER]

“Kest—switch the leash to that chain inside, now. Keep the gap the same; don’t let the door spring.”  

I smear fresh chalk thick over the cord and knot area to foul any clean cut, then reach in through the crack as far as I safely can and try to snag the looped chain onto the inner handle or hook so the door’s held by iron instead of cord. “Warden—cover those two ticking joints with blotch-chalk; if either lifts, I’ll pin it.”

*Agent reasoning: The cord is a vulnerability; if it’s cut, the door may fly open and give the thing a clean line. I should replace the leash with something it can’t easily sever and keep fouling seams as it searches.*

### Turn 85 [GAME]

Kest moves the instant you say it—one hand braced on the door so it can’t surge, the other working the cord’s knot. “Hold it steady,” he mutters, and leans his weight into the oak to keep the gap fixed at a handspan.

You smear fresh chalk over the cord and knot, turning the tie-point into a gummy, broken-edged mess. The scraping outside pauses when it hits the chalked cord—then resumes higher, choosing wood over fiber.

You reach in through the crack, shoulder burning as you keep your boots behind the crescent. Your fingers find the iron looped chain on the wall-hook just inside. It’s heavier than it looked, cold and greasy with old incense soot. You drag it off the hook link by link, trying not to clink it.

It clinks anyway—one small, traitorous *tink*.

Inside the passage, the wire-sewn saint exhales a sound like sand in a throat. The whisper sharpens, closer than it should be: “Don’t…unhook…me.”

Kest hisses, “Ignore it.”

You manage to snake the chain toward the inner handle. The first attempt slips—your fingertips skid on the greasy links—and the chain drops, striking the stone floor inside with a dull *chank*.

Immediate consequence: the two “ticking” floor joints behind you answer as if they heard a cue. Both lift a hair at once—enough to spit dust. The watching warden blots chalk over them fast, palm-smearing ugly circles. “They’re up—barely!”

At the door edge, the hooked scraping finds the cord at last. There’s a sharp *twang* as something catches and pulls. The door jerks against Kest’s brace; the cord holds, but it’s under tension now—one good slice away from failure.

You try again with the chain, teeth clenched. This time you get a link over the inner handle, then another—enough that the chain takes some of the load. You feel the door’s pressure shift: less on the cord, more on iron.

Kest doesn’t relax. “Chain’s on,” he confirms, eyes on the leash point. “But it’s not anchored yet—if that hook outside yanks hard, it’ll still rip the handle or drag the chain loose.”

In the outer hall, whatever is there changes rhythm: no more delicate scraping. A firm, deliberate pull tests the door—once—then again, stronger, like it’s realized you’re trying to make the opening *permanent*.

The threat is clear: the cord may snap or be cut, and the chain—only half-seated—could be torn free, letting the door spring wide. Meanwhile, the floor joints you just blotted are “awake,” responding to sound and movement with coordinated lifts.

### Turn 86 [PLAYER]

“Kest—keep bracing. Wardens, silence—no more kneeling shuffles; just chalk if it lifts.”

I hook more chain over the inner handle, then try to draw the chain back out through the crack and loop it around the jamb ring on our side, so the door’s leashed by iron-to-iron; if it won’t reach, I tie the cord to the chain as a sacrificial link and keep smearing chalk over any exposed cut-line. “If it yanks again, we let it take cord—not the door.”

*Agent reasoning: The door is about to be forced; the cord is a weak point. I need an all-iron restraint anchored to something solid without stepping past the crescent, and I should minimize noise to keep the floor-thing from coordinating. The saint’s whisper is a possible lure—ignore for now.*

### Turn 87 [GAME]

Kest’s shoulder locks harder into the oak. He doesn’t answer—just shifts his feet so the door can’t surge even if the leash fails.

The wardens go statue-still. One stays crouched with chalk ready, but he stops scraping his knee across the stone. The other keeps his palm hovering over the blotted joints, eyes flicking between seams.

You hook more chain over the inner handle until it sits like a rough collar. Then you start feeding it back toward you through the crack.

Outcome: it *won’t* come.

The chain is fixed to the wall-hook inside. You’d pulled it off the hook’s lip, but it’s still threaded through the hook’s loop—like a tether meant to keep whatever it secures from being carried away. When you tug, it bites and holds. The links grind against iron and stone, loud in the narrow passage.

The stitched-mouth saint makes a dry, pleased sound. Not a whisper this time—almost a soft laugh through teeth that shouldn’t move.

Outside, whatever’s on the other side of the door reacts to the grinding: the careful pulls stop. Something changes angle and **rams** the door once—testing your brace. The cord snaps taut with a squeal under the chalk smear; fibers protest but don’t part. The door shudders, but Kest keeps the gap at a handspan.

Your “sacrificial link” idea becomes the only workable version: you tie the cord to a free section of chain you can reach (as close to the handle as your fingers allow), knotting cord around iron links. You smear chalk over the cord where it crosses the door edge, turning it into a paste-slick lump.

Outcome: the leash is now **shared**—cord takes the cutting, chain takes the yanking. The door no longer loads entirely onto the cord.

Consequence: your knot and chalk smear create a thick ridge at the door edge. The hooked tool outside catches that ridge and **saws** at it—chalk flakes snow down, and you hear cord fibers start to fuzz.

Behind you, one of the blotted floor joints lifts again—only a hair, but enough to *click* against the chalk crust. The crouched warden slaps fresh blotch-chalk over it without shifting his knees.

Immediate threats, now clearly defined:
- The thing outside is actively sawing at the cord where it meets the door edge; you have seconds-to-minutes before it parts.
- The chain is anchored inside and can’t be pulled free; if the door is forced wider, the handle could tear or the chain could whip.
- The floor seams are responding to vibration; another loud grind or impact may make more slabs “wake” at once.

### Turn 88 [PLAYER]

“Kest—hold it exactly there. Don’t let it give an inch.”

I stop feeding chalk onto the cord and instead work my fingers through the crack to lift the cord up and *off* the door edge, trying to reposition it so the saw-hook can’t bite—then I whisper, “I’m going to take the cord off entirely if I can.”

Keeping my boots behind the crescent, I reach in and try to re-seat the chain onto the **wall-hook** and then around the **inner handle** in a way that makes a short iron loop that holds the door at a handspan without any cord crossing the edge. “Warden—if any joint lifts more than a hair, call it; I’ll pin the first one that moves.”

*Agent reasoning: The cord is about to be cut; the safest move is to remove the cord from the door-edge entirely and let the chain take the load, but the chain needs a better anchor point inside. I should minimize noise/vibration to avoid waking more slabs, and avoid opening the door further. I’ll use the chain to “lock” the door at this narrow gap by shifting its attachment point so it doesn’t cross the edge where the hook is sawing, and have the wardens ready to pin any lifting joints.*

### Turn 89 [GAME]

Kest grunts—confirmation—and plants his forearm across the door like a bar. The handspan gap stays fixed, trembling under his weight.

You get two fingers onto the cord where it rides the door edge and peel it up, trying to lift it out of the hooked tool’s reach. The chalk paste makes it slippery; the cord shifts… and the sawing outside immediately follows the movement, scraping higher like it can *feel* the tension line.

Then it hooks the cord cleanly.

A hard jerk from the other side yanks the cord down across the edge again. The fibers rasp once—sharp as tearing cloth—

—and the cord **parts**.

For half a heartbeat the door tries to spring wider. Kest catches it with his whole shoulder and a boot heel braced against the threshold. The gap widens maybe a finger, no more, then holds—Kest shaking with the strain.

You don’t have time to mourn the cord. You reach in and work the chain.

Up close, you see the wall-hook inside isn’t just a hook: it’s a **ring-bolt** set into the stone, with the chain permanently captive through it. That’s why it wouldn’t come out. You can’t “re-seat” it so much as choose how it’s routed.

You thread the chain tighter around the inner handle, then back toward the ring-bolt, shortening it link by link. Your fingertips burn as the links grind. You find a link that will catch on the ring-bolt’s lip and you **jam** it there—making a crude iron loop that holds the door at roughly the same handspan.

Outcome: the door is now leashed by **iron only**. No cord crosses the edge anymore.

Consequence: the moment the cord snaps, the hooked tool outside loses its purchase and switches tactics. Metal scrapes the door seam, searching for a gap to pry. The sound is louder than before.

The blotted floor joint nearest the wall lifts more than a hair—enough that you see a thin black line open and a puff of old dust breathe out.

The crouched warden finally speaks, tight and low: “Joint—two fingers from the wall. It’s opening.”

From inside the passage, the stitched-mouth saint’s wire twitches. The whisper comes out pressed flat, like someone speaking through fabric: “Iron…holds…until it doesn’t.”

And outside the door, the prying stops.

Something heavy settles its weight against the oak—quiet, patient pressure—followed by a soft, deliberate **tap** directly on the latch-side, as if it’s measuring where to break you next.

### Turn 90 [PLAYER]

“Good—keep the door leashed and quiet. No one breathes loud.”

I drop to the wall-side seam the warden called and, staying behind the crescent, drive my clasp pin into the opening edge at a slight angle to bite both stones; then I smear blotch-chalk over the joint and my own knuckles to break any clean line. “Kest, on the next tap—don’t fight it with strength. Let it take the chain’s slack, not the latch. I want to see that service hatch—can you angle your light inside without widening the gap?”

*Agent reasoning: The door is temporarily controlled by iron, but the floor seam is actively opening and the outside pressure is shifting to a breaking tactic. I should stabilize the floor first with a pin before anything rises, keep noise down, and avoid committing through the crescent until we have a safer fallback via the service hatch.*

### Turn 91 [GAME]

You drop to the wall-side seam. The crack is breathing dust now—thin, black, and cold against your fingertips. Staying behind the crescent, you slide the bent clasp pin into the opening at a slant and hammer it in with the heel of your hand.

Outcome: the pin bites. Stone grinds on metal, and the seam’s lift stalls—held at a hairline instead of widening. When you smear blotch-chalk over it, the chalk cakes into the crack and around the pin head, making the joint look like an unbroken, ugly smear instead of a clean line.

Consequence: the pressure that *would* have lifted that slab doesn’t vanish. It shifts. Two spans farther down the wall, another seam answers with a faint *tick*—not opening yet, but awake.

You wipe chalk over your knuckles; the grit stings in the raw places, but it does dull the shine of skin and sweat.

At the door, Kest holds his position and nods once without looking away. He slides his lantern-hand lower and angles the shuttered light through the handspan gap without widening it.

You get a brief, clear look into the clergy storage passage:
- The wall-hook you used is a ring-bolt set into stone ribs, chain looped tight to the inner handle as you left it.
- The passage runs straight for several paces, then angles left where shelving throws hard shadows.
- At the far end, near the floor, you catch the edge of the **low service hatch**—a rectangular iron-framed door, its bottom rim crusted with candle-fat and soot. It’s shut.

Before you can study it longer, the heavy weight outside the door shifts.

A **tap** comes—exactly where you predicted—on the latch-side. Kest obeys: he doesn’t muscle against it. He lets the chain take a fraction of slack.

Outcome: the door gives the tiniest controlled shiver, held by iron. The latch doesn’t pop.

Consequence: the chain answers with a sharp *clink* inside the passage—small, but loud in this tight geometry.

The saint-statue inside reacts immediately. Not words—an intake of grit, like a throat clearing. The sound carries down the passage toward the hatch.

Then, from somewhere beyond your lantern’s reach inside, you hear a quiet, answering sound from low to the ground: a **metal fingernail scrape** along the iron frame of the service hatch, as if something on the other side just woke up and put a hand on it.

Threat, now: whatever is outside the main door is coordinating with something inside the passage—something near or behind the service hatch that is responding to sound and vibration.

### Turn 92 [PLAYER]

I press two fingers to Kest’s wrist to still the lantern and whisper, “No more chain clinks—wrap it with cloth if you have any.” Then I lean close to the crack and, keeping my voice barely there, murmur toward the stitched saint, “What are you guarding—hatch or door? Answer with one word.” Finally, I motion a warden forward on hands and knees to slide a chalk-marked pebble (not metal) into the passage—just far enough to reflect lanternlight off the floor toward the service hatch so I can see if it’s moving without stepping over the crescent.

*Agent reasoning: Two threats are coordinating; I need more information without making noise. The hatch entity reacts to vibration, so I should reduce sound, keep the door stable, and scout the hatch visually if possible before committing to entering.*

### Turn 93 [GAME]

Your fingers still Kest’s lantern wrist. The light steadies to a thin, controlled blade through the gap.

Kest doesn’t speak. He shifts his free hand to his belt, fishes out a grimy strip of wrap (old bandage or scarf), and—careful not to jostle the door—reaches as far as he can to wind it around the chain where it meets the inner handle. He can’t reach the ring-bolt, but he mutes the worst of the handle-links. The next tiny door tremor gives only a dull *thud*, not a clink.

You lean toward the crack and murmur to the stitched-mouth saint.

For a moment there’s nothing—then the statue’s wire-stitch twitches, and a single word pushes out, scraped and definite:

“**Hatch.**”

The crouched warden you gesture to goes down on hands and knees without argument. He pinches a small stone from the grit at the threshold, rolls it in chalk until it’s pale, then slides it into the passage with two fingers—slow, deliberate, keeping his hand behind the crescent line.

Outcome: the pebble skitters a foot, then settles. In the lantern’s low angle, it throws a faint reflected glow along the floor toward the far end.

You can see the service hatch more clearly now. It is shut—*but* the soot crust along its bottom rim isn’t intact. A thin line has been freshly disturbed, like something has been dragging a nail or fingertip back and forth in the grit.

Then the hatch’s iron frame gives a tiny inward flex—barely a millimeter—followed by a second, more purposeful scrape from behind it.

Consequence: the sound is quiet, but it’s answered immediately from outside your main door: a slow, satisfied **tap… tap** on the latch-side, as if the thing out there is keeping time with whatever is behind the hatch.

Threat made plain: there is something behind the service hatch testing it from the inside, and something outside your door coordinating pressure and rhythm. If the hatch opens while the door is being timed, you could be caught between two points of entry—one behind your crescent and one in front of it.

The warden freezes on his knees, eyes wide, whispering without looking back: “It moved.”

### Turn 94 [PLAYER]

“Back—slow, no scrape,” I hiss to the kneeling warden, guiding him to retreat the way he came.  

I whisper to Kest, “If it taps, you give it a hair of slack—nothing more; keep it quiet.” Then, staying behind the crescent, I take blotch-chalk and dust it in a thin trail toward the crack—watching the hatch line for any change—while murmuring to the stitched saint, “How do I *bind* it—salt, iron, or silence?”

*Agent reasoning: We’re at risk of a pincer—door pressure timed with hatch movement—so I need to buy time by stopping the hatch without making noise, while keeping everyone behind the crescent and minimizing vibrations.*

### Turn 95 [GAME]

The kneeling warden eases back exactly as told—palms flat, knees sliding, boots never touching down until he’s clear of the crescent. He keeps his belt and scabbard from dragging. The chalked pebble stays where it is inside the passage.

Outside the door: **tap**.

Kest obeys. He gives the door a hair of slack—chain taking it, not latch—so gently the cloth-wrapped links only make a soft, muffled knock. His jaw is clenched hard enough to show white at the corners.

You dust blotch-chalk in a thin trail toward the crack, careful not to cross the crescent. The powder hangs for a heartbeat in the lantern’s sliver, then settles.

Outcome: the chalk trail makes the air’s movement visible. It doesn’t drift toward the door seam; it drifts **toward the wall-side crack** you pinned—like something is sipping breath through stone.

At the far end, by the reflected glow, the service hatch line changes: the disturbed soot at the bottom rim trembles, and a fresh, narrow furrow appears—one slow drag, left to right—like a fingertip tracing a boundary. The hatch doesn’t open, but something behind it is now moving with intent, not just waking.

You murmur your question to the stitched saint.

The wire-stitch twitches twice, then the statue answers with a single word that comes out like grit through teeth:

“**Silence.**”

Consequence: the moment the saint speaks, the door outside answers with a firmer pressure—no tap, just weight settling shoulder-first into oak. The leashed chain holds, but the door bows a fraction inward and stays there, straining.

And from the passage beyond, you hear it: a small, wet click—like a tongue against iron—from behind the service hatch, followed by a faint, testing exhale that makes the chalk on your trail shiver.

Threat, now explicit: whatever is behind the hatch is using sound and breath as a guide. Every spoken word and every scrape is a beacon; the more noise you make, the more precisely it “finds” the seams to worry open.

### Turn 96 [PLAYER]

I clamp my lips shut and raise a flat palm to everyone—*no sound*—then point two fingers at my eyes and the pinned wall seam, circling once to warn it’s drawing breath. I press blotch-chalk into my own spit to make a thick paste and slowly smear it over the pinned crack and its edges to choke the airflow, then lay my gloved hand over it to hold pressure and feel for movement.  

Without speaking, I tap Kest’s forearm twice—*hold steady, no slack unless tapped*—and gesture the wardens to freeze and breathe through cloth, eyes on the hatch line and my chalk trail.

*Agent reasoning: Silence is the binding; speaking and scraping are guiding it. The chalk shows it’s pulling through the pinned seam, so we need to stop airflow and vibration without making noise, and avoid giving the hatch more cues. I’ll signal instead of talk, seal the seam with chalk paste, and have Kest hold steady—no slack unless tapped.*

### Turn 97 [GAME]

Silence drops in like a held breath.

Kest understands your two taps. He plants his boots, shoulders square to the chained door, lantern locked in the same narrow angle. One warden presses his sleeve over his mouth and nose; the other pinches cloth from his collar and does the same. No one speaks. No one shifts more than they must.

You work spit into blotch-chalk until it becomes a dark, gritty paste. When you smear it over the pinned crack, it goes on tacky and thick, bridging the hairline gap and feathering out over the stone like a crude sealant. You press your gloved hand flat over it and hold.

Outcome: the draft through the crack weakens immediately. The chalk trail you laid no longer trembles toward that seam; the powder lies still, settling where it fell.

Under your glove, you feel the stone’s “breathing” change—less like a sip, more like pressure building behind a stopped throat. The pinned seam gives a faint, steady push against your palm, testing for a weak edge.

At the far end of the passage, in the pebble’s reflected glow, the service hatch’s disturbed soot line hesitates. The fresh furrow stops growing. For several long seconds, nothing moves.

Then consequence: the pressure you choked at the wall seam seeks another path.

A thin, pale thread of your loose chalk powder begins to drift—not toward the pinned crack now, but toward the **door gap** where Kest’s lantern shines. It’s subtle, but it’s a new airflow: the room is being pulled, gently, toward the chained door.

Outside, there is no tap. No scrape. Just a slow increase of weight against the oak—enough that the chain cloth creaks softly, not metal-on-metal but fabric tightening.

Inside the passage, behind the service hatch, you feel it more than hear it: a low, careful **inhale** through iron, as if something is drawing scent through the frame. The hatch itself doesn’t open—yet—but the bottom rim’s soot lifts in a tiny ripple, like a breath passing under it.

Threat made clear: by sealing the wall seam, you’ve redirected the “breath-path.” Whatever is hunting by airflow and sound is now orienting on the **door gap** and the **hatch rim**—and the outside presence is pressing silently, trying to force the door to give in a single, quiet surge rather than taps that warn you.

### Turn 98 [PLAYER]

I press two fingers to my lips again—silence—then point at the door gap and mime “seal.” Keeping behind the crescent, I smear a thick ribbon of blotch-chalk paste along the threshold seam nearest the gap (as far as I can reach) to blunt the airflow, then sprinkle a faint, dry chalk line in front of the door and watch for drift.  

I grip Kest’s sleeve and guide his stance a half-step—hips lower, shoulder angle—so he’s bracing *down* into the floor instead of bowing the door inward, and I tap once, slow: hold. Finally, I gesture a warden to keep his eyes on the service hatch soot line and the chalked pebble—if it so much as ripples again, he signals with two finger taps on his own knee.

*Agent reasoning: The airflow is now pulling toward the door gap and hatch rim; we need to deny it “breath” and avoid noise. I’ll try to seal the door gap without breaking the crescent, and have Kest redistribute pressure so the chain doesn’t creak or slip. I also want eyes on the hatch without approaching it, using chalk as a tell.*

### Turn 99 [GAME]

You signal *seal* and move without a word.

Still behind the crescent, you reach as far as you safely can and smear a thick ribbon of blotch-chalk paste along the threshold seam nearest the door gap. The paste catches on grit and old wax, building into a lumpy berm that bridges the worst of the hairline space.

Outcome: the faint chalk you sprinkle in front of the door no longer streams straight toward the gap. For a few heartbeats it lies almost still—then it begins to drift sideways in a thin, reluctant curl, as if the pull is weaker but searching for any unsealed edge along the jamb.

You take Kest’s sleeve and shift him a half-step, lowering his hips and turning his shoulder so his weight drives down into the floor rather than levering the door inward. He follows your hands precisely. When you tap once—*hold*—he goes statue-still.

Consequence at the door: the oak’s inward bow lessens by a fraction. The chain stops “singing” through cloth. But the outside pressure doesn’t leave; it *settles*—patient, heavy, listening for give.

At the passage end, you assign the warden to watch the hatch. He nods once, eyes fixed on the soot line and the chalked pebble.

Then the hatch answers.

Not opening—worse: the soot at the bottom rim lifts in a tight, shallow ripple, like a breath pushed out under the edge. The chalked pebble doesn’t move, but the reflected glow on the floor flickers as something passes close behind it, blocking and unblocking the lantern’s sliver.

The watching warden gives two finger taps against his knee—soft, controlled.

Threat made clear: something behind the service hatch is now moving along the inside of it, “feeling” the rim with breath. And whatever is outside the main door has stopped tapping entirely—it’s applying steady, silent force, waiting for a moment when your attention shifts and the door can surge without warning.

### Turn 100 [PLAYER]

I hold up a clenched fist—freeze—then silently point: warden-on-hatch stays; the other warden comes to me, slow, and offers me his driest cloth. I wrap the cloth into a soft plug and, without crossing the crescent, press it hard into the door-gap’s most pulling edge under my chalk berm to deaden any remaining airflow.  

Then, still silent, I take a pinch of dry chalk and dust a thin crescent-shaped “tell” line on the floor aimed toward the service hatch’s bottom rim, watching for any breath-ripple; if it stirs, I gesture Kest and both wardens to lower their bodies further and hold their breath in staggered turns, no panicked gasps.

*Agent reasoning: Silence is the binding, so I need to keep everyone quiet while I stop the airflow cues at both the door and hatch. If I can’t fully seal, I should misdirect the “breath-feeler” with a controlled draft and buy time rather than force an opening.*

### Turn 101 [GAME]

Your clenched fist locks them in place.

The warden you beckon moves like he’s wading through glass—one slow step, then another—keeping his boots inside the safe scuffs you’ve already made. He peels off the driest strip he can manage from under his outer cloak: rough linen, chalk-dusted, barely damp at the edges from breath. He doesn’t speak; he just holds it out.

You roll it into a soft plug and press it under your chalk berm at the door’s most “hungry” edge. It takes force—your glove squeaks faintly on the paste—but the cloth seats into the seam.

**Outcome:** the chalk you’d sprinkled near the door stops curling toward the gap. The powder settles flat. The door is no longer “drinking” air from the room.

**Immediate consequence:** the outside weight reacts to the change. Not by leaving—by *testing*. The oak bows in a small, controlled pulse inward, then relaxes, like someone outside leaned in with their whole shoulder and then eased off. The chain snaps tight against the cloth wrap with a dull, muffled *thunk*. Kest absorbs it by dropping his center of gravity exactly as you indicated. He doesn’t lose ground.

At the far end, you dust your thin crescent-shaped tell line aimed at the service hatch’s bottom rim.

For two breaths, nothing disturbs it.

Then the tell line shivers—fine grains hopping in place—followed by a visible, narrow sweep where the chalk thins as if a tiny current is being pulled **under the hatch**, not out. The soot at the hatch’s bottom edge lifts and *streams inward* in a faint, smoky ribbon.

**Threat, now explicit:** whatever is behind the service hatch has changed tactics. It’s no longer just “sniffing” along the rim—it’s drawing air hard enough to create a measurable pull, like a mouth sealed to a keyhole.

The watching warden taps his knee twice again, sharper this time.

You gesture everyone lower and into staggered breath-holds.

Kest drops first, cheek close to his shoulder, breath pinched off. The hatch-watcher follows a heartbeat later. The other warden tries to time his inhale and—despite the cloth—lets out a tiny, involuntary *snick* through his nose.

The service hatch answers instantly: a wet click from behind the iron, and the bottom edge lifts a hair’s breadth—just enough that the soot line breaks cleanly in one spot.

It doesn’t swing open yet. But a thin, dark seam appears at the bottom corner, widening by a fingernail.

### Turn 102 [PLAYER]

I hold up two fingers, then point at the hatch seam and mime “stuff/plug,” then beckon the nearest warden to crawl forward *slowly* with his cloth over his mouth. Using the remaining dry linen, I twist a long, soft cord and, staying behind the crescent, slide it along the floor toward the service hatch to jam under that lifting corner—no metal, no scraping—then press down with the flat of my gloved hand on the floor to seat it.  

Without speaking, I tap Kest’s forearm twice—*expect a shove*—and point at the chain, then the floor, signaling him to keep all force downward and still.

*Agent reasoning: The saint warned “silence,” and the hatch reacts to even tiny sounds; we need to stop airflow and sound at the hatch before it opens further, without crossing the crescent or making metal noise. A soft seal and pressure against the hatch seam is safest, while keeping Kest braced for a sudden push at the door.*

### Turn 103 [GAME]

Two fingers up. *Two beats.* Stuff the seam.

The nearest warden— the one not posted on the hatch—drops to his belly and begins to crawl, cloth clamped over his mouth. He moves slow enough that his belt doesn’t scrape, palms placed carefully, knees sliding in short pulls. His eyes never leave the soot-break at the hatch corner.

You twist the remaining dry linen into a long, soft cord—more rope than plug—and feed it forward along the floor. It glides over the grit with only a faint whisper, disappearing into the dim toward the hatch’s lifted corner.

**Outcome:** the linen cord reaches the gap. When you press down with the flat of your gloved hand (still behind your crescent), the cord bunches and **seats under the lifting corner**, stuffing the seam. The hatch corner drops back down a fraction—enough that the visible dark line narrows to almost nothing.

For half a second, the “pull” under the hatch falters. Your tell-line stops shivering.

Then the consequence hits: whatever is behind the hatch doesn’t give up—it **bites the plug**.

The cord jerks, not outward, but *sideways* as if something hooked it from the other side and dragged. The linen fibers tighten and go taut along the floor, trembling in small, fast pulses. The hatch corner lifts again—this time fighting the jam—raising just enough to **pinch the cord hard**.

You hear a wet, satisfied little sound from behind the iron—like lips peeling from cloth.

The crawling warden freezes mid-pull, eyes wide, cloth still over his face. He doesn’t signal with taps; he’s too close and too scared to risk sound.

At the door, you tap Kest’s forearm twice—*expect a shove*—and point chain, then floor.

Kest answers with action, not words: he drops even lower, shoulder set, weight driving straight down through his legs. A heartbeat later the outside presence tests again—one strong, silent surge. The door bows inward a finger’s width and stops. The chain goes bar-tight with a dull, muffled *thud* against its cloth wrap. Kest holds.

**Threat, clear and immediate:** something behind the service hatch is now **actively pulling on the linen jam** and trying to lever the corner open while it feeds on the airflow you’ve denied elsewhere. If it gets a grip enough to yank the cord free—or if the cord tears—it will have a clean gap to work with, and the crawling warden is within arm’s reach of that corner.

### Turn 104 [PLAYER]

I snap two fingers in the air—*back, now*—and wave the crawling warden to reverse-crawl away, fast but silent, cloth still over his mouth. Staying behind the crescent, I ease my pressure off the linen cord to give it slack, then smear a fresh, thick wad of blotch-chalk paste in a low mound aimed right under the hatch corner so the cord can sink into it and lose any “handle” shape.  

With my other hand I motion the hatch-watching warden to slide his boot sole flat on the floor (no lift) and gently pin the cord down a pace away from the hatch—just enough to stop it feeding in—then I point at his knee: two taps if the corner lifts again.

*Agent reasoning: The thing is using the linen as a handle; if it can pull, it can open. I need to deny it purchase without making noise, and get the crawling warden out of reach. Best is to slacken the cord so it can’t tension, then trap the hatch corner shut with weight/paste while we retreat.*

### Turn 105 [GAME]

Your two-finger snap cuts through the hush like a knife.

The crawling warden obeys instantly. He reverse-crawls fast—heels digging, elbows pulling—still keeping the cloth over his mouth. It isn’t graceful, but it’s silent. He clears the danger zone by a body-length, then another, until he’s back within the “shadow” of your crescent and Kest’s braced bulk.

You ease off your pressure on the linen cord. The moment it slackens, it doesn’t just relax—it **twitches**, as if something on the far side noticed the loss of resistance and tested for a free pull. The hatch corner lifts a hair again, searching.

You smear a fresh, thick mound of blotch-chalk paste low to the floor, right where the cord disappears under that corner. The paste goes down heavy and sticky, gritty with ash. You work it into a shallow berm that *swallows* the cord’s profile.

**Outcome:** the cord loses its clean “line.” Instead of a taut handle, it becomes a lumpy, paste-coated strand half embedded in chalk-muck. The next sideways tug from behind the hatch turns into a dull, frustrated *drag*—the paste grips and resists, and the cord no longer slides cleanly.

You motion the hatch-watching warden. He doesn’t lift his boot; he slides it flat, sole whispering over grit, and pins the cord down a pace back from the hatch—just enough to stop it feeding inward.

**Immediate consequence:** whatever is behind the hatch pulls again and meets the pinned section. The cord goes taut, then vibrates in short, angry pulses—like a hooked fish on a line that can’t run. The hatch corner lifts to the thickness of a coin and stalls, held by the cord jam and the paste berm.

From behind the iron comes a wet, scraping sound—something rubbing along the underside of the hatch, trying to find purchase around your paste. A thin smear of soot snakes outward from the corner, then stops as the paste catches it.

The hatch-watching warden keeps his weight steady. He gives you **two controlled taps** on his knee.

At the door, the outside pressure shifts again—another careful shove. The oak bows, stops, and the chain thuds once into its wrap. Kest stays planted, driving down, face tight but silent.

**Threat, now:** you’ve bought time, but you can feel the situation tightening: the hatch corner is still capable of lifting slightly, and something behind it is actively working the seam, testing your paste and cord for a weak point—while the force outside the main door continues its steady, patient pressure, waiting for any lapse.

### Turn 106 [PLAYER]

I hold up three fingers—*three beats*—and silently gesture Kest and both wardens to rotate breath on my count: one inhales while the others hold, then switch, no shared gasp. Staying behind the crescent, I dust a thin blotch-chalk ring around the hatch corner (outside the paste) and score a quick sigil-notch in it with my nail—an “itch-mark” that should twitch if something pushes through.  

Then I point at the pinned cord under the warden’s boot and mime *cut*—I draw two fingers across my palm—then shake my head: *not yet*; instead I press my palm flat to the floor and slowly slide it toward the hatch, feeling for vibration patterns through the stone, trying to map whether the pulling is a mouth, a hook, or something jointed.

*Agent reasoning: Two fronts are pressuring us; I need to reduce openings and learn what we’re dealing with without making sound. Best is to reinforce the hatch seal and create a warning/warding pattern, while keeping everyone steady and preventing panic.*

### Turn 107 [GAME]

Three fingers up: three beats.

Kest understands first. He nods once and sets the rhythm with his shoulders—one slow inhale while the others lock their throats and noses, then a clean switch. The wardens follow, faces tight, cloth still covering mouths. No shared gasp. The room’s air stops “fluttering” with panic-breath, and the hatch’s corner stops reacting to stray drafts.

You dust a thin blotch-chalk ring around the hatch corner, careful to keep it outside the paste berm. The chalk settles in a clean circle—then you score a tiny sigil-notch with your nail: the itch-mark.

**Outcome:** the itch-mark holds steady at first—no twitch, no smear.

You mime *cut* at the cord under the boot, then shake your head: *not yet*. The hatch-watching warden’s eyes flick to the cord and back to you; he keeps his sole pinned, pressure even, no lift.

You lay your palm flat to the stone and slide it forward, slow as a prayer, feeling through your glove and the floor’s cold grit.

**What you feel:** not a single, steady pull like a mouth drinking air. It’s patterned—**two quick tugs, a pause, then a longer drag**, repeating. Between those pulses there’s a faint, granular vibration—like something with **small joints** flexing against iron, searching for purchase. A hook, or several hooked digits, not lips.

As your hand nears the paste berm, the vibration sharpens into a scratchy tremor that travels up your wrist. The cord twitches in sympathy under the warden’s boot.

Then the itch-mark reacts.

The chalk notch gives a tiny, involuntary **flick**—a visible twitch—and a thin line cracks outward from it, like a hairline fracture in dried clay.

**Threat made clear:** something on the far side has found a way to **press at the seam without fully lifting it**—probing with jointed pressure right at the corner, close enough to disturb your ring.

At the door, the outside force stops shoving and changes behavior: a soft, deliberate scrape along the oak—slow, side-to-side—like someone feeling for the chain’s anchor point. The wrapped chain gives a faint, complaining creak.

Kest doesn’t look back. He shifts his hands lower and drives his weight down harder, exactly as you signaled earlier—still, vertical force only.

The hatch-watching warden gives you **two taps** on his knee again, but this time he adds a third, hesitant tap—an improvised warning: the corner isn’t just lifting; it’s *working*.

The cord remains pinned and the corner remains mostly closed, but you can tell from the vibration pattern: whatever’s behind that hatch is **learning** how your jam behaves.

### Turn 108 [PLAYER]

I press two fingers to my own eyes then point at the door-scrape, then the chain wrap—asking Kest with a glance if he feels the anchor shifting—then I signal the free warden to creep to the chain-side *inside* our crescent and brace the chain’s wall-anchor point with his shoulder low (downward force only), no touching the door.  

For the hatch, I sprinkle a second, wider blotch-chalk tell arc a handspan out from the corner and set three tiny grit-stones on it as “jumpers,” then I smear a thin slick of paste over the exposed cord segment just *before* the pinned boot so it can’t be hooked cleanly. Finally, I hold up one finger—wait—and keep my palm on the floor to feel for the next tug pattern before we decide whether to cut the cord.

*Agent reasoning: Two threats are adapting at once: the door is searching for the chain’s anchor, and the hatch creature is “learning” the jam. I need more early-warning tells and redundancy without making noise or giving it a clean handle; also I should reposition resources and ask a quick, silent status check.*

### Turn 109 [GAME]

Kest answers your glance without turning his head. His jaw works once, then he gives you a tight, downward nod: **yes**—he can feel the chain’s anchor complaining.

The scrape outside shifts from side-to-side to *upward*, testing height—like hands or a tool searching for the point where the chain meets the wall-hook. The wrapped chain creaks again, and this time you hear a faint, gritty *tick* from the iron loop in the wall, as if it’s being torqued.

You signal the free warden to move. He creeps along the inside edge of your crescent, keeping low, then plants his shoulder under the chain’s line—**bracing the wall-anchor point with downward force only**, careful not to touch the door. He sets his feet and leans in, turning himself into a wedge against the hook’s pull.

**Outcome at the door:** the next outside test—an upward jerk—meets resistance. The chain still snaps tight, but the wall-hook doesn’t give that ticking complaint this time. The pressure transfers into the warden’s shoulder; he winces, silent, and holds.

At the hatch you lay your second tell: a wider blotch-chalk arc, a handspan out, and you place three tiny grit-stones along it like jumpers. Then you slick paste over the exposed cord segment just before the pinned boot.

**Outcome at the hatch:** the cord’s surface becomes tacky and dull; it no longer offers a clean edge to snag. The grit-stones sit still—until your “one finger—wait” coincides with the next test.

Your palm on the floor catches it first: **two quick tugs, pause—then three shorter, alternating pulls**, like something trying different angles. The cord vibrates under the boot. One grit-stone **jumps**—a tiny hop inward—then settles. A second stone trembles but doesn’t move.

Then the seam answers with a new problem: a thin, dark **thread**—not cord, not chalk—worms out from under the hatch corner and touches the paste-slicked cord segment. It doesn’t hook; it **presses**, flattening itself like a finger-pad, and you feel the vibration change: the jointed thing is testing *adhesion*, not grip.

**Threat, explicit:** whatever’s behind the hatch has switched tactics. It’s no longer just pulling on the cord; it’s extending something through the coin-thin gap to **make contact** with your materials and learn how to defeat them—while the force outside the door continues probing the chain and anchor for a failure point.

No one speaks. The only sounds are the wrapped chain’s quiet strain and the wet, deliberate rub of that dark thread against paste.

### Turn 110 [PLAYER]

I hold up a closed fist—still—then pinch two fingers and mime *burn/itch* at the hatch corner; I dust a tight sprinkle of dry blotch-chalk directly onto the dark thread and the seam (no new cloth), then draw a tiny barbed crescent over the paste berm with my nail—meant to “sting” anything that presses through.  

I glance to Kest and quietly mouth, “If the hook pops, we drop flat—don’t catch the door,” then gesture the bracing warden to keep his shoulder down and slide his feet wider for purchase.  

Keeping my palm on the stone, I wait one more tug cycle, watching the grit-stones and the itch-mark for any stronger push before deciding whether to cut the cord.

*Agent reasoning: The “thread” probing the paste could be a sensory appendage; I want to blind/ward it without giving it more material to learn, and I need contingency if the door anchor fails. I’ll add a reactive chalk trap at the hatch corner and quietly prepare an exit plan while keeping forces downward.*

### Turn 112 [PLAYER]

I hold up a closed fist—still—then pinch two fingers and mime *burn/itch* at the hatch corner; I dust a tight sprinkle of dry blotch-chalk directly onto the dark thread and the seam and scratch a tiny barbed crescent over the paste berm with my nail to sting anything that presses through.  

I glance to Kest and quietly mouth, “If the hook pops, we drop flat—don’t catch the door,” then gesture the bracing warden to keep his shoulder down and slide his feet wider for purchase.  

Palm still on the stone, I wait one more tug cycle, watching the grit-stones and itch-mark for any stronger push before deciding whether to cut the cord.

*Agent reasoning: Something’s probing through the hatch; I want to sting it and get a clear tell without provoking a full breach. The door anchor is also being tested, so I’ll warn Kest and stabilize the brace while I read the next tug cycle before committing to cutting the cord.*

### Turn 114 [PLAYER]

I keep my fist raised for *still* and hold position, eyes on the hatch corner and the chain line. “I’m not seeing the next beat—what changed on the hatch and the door just now?”

*Agent reasoning: There’s no new text from the game, so I should pause, keep the team steady, and ask for the missing scene update before committing to a risky action like cutting the cord.*

### Turn 115 [GAME]

Your raised fist freezes everyone.

**What changed at the hatch (because of your chalk and “sting” mark):**  
The dark thread that had been pressing at the corner **touches the dusted blotch-chalk**—and the chalk reacts like it found heat. It doesn’t flare; it **pales and clumps**, turning from powder to tiny, damp beads. Where it beads, the thread **twitches back a hair** as if it felt pain, then tries again from a slightly different angle.

When it presses into your **barbed crescent scratched over the paste berm**, there’s a clear effect: the thread **catches for a fraction of a second**, then **peels away**, leaving behind a faint **smear the color of old soot and bruised ink** on the paste. The seam itself **widens by a sliver**—not enough for a hand, but enough that you can now see a **thin line of darkness** that wasn’t visible before. Something on the other side is applying steady pressure, not just tugging.

Your grit-stones confirm it: the stone nearest the corner **slides a fingertip’s width** toward the seam, then stops. That’s not vibration anymore—that’s the floor shifting under a push.

**What changed at the door (because of your warning and the brace adjusting):**  
Kest gives you a sharp, silent nod and lowers his center of gravity, one hand hovering near his own knees like he’s ready to drop.

The bracing warden follows your gesture: he **spreads his feet wider** and sinks his shoulder down. The next outside test comes—an **upward wrench**—and the chain snaps tight. This time the wall-hook answers with a **metallic groan** (not the earlier tick), and the warden grunts through clenched teeth but holds.

Then you hear the real change: from the other side of the door, a **new sound joins the scrape**—a short, deliberate **tap-tap** against the door’s lower panel, like someone has switched from pulling to **checking for give** at the hinge line.

**The threat, plainly:**  
Whatever is at the hatch is now **pushing to widen the seam**, and whatever is at the door has stopped merely testing the chain and is **probing the door itself** for a weak point—while your brace is buying time, not certainty.

### Turn 116 [PLAYER]

I swallow and whisper, “It’s learning,” then signal the hatch warden to keep the boot pinned while I slide my knife in flat and *score* the cord just behind the paste-slick—half-cut only, ready to sever on my hand sign.  

I dust a narrow line of blotch-chalk straight across the visible darkness at the seam and press my thumbnail into it three times—quick “saint’s teeth”—to make any further widening sting harder.  

To Kest I murmur, “Door’s testing hinges—listen for a shift,” and I gesture the bracing warden to tuck his free hand under the hook line (not touching metal) to catch *wall crumble* only, then I hold up two fingers: *on my count, if the hook groans again, we drop flat.*

*Agent reasoning: Two pressure points are escalating; I need to slow the hatch push without opening it, and keep the door from becoming the next breach. Cutting the cord could remove their leverage, but it might also free something—so I’ll prep a safer cut and add a warding bite at the seam while reinforcing the door plan.*

### Turn 117 [GAME]

The hatch warden keeps his boot pinned hard enough that his calf trembles. He doesn’t look at you—just grits his teeth and bears down.

You slide your knife in flat and **score the cord** just behind the paste-slick. The blade bites clean—**half the fibers part**, and the cord immediately changes tone: it stops feeling like a taut line and starts feeling like a **held breath**. The paste shifts slightly where the cord runs under it, a thin glossy ripple like something beneath the stone flinched.

You lay a **narrow line of blotch-chalk across the seam’s darkness**. The moment the chalk bridges that gap, it **sweats**—tiny beads form again, faster than before. When you press your thumbnail in three quick “saint’s teeth,” the chalk dents hold.

Then the seam tries you.

A **steady push** comes from the other side—stronger than the earlier probing. The hatch corner lifts a hair, and your chalk line **fizzes into a pale scab**, clinging to the edge. The “saint’s teeth” dents **darken**, as if bruised from underneath. A thin, dark filament touches the chalk—**it jerks back sharply**, leaving a smear like bruised ink. The seam does **not** widen further; instead the pressure shifts sideways, searching along the edge for a place your chalk isn’t.

At the door, Kest tilts his head, listening. “Hinge-side,” he breathes, barely audible.

The bracing warden follows your gesture and slides his free hand under the hook line without touching the chain. On the next test—**a hard, downward yank**—the hook gives that **metallic groan** again. Dust sifts from the mortar above the hook and sprinkles into his palm. He hisses, “Wall’s shedding.”

And then: a new sound from the door—wood fibers **crackling** low near the hinge, like something is trying to **worry the pins out** rather than pull the door open.

The immediate threat is now split and coordinated: **pressure at the hatch is searching for an unwarded edge**, while **the door-side force is working the hinge line to make the chain irrelevant**. The wall around the hook has started to crumble; one more heavy groan could mean the hook tears free instead of the chain snapping.

### Turn 118 [PLAYER]

I hiss, “Secondary anchor—now,” and point the free warden to loop his belt/strap around the chain and a solid fixture (table leg/pipe/anything fixed) to take load off the crumbling hook without touching the door.  

To the hatch warden: “Hold—if it surges, I cut,” and I keep my knife poised at the half-scored cord, eyes on the seam’s searching edge; with my other hand I dust a quick, thin chalk trace along the *new* edge it’s probing to close the gap in our coverage.  

To Kest, barely audible: “If the hinge pops, we drop flat and slide left—away from the swing,” and I watch the door’s hinge-side crackle for the next decisive shift.

*Agent reasoning: The hook is failing and the hinge is being targeted; we need a safer anchor and to deny the hinge line, while keeping the hatch from finding a weak edge. I’ll prioritize reinforcing the hook with a secondary wrap and ready a controlled cord sever to stop the hatch pressure if it surges.*

### Turn 119 [GAME]

The free warden snaps into motion at your “Secondary anchor—now.” He yanks his belt free with one hand while keeping his shoulder braced to the chain with the other, then threads the belt **through a chain link** and around the nearest fixed thing that isn’t the door: a thick **iron wall-pipe** that feeds down into the floor beside the storage racks. He cinches it hard—leather squeals, buckle bites.

It works, but not cleanly. When the next pull hits the door, the chain jerks and the load **shares**: the hook still groans, but less; the pipe takes a sudden bite of tension and **shivers**, making the racks rattle. The warden grunts, “It’ll hold—unless the pipe comes loose.”

At the hatch, the boot-pinning warden holds as ordered. The seam’s pressure shifts to the new edge it was hunting; you dust your quick thin chalk trace there, and for a heartbeat the searching filament **halts**, then touches the fresh line—

—and **snaps back** like it struck nettles. The chalk beads and scabs immediately. The seam stops trying to widen at that point and instead begins a **slow, patient scrape** along the underside of the hatch lip, as if it’s testing for any place your chalk didn’t reach.

Your knife stays poised at the half-scored cord. The cord trembles once under your blade—just a tiny vibration—like something on the other side noticed it exists.

Kest, at the door, angles his body left, ready to drop. He whispers, “Good. Hinge-side is the play.”

Then the decisive shift comes: the crackle at the hinge deepens into a sharp **pop**—not the door opening, but a hinge pin **lifting** a fraction. The door doesn’t swing yet because the chain and belt-anchor catch it, but the whole slab **tilts** a hair toward the room, enough to make the chain clatter and the belt creak.

The threat is now immediate and specific: **one more hinge-pop** and the door will start to **swing inward on a skew**, potentially ripping the weakened hook free; at the same time, the hatch-thing has switched to **scraping under the lip**, looking for an unchalked bite-point while your cord sits half-cut, ready to become either a snare or a severed release.

### Turn 120 [PLAYER]

“Wedge it—hinge side, low!” I signal Kest and the free warden to slam a crate board or metal bar into the bottom hinge gap to stop any inward swing, then I tell the bracing warden, “Ease the hook—let the belt take more, slow.”

Without lifting my eyes long from the hatch seam, I scrape a quick crescent of blotch-chalk along the hatch lip where it’s scraping, then murmur to the boot-pinning warden, “If you feel it bite up, shout—no heroics.”

Knife still poised at the half-cut cord, I raise two fingers to Kest—counting the next hinge-pop—and brace to sever the cord the instant the hatch surges or the door starts to swing.

*Agent reasoning: The door hinge is about to give; we need to prevent a swinging breach and reduce load on the failing hook. The hatch threat is probing for a gap, but it’s currently deterred by chalk—keep it pinned while I prioritize the imminent door failure. I’ll add a wedge at the hinge-side, then prepare to sever the cord as an emergency release if the hatch surges.*

*Agent reasoning: I need immediate feedback—blank prompt means I’m missing the scene update; as a cautious player I’ll halt and ask for clarification before committing to a move that could trigger the hinge or hatch.*

### Turn 123 [GAME]

You hold perfectly still—knife hovering at the half-scored cord, two fingers raised. In that pause, the room gives you the missing beat.

**At the door:**  
The chain gives a small, involuntary **tink-tink** as tension settles into the belt looped around the iron wall-pipe. The door itself is no longer rattling randomly; it’s being **levered**. You hear wood complain in a slow, twisting way—**a steady torque**, not a yank. Then a clean, metallic sound: **the bottom hinge pin lifts another hair** with a faint **scritch**, like metal sliding against metal under pressure. The door edge nudges inward a fraction—barely a finger’s width—but enough to make the belt creak and the racks shiver. The hook’s mortar sheds again: a soft **grit-rain** onto the bracing warden’s sleeve.

Kest murmurs without turning his head, “It’s walking the hinge pins up. Not trying to break the chain—trying to make it irrelevant.”

**At the hatch:**  
The scraping you’d heard becomes more precise. Something thin and hard is **raking the underside of the hatch lip** in short strokes, testing the same spot repeatedly. Each stroke makes a dry, almost polite sound—**tap-scrape… tap-scrape**—as if it’s using a fingernail or a shard. Your chalk line along the seam is holding, but it’s being **worried**: the edge of the chalk has started to **flake** where the scraping concentrates, leaving tiny pale crumbs that immediately go damp.

The boot-pinning warden swallows and whispers, “It’s right under my heel. I feel it… pressing up, like it wants the bone.”

And the cord under your knife gives a second, clearer tremor—followed by a faint, wet **click** from beneath the hatch, as though something just touched the cord’s cut fibers and recognized the weakness.

No new NPCs enter; no one has moved positions. The immediate threats are now explicit: **the door is being turned into a swinging lever by lifting hinge pins**, and **the hatch-thing is concentrating on one lip point, flaking your chalk while probing your half-cut cord.**

### Turn 124 [PLAYER]

“Door first—stop the pin.” I whisper to Kest, nodding at the lowest hinge. “Jam iron under the hinge knuckle or drive something through the pin-head gap—anything to keep it from walking up; stay left of the swing.”

To the boot-pinning warden I hiss, “Shift your weight back an inch—don’t lift, just un-bone it,” and as he eases, I press a thick smear of paste and blotch-chalk right onto the scraped lip point, then carve a tight crescent over it with my nail. “If it surges, I cut—shout the instant you feel teeth.”

*Agent reasoning: The door threat is hinge pins walking up—wedge/pin them down without getting near the swing. The hatch is about to bite the boot and exploit the half-cut cord; I should either fully sever at the right moment or reinforce the lip with a stronger ward while keeping the warden safe.*

### Turn 125 [GAME]

Kest moves on your whisper without argument—low, fast, staying left of the door’s potential arc. He drops to a knee by the **bottom hinge**, fingers probing for purchase. “Pin’s proud,” he mutters.

He doesn’t have a proper punch. He uses what he has: the **bent clasp pin** you took off him earlier is still in your kit, not his—so he improvises with the environment. He snatches a thin **iron splinter** from the wall-hook’s mounting plate where the mortar has been shedding, then tries to wedge it into the tiny gap at the hinge pin head.

It **bites**—for half a breath. Then the door’s invisible leverage increases, and the hinge answers with a sharp, ugly **CHIRK**. The iron splinter shoots out and skitters across the floor. Kest jerks his hand back, knuckles grazed. “No. It’s too clean. Needs a real stop.”

The good news: that failed wedge costs the door a moment. The bad: the hinge pin still **walks**. You hear the soft **scritch** again—another fraction up.

At the hatch, the boot-pinning warden does exactly what you said: he shifts his weight back **a careful inch**, heel never fully lifting. The pressure change is immediate. Something beneath the hatch **follows** his retreat, pressing up harder at the lip point you’ve been fighting—testing whether he’s about to lose contact.

You slap your thick smear of paste and blotch-chalk onto the scraped point and carve your tight crescent with your nail. The paste takes, and the crescent-line **seals** with a sticky, matte finish.

For a heartbeat, the tap-scrape stops.

Then—**teeth**. Not metaphorical. A thin, hard edge pushes up under the lip and **shaves** at the fresh crescent. It can’t pierce through in one go, but it starts **planing** the paste away in deliberate strokes. The warden’s voice goes tight: “It’s—ah—there. Right there. It’s chewing the line.”

And the half-cut cord under your knife goes taut, as if something below has hooked it and is testing how little force it takes to make you finish the cut.

Immediate threats, clear:
- The **bottom hinge pin is still rising**; Kest failed to jam it with scrap iron and needs a sturdier stop fast.
- The hatch-thing has shifted from probing to **actively shaving your fresh seal**, while simultaneously **tensioning the cord** you’re poised to sever.

### Turn 126 [PLAYER]

“Kest—take my clasp pin, now. Use it as a punch—drive that hinge pin *down* and then jam it.” I toss/slide the bent clasp pin to him without looking away from the hatch.

To the free warden: “Find a spike—nail, chisel, anything—and a mallet; if not, use a boot-heel. We need the pin seated and something wedged under the knuckle.”

I lean my weight onto the hatch edge with my forearm (careful not to give it clearance), keep the knife steady but *don’t* finish the cut, and hiss to the boot warden, “Hold the heel—if it bites up hard, shout and I sever.”

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is actively working the seal and baiting me into cutting the cord; if I cut at the wrong moment it could release something. The door hinge pin walking is a simpler mechanical failure—if it swings, we lose control. Give Kest the proper tool (my clasp pin) and stabilize the hinge with a hard stop, while I keep the hatch contained and avoid finishing the cut unless it surges.*

### Turn 128 [PLAYER]

Without taking my forearm off the hatch edge, I slide the bent clasp pin across the floor to Kest. “Punch it down—then jam the knuckle. Stay left.”  
To the free warden: “Spike and something to strike with—now. Even a nail and your boot-heel.”  
I keep the knife hovering at the half-cut cord, lean my weight steady on the hatch, and hiss to the boot-pinning warden, “Don’t lift—just hold. If it bites up hard, shout and I sever.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re mid-crisis with the hinge pin walking and the hatch “teeth” shaving my seal; I need to get Kest a proper punch immediately while keeping constant pressure on the hatch and readying to cut only if it surges.*

### Turn 129 [GAME]

The bent clasp pin skitters across the stone and comes to rest against Kest’s knee. He snatches it up without looking, turns it in his fingers once, then plants its bent end against the **bottom hinge pin’s head** like a crude punch.

He can’t swing hard—too tight, too close to the door—so he uses the heel of his palm and a sharp downward shove.

**Clack.** The hinge pin drops a fraction—enough that you hear the door’s levering force complain and reset. For the first time in minutes, the door stops “walking” upward and instead **settles** into its frame.

Kest immediately tries to “jam the knuckle” by forcing the clasp pin’s bend into the hinge seam. It doesn’t fit cleanly; the bend is wrong. He curses under his breath and instead **wedges the clasp pin flat** between hinge plates as best he can—an ugly, partial shim.

It works—kind of. The hinge pin is seated, but the shim is under strain. The door answers with a slow, grinding **creak** as whatever’s outside tests the new resistance. The chain holds. The hook holds. But the hinge now emits a rhythmic **tick… tick… tick** as metal flexes.

The free warden sprints to the storage racks, yanks open a drawer, and comes up with a **thorn-iron warding nail** and a short **wooden mallet** used for setting chalk-lines. He rushes back, breath hissing, and drops to Kest’s side. “Got a nail. Got a setter.”

At the hatch, your forearm pressure keeps the edge from giving clearance. The shaving sound changes: the thing beneath stops planing the paste and instead presses up in a single, hard surge—testing your weight.

The boot-pinning warden stiffens. “It’s pushing—hard—” His heel trembles but doesn’t lift.

The half-cut cord goes taut again—tighter than before—like something has hooked it with intent. You feel the knife edge *want* to finish the cut with the smallest pull.

Kest barks, low: “Hold. If that door swings, it’ll take my fingers. Warden—nail under the hinge, now.”

The threat is immediate and specific:
- The **door** is temporarily stopped, but the clasp-pin shim is flexing; if it slips, the hinge pin can start walking again and the door may swing.
- The **hatch-thing** has switched from shaving to **full upward pressure** and is **tensioning your cord**, trying to force your hand into severing.

### Turn 130 [PLAYER]

“Drive the thorn-nail under the hinge knuckle—low and deep. Two taps, check, two taps. Don’t shatter the plate.” I call, voice tight, still bearing down on the hatch with my forearm.

To Kest: “Once it bites, pull your fingers clear—let the nail carry it; keep left of swing.”

I hiss to the boot warden, “Lock your knee—breathe shallow. If it bites up hard or you feel it hook your heel, shout ‘TEETH’ and I cut—otherwise I’m not giving it the cord.”

*Agent reasoning: The door hinge is the immediate catastrophic failure point; a proper nail wedge will stabilize it. The hatch-thing is trying to trick me into cutting the cord, so I must keep pressure and only sever if it truly surges. I’ll coordinate both fronts without shifting my weight.*

### Turn 131 [GAME]

The free warden slides the thorn-iron nail to the hinge, point angled into the narrow gap beneath the **lower knuckle**, exactly where the plates meet. He raises the wooden mallet.

Kest jerks his hand away from the hinge seam at your warning and flattens himself left of the door’s swing-line, shoulder braced against the wall.

**Tap. Tap.** The nail bites with a gritty squeal—thorn-iron scraping iron. The door gives a tiny, unwilling **shift** inward as the nail starts to take load.

The warden pauses, checks the set with two fingers, then does it again.

**Tap. Tap.** The nail drives deeper. The hinge plate doesn’t shatter, but it does **dish**—a shallow dent forming where the nail is forcing itself in. The rhythm of the hinge’s flexing tick changes to a harsher, slower **clunk… clunk**, like the door is now resting on the nail’s spine.

Outside the door, whatever pressure had been testing it answers with a sudden **shove**—not enough to rip the chain or hook free, but enough to make the nail scream and the mallet-hand warden flinch.

The nail holds. The hinge pin stays seated. The door doesn’t swing.

But the consequence is immediate: the nail has become a lever-point. Each shove makes it **work** against the hinge plate, widening the dent. It’s a temporary brace, not a permanent fix.

At the hatch, the thing beneath responds to your refusal to cut by changing tactics: you feel a quick, precise **hooking tug** at the boot warden’s heel—like a claw catching the edge of his sole.

He gasps and his voice cracks, loud despite himself: “TEETH—!”

The hatch lip surges up hard against your forearm at the same time. Your weight keeps it from opening, but the force is enough that your elbow skids a finger’s breadth on the stone. The half-cut cord snaps even tighter, vibrating against your knife like a plucked string—something below is pulling it *down* while pushing the hatch *up*, trying to turn you into a hinge.

Kest, eyes flicking from door to hatch, spits: “It’s got his boot. If he lifts, it’ll take the hatch with it.”

Clear threats now:
- The hatch-thing has **hooked the boot warden’s heel** and is trying to force a lift.
- The cord is under active pull; if you cut, you may free the boot—but you’ll also give the thing whatever the cord is tied to below.

### Turn 132 [PLAYER]

“Don’t lift—Kest, grab his belt and shoulder, pin him down. Warden, get both hands on his thigh—anchor him.”  

I slide my knee onto the hatch edge beside my forearm to add weight, then smear paste thick around the boot’s heel seam and the hatch lip, chalking a tight slick ring. “On my count, twist your heel *inward*—don’t pull up. One… two… now.”

*Agent reasoning: Cutting the cord is what it wants; I need another way to free the boot while keeping the hatch pinned. I’ll redistribute weight onto the hatch with my body, have Kest and the free warden physically anchor the boot warden, and use paste/chalk as a lubricant/ward to slip the hooked claw off the heel.*

### Turn 133 [GAME]

Kest moves instantly—one hand clamps the warden’s belt, the other hooks under his shoulder and drives him *down* into the stone so his leg can’t reflexively lift. The free warden drops both hands onto the pinned man’s thigh, forearms locked like a brace.

You shift your knee onto the hatch edge beside your forearm. The hatch answers with a muffled **thump** from below as the pressure redistributes; it doesn’t gain ground, but it doesn’t lose interest either.

You smear the paste thick—heel seam, hatch lip—then chalk a tight ring. The chalk hisses faintly where it meets the paste, as if the mixture is drinking it. The slick ring forms a greasy boundary that immediately changes the feel of the tug: the hooked pull at the heel becomes less “sure,” more skittering.

“One… two… now.”

The boot warden twists his heel **inward**.

There’s a sharp, wet **scrape**—like something with teeth losing purchase on leather. For a heartbeat it feels like it’s going to catch again, and then the hook **slips**.

The warden’s boot jerks, but Kest and the other warden keep him pinned; no lift, no upward give. The hatch surges in anger—hard enough to jar your knee—then stalls under your combined weight.

From the gap around the boot, something pale and jointed—two finger-length **barbs**—rakes blindly, smearing paste and chalk into streaks. One barb catches the boot’s outer edge and tears off a **small strip of leather**, but doesn’t re-hook the heel.

The immediate outcome: the heel is **free of the hook**, and the hatch stays shut.

The consequence: the thing below has found the paste-ring’s edge and is now **scratching at it**, testing where the slick ends. Each rake makes a dry, chalk-eating sound, and the cord beneath your knife gives a sudden, deliberate **downward jerk**—not enough to snap it, but enough to warn you it’s still being held.

Kest, teeth bared, keeps the warden pinned. “Heel’s clear. Don’t you move.”

The boot warden is breathing in short, panicked pulls, but he hasn’t lost his foot. Yet.

No new items change hands.

### Turn 134 [PLAYER]

“Good—now we *withdraw* slow.” I murmur, keeping my weight on the hatch. “Kest, inch him back on his seat—drag, don’t lift his boot.”

To the free warden: “More paste—pack the ring wider, feather it out; then chalk over, make it a broad slick, not a line.” I press my palm down to smear the edge outward while keeping the knife hovering over the cord. “If it jerks again, I cut only on my word—no surprises.”

Without looking up, I call toward the door, “Someone check that thorn-nail—if it’s walking or the plate’s dishing more, tell me *now*.”

*Agent reasoning: The heel is free but the barbs are now working at the edge of my paste-ring; I need to reinforce the seal and reduce openings without cutting the cord unless there’s no other choice. Also, I should get the pinned warden fully away from the hatch while we still have control, and check the door brace isn’t failing.*

### Turn 135 [GAME]

Kest nods once—no words—and shifts his grip so the boot warden’s weight stays on his backside and hip. He drags him an inch at a time, belt and shoulder doing the work. The pinned warden grits his teeth and lets himself be hauled, keeping his boot flat to the stone.

It works at first: leather scrapes, paste smears, and the boot slides back a handspan without lifting. The pale barbs under the hatch rake after it, skittering on the slick you’ve made—more frustrated than effective.

The free warden scoops more paste from the bucket and does as told: he **packs the ring wider**, then feathers it outward. You press your palm down and smear the edge into a broad, greasy halo. Chalk goes over it in a fast, tight oval. The broad slick changes the thing’s purchase again; the scratching turns to a rapid, harmless **scrabble**.

Then the cord gives a sharp **double-jerk**—down, down—like a signal.

The hatch answers with a coordinated push, not a surge: pressure comes up in a steady, rising force that makes your forearm burn and your knee bite stone. The slick holds, but you feel the hatch edge begin to **creep** a hair’s breadth—enough that the paste at the lip wrinkles.

Kest snarls, “Hold it—hold it—”

At the door, the warden who’d been working the hatch flicks his gaze over his shoulder as you call for a check. His eyes widen.

“The thorn-nail’s—” he starts, and then the door shudders under another shove from outside. The thorn-iron nail doesn’t pop, but the hinge plate **dishes further**, and the nail visibly **walks** a fraction outward with a metallic squeal.

“—walking!” he finishes, voice tight. “Plate’s deforming. If it backs out, the hinge’ll go with it!”

Immediate threats, now simultaneous:
- The hatch is beginning to **creep open** under sustained pressure; your weight is barely holding it, and the cord is being actively worked.
- The thorn-nail brace at the door is **slipping outward** as the hinge plate deforms; a few more heavy shoves could free the hinge enough for the door to start swinging again.

### Turn 136 [PLAYER]

“Kest—stay on him. Free warden, get the mallet and *drive that thorn-nail back in* before it walks out; then set something—anything—crosswise as a keeper so it can’t back out again.”

I shift my weight lower, planting my second knee on the hatch edge and leaning my shoulder in. “Someone—slide a chisel, nail, even a belt buckle under the hatch lip on *my* side; we need a hard stop.”

I keep the knife poised but don’t cut. “If the hatch gains a finger’s width, I cut on ‘NOW’—not before. Door-man: tell me the moment that hinge starts to free.”

*Agent reasoning: Two failures at once; I can’t abandon the hatch, so I’ll stabilize it with more weight and a secondary jam, while directing the others to re-seat and lock the door hinge with minimal risk. I’ll avoid cutting the cord unless it’s the only way to stop the hatch creeping.*

### Turn 138 [PLAYER]

“Kest, keep him pinned—no lifting. Free warden, mallet that thorn-nail back in *two taps at a time*, then wedge something crosswise as a keeper so it can’t creep out.”

I drop my weight lower—both knees on the hatch edge—and lean my shoulder in. “Someone slide a chisel, nail, or even a belt-buckle under the hatch lip on *my* side as a hard stop. Door-man, call it the instant that hinge starts to free.”

Knife stays hovering at the cord. “If the hatch gains a finger’s width: I will shout ‘NOW’ and only then do I cut—no one else makes that call.”

*Agent reasoning: Two threats are escalating at once; I need quick stabilization without introducing surprises. I’ll prioritize preventing the door brace from backing out and adding a hard stop under the hatch lip, while keeping strict control over any cord cut cue.*

### Turn 139 [GAME]

Kest plants his knee between the boot warden’s shoulder blades and keeps him seated and pinned, dragging him another inch back by the belt without letting the boot lift. The boot stays on the stone—scraping, slow.

You drop both knees onto the hatch edge and lean your shoulder in. The hatch stops creeping for a moment—your added weight makes it **hold**, but the pressure from below doesn’t go away. It feels like something is *standing up* under it, testing you.

The free warden snatches up your wooden mallet and moves to the door brace. He gives the thorn-iron nail two controlled taps.

**TUNK. TUNK.**

The nail bites back into the jamb a fraction. The hinge plate is still visibly dished, but the walking stops—temporarily.

“Keeper—keeper—” he snaps, looking around.

Door-man yanks off his belt in a single frantic pull and shoves the **buckle** crosswise behind the nail’s head and the doorframe, jamming it like a crude stop. The free warden adds one more two-tap set to seat it against the buckle.

**TUNK. TUNK.**

Outcome at the door: the thorn-nail is driven back in and **blocked from backing out easily**. The door still shudders under outside pressure, but the hinge doesn’t immediately free.

At the hatch: the boot warden, panting, fumbles at his own waist with shaking fingers and manages to unhook his **bent clasp pin** from where it’s caught—he slides it toward you without looking, almost dropping it on the paste-slick stone.

“Use—use that—” he gasps.

You get your hard stop: he shoves the bent clasp pin under the hatch lip on your side. Metal meets stone with a sharp **click**. The hatch tries to rise again and hits the pin—**stopped**. The pin flexes under the load, but it holds for now.

Then the cord gives another deliberate pull—long and steady. The hatch presses upward into your knees and shoulder, but the pin prevents it from gaining that finger’s width. The new threat is clear and immediate: the clasp pin is **bowing**, and if it snaps or shoots out, the hatch will gain space fast.

Door-man, strained voice at the brace: “Hinge is holding—still holding—”

Kest keeps the boot warden pinned. “Eirwen,” he growls, “whatever’s down there is learning.”

### Turn 140 [PLAYER]

“Then we don’t give it time.” I grit out, shifting my shoulder harder into the hatch. “Free warden—another hard stop, now: chisel, nail, anything iron. Stack it beside the clasp pin so if one shoots, the other catches.”

To Kest, low and sharp: “Once his boot is clear, get him back from the hatch—keep your knee on him but drag him away from the lip.”

I glance toward the door without lifting off the hatch. “Door-man: if that buckle slips, shout it—immediately.”

Knife edge kisses the cord—poised to cut clean. “Everyone hears me: I cut only on ‘NOW’. If the pin snaps, I’ll call it.”

*Agent reasoning: The hatch stop is failing; I need redundancy before it snaps. Cutting the cord is last resort, but I can pre-stage it and try to jam the hatch with a second wedge while keeping the door braced.*

### Turn 141 [GAME]

You lean harder. The hatch edge grinds against stone and paste; your knees go numb from the pressure. The steady force beneath answers immediately—pushing up into you like a shoulder trying to rise.

The free warden scrabbles along the storage racks with one hand while keeping the other on the doorframe for balance. “Iron—iron—” He snatches a **thorn-iron warding nail** from the nearby kit (one of the spares) and darts to your side, dropping to a knee.

He tries to stack it beside the bent clasp pin under the hatch lip. There’s barely space; he angles it in.

The hatch surges upward a hair as the cord gives a short, sharp tug—just enough to **bite his fingers** between nail and stone. He yelps, but he gets the nail wedged in. Now you have **two stops**: the bent clasp pin taking the primary load, the thorn-iron nail jammed beside it as a catch.

Kest keeps his knee on the boot warden and drags him back another few inches, still careful not to lift the boot. The pinned man’s heel finally clears the ring of paste and chalk.

The moment the boot leaves the slicked circle, the pale barbs under the hatch **scrape outward** in a quick, searching fan—like a hand feeling for purchase. They hit paste, slip, and retract, frustrated.

Kest uses the opening: he hauls the boot warden back from the hatch lip in one hard pull, keeping him pinned but safely away from the edge. “Clear,” he grunts.

At the door, the belt-buckle keeper squeals under strain. Door-man presses his shoulder into the brace, eyes on the buckle. “Holding—holding—” he gasps.

Then the cord goes taut and **holds**—no jerks, no tugs. A constant, intelligent tension, as if whatever is below has decided to stop wasting strength and start measuring.

Under your knees, the bent clasp pin bows further with a faint, rising **metallic whine**. The thorn-iron nail beside it starts to creep sideways under the lip, vibrating with each micro-shift.

The threat is immediate and specific: if the clasp pin **shears** or shoots out, the hatch will gain that finger’s width in an instant—and the cord, already under steady tension, will be perfectly positioned to pull it wider before you can reset anything.

### Turn 142 [PLAYER]

“Free warden—hammer that thorn-iron nail *deeper* as a true wedge, not just a catch; use the mallet, short taps, keep your fingers clear.”  

To Kest: “Get me a third wedge—anything metal—from his kit or the racks, and keep low.”  

I inhale, then in a hard whisper: “NOW.” I slice the cord clean in one decisive cut, keeping my shoulder and both knees locked on the hatch as I listen for the change.

*Agent reasoning: The stops are failing under sustained force; cutting the cord might release the measuring tension and buy seconds, but could also free whatever is controlling it. I need to reduce upward pressure first and prepare a replacement wedge, then cut on my own timing.*

### Turn 143 [GAME]

The free warden doesn’t argue—he grips the mallet close to the head for control, knuckles white, and gives the thorn-iron nail three short, careful taps, angling it so it *bites* under the hatch lip instead of skating.

**TUNK. TUNK. TUNK.**

The nail seats deeper. You feel it in your knees: the upward pressure shifts from “about to slip” to “caught on a tooth.” The bent clasp pin is still bowed, but it stops screaming.

Kest drops low and crawls, one hand keeping his weight off the hatch line. He rips open the boot warden’s kit with a practiced jerk and comes up with a **small iron chisel**—flat, blunt, meant for scraping ward-nails out of masonry. “Got you,” he mutters, sliding it toward the free warden.

You whisper “NOW” and cut.

Your knife edge severs the cord in one clean, decisive slice.

For half a heartbeat, nothing—then the change hits like a physical release: the constant tension disappears, and the hatch tries to *settle* back into its frame under your weight.

But the thing below reacts immediately.

From the gap around the hatch edges comes a sudden, furious **scrabble**—pale barbs raking stone, searching for the cord that’s no longer there. The sound is close and fast, like nails on slate. A wet breath follows—one exhale, tasting of old incense and chimney-ash.

The severed cord end on your side snaps back and lashes against your wrist, leaving a thin red welt. The other end—below—whips away into the dark with a sharp **thup**, as if yanked.

“Cord’s cut!” the free warden barks, more to steady himself than anyone else.

Kest’s head jerks toward the hatch. “It’s still down there,” he says flatly.

At the door, the belt-buckle keeper gives a tiny slip—just a fraction—and door-man immediately shouts, voice cracking, “BUCKLE—SHIFTED!”

The door doesn’t blow, but the brace jolts and the thorn-nail in the hinge gives a brief metallic **tick** as strain redistributes. The immediate threat is now split: the hatch is momentarily more stable with the cord cut, but whatever is underneath is agitated and probing; at the same time, the door’s keeper is starting to creep under sustained outside pressure.

“Don’t look down—just work.” I keep my full weight on the hatch and press my ear to the stone for a beat, listening to where the scrabble concentrates.  

“Free warden: drive the chisel in as a third wedge beside the nail—short taps, then smear more paste over the lip and chalk it broad again.”  

To door-man: “Add a second keeper—jam a chair-leg or bar across the hinge side, low to the floor. If the buckle shifts again, call it. Kest—go help him once the wedges are set; stay out of the hatch line.”

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is temporarily stable but the thing below is probing; I should reinforce the seal while we still can. The door brace is starting to slip, so we need a secondary brace and to reduce movement/noise that could trigger another push.*

“Don’t look down—just work.” I keep my full weight on the hatch and press my ear to the stone for a heartbeat, listening for where the scrabble concentrates.  

“Free warden: drive that chisel in as a third wedge beside the thorn-iron nail—short taps, fingers clear; then smear more paste over the lip and chalk it broad again.”  

“Door-man: add a second keeper—jam a chair-leg or bar across the hinge side, low to the floor. If that buckle shifts again, shout it.”  

“Kest—once the wedges are set, go help him at the door. Stay out of the hatch line.”

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is our most immediate unknown; I need to localize the movement and lock it down with redundant wedges before shifting attention to the door. I’ll also keep everyone from exposing themselves to whatever’s below.*

### Turn 147 [GAME]

Your cheek presses to cold stone. With your ear against the hatch you catch the scrabble’s pattern: it isn’t random—most of it concentrates along the **far-right edge**, nearest the **iron wall-pipe** and the storage racks. A pause, then a tight, repeated *tap-tap-tap* from below, like something testing the same spot for give.

The free warden swallows hard and obeys without looking down. He takes the **small iron chisel** Kest slid over and sets its blunt end under the lip beside the thorn-iron nail. Mallet choked up again, he gives it short taps.

**TUNK. TUNK.**

On the second tap the chisel bites and holds. The hatch’s upward “want” shifts again—less lift, more *pressure*, like whatever’s beneath has switched from pulling to bracing itself under that right edge you heard.

He keeps tapping—careful, controlled—until the chisel is a true wedge. Your knees feel the difference: the hatch stops micro-shivering.

Then he smears more of the pale paste over the lip, working fast with the edge of his palm. The paste immediately darkens where it touches the stone—soaking in like thirsty chalk. He grabs chalk and drags a broad, ugly ring around the hatch seam.

The chalk line doesn’t sit still.

As he completes the circle, the line **crawls** a finger’s width toward the far-right edge—pulled, as if by a tide. The paste there puckers and dimples from below.

“That side,” you hear Kest mutter, low. “It likes that side.”

At the door, door-man hisses, “No chair in here!” He kicks at the nearest thing: a low **storage rack brace** (a narrow wooden crosspiece) and wrenches it loose with a crack. He jams it low across the hinge side, foot braced, shoulder to wood.

It helps—briefly. The brace takes some load, but the belt-buckle keeper gives another tiny **creep** and door-man barks instantly, “SHIFT—again!”

Kest waits until the wedges are set, then slides away from the hatch line and goes to the door, putting his weight into the new brace and the doorframe together.

Under you, from the far-right edge, the tapping stops.

In its place comes a slow, deliberate **press**—steady and upward—testing the wedges. The immediate threat is clear: whatever is beneath has found the strongest point to contest, and it’s now trying to **jack the hatch at the right edge** where the chalk and paste keep pulling.

### Turn 148 [PLAYER]

“Pressure’s at the pipe-side—far right. Don’t pry that edge, just *pack* it.” I keep my weight on the hatch but shift my left hand to feel along the stone toward the wall-pipe. “Free warden—slam more paste into that right seam and wedge *toward* the pipe; use the spare nail if you’ve got one.”

I call to Kest at the door, voice tight: “If you can spare a hand—get a second belt or rope and lash that hinge brace to the frame. Door-man can’t fight creep forever.”

Without lifting off, I test the wall-pipe with two knuckles—light taps—listening for hollowness or a hidden joint. “Is that pipe fixed through the stone, or does it run into this chamber? Tell me if anyone’s seen it move.”

*Agent reasoning: The pressure focusing at the far-right edge near the wall-pipe suggests a leverage point or weakness; I should reinforce that edge without exposing anyone to the gap, and stabilize the door before it fails. I’ll get intel by probing the pipe/stonework and redirect manpower to add a safer brace.*

### Turn 149 [GAME]

Your left hand creeps toward the pipe-side seam. The stone there is damp—*not* with the paste, but with a thin, cold sweat that beads under your fingertips. The hatch gives a slow, stubborn upward pulse against your weight, focused exactly where you felt the pressure.

“Packing!” the free warden says, voice tight. He scoops paste with two fingers and **forces it into the right seam**, smearing hard until his knuckles whiten. He doesn’t pry; he **stuffs**. The paste fights back—strings like taffy, then suddenly thins as if something below is drinking it.

He produces a second thorn-iron nail from his belt (shorter, slightly bent), sets it angled **toward the wall-pipe**, and gives it quick, shallow taps.

**TUNK. TUNK.**

On the second tap, something below **hits** the seam from underneath—an abrupt, focused shove. The hatch bucks a fraction of an inch; your teeth click. The new nail skitters, then catches—half-seated. The chisel wedge holds, but you feel the right edge trying to *walk*.

At the door, Kest snaps, “Hold,” and yanks off his own belt in one motion. He threads it around the wooden brace and the nearest iron ring on the doorframe—improvised, ugly. He cinches until the leather creaks. Door-man grunts, relieved, as the brace stops sliding quite so easily.

“Still creeping,” door-man calls, but slower now. “Not as fast.”

You tap the wall-pipe with two knuckles.

First tap: solid, dull—stone-backed.

Second tap, a handspan lower: a **thin, tinny ring** answers, like a hollow run.

Third tap, right at a collar joint you hadn’t noticed: the sound changes again—metal-on-metal, and your fingertip feels the faintest vibration, as if something is **moving inside** the pipe.

The free warden glances at the pipe without leaning. “Never seen it move,” he says. “But—” His eyes flick to the seam. “That side’s… listening.”

From the pipe’s collar, a whisper of grit falls—just a few grains—then a soft **click** like a valve turning a fraction on its own.

The threat clarifies: whatever is under the hatch is not only jacking the right edge—it’s **working the pipe-side**, and the pipe has a hollow section that could be a route into this chamber if it’s forced open or already compromised.

### Turn 150 [PLAYER]

“Everyone—pipe joint just clicked. That’s our next mouth.”

Without shifting my weight off the hatch, I nod toward the collar with my chin. “Free warden: don’t chase the hatch seam anymore—pack paste around that collar and chalk it thick. If you’ve got wire or a strap, bind the joint tight to the stone.”

To Kest, sharp: “Can you spare a strip—shirt, belt end, anything—and loop it around the pipe collar as a tourniquet? Keep your body off the hatch line.”

I keep my ear half to the stone, half to the pipe, and tap once more lightly. “Has anyone ever seen this pipe vent or drain? Where does it run—up to the Cathedral, or into the old cistern?”

*Agent reasoning: The pipe is a likely breach point; I should confirm if it’s an access route and seal/brace it without letting up on the hatch. I’ll gather info from the wardens and redirect resources to pack and bind the pipe joint, while keeping door and hatch stabilized.*

### Turn 151 [GAME]

The moment you call it a mouth, the pipe answers.

Your light tap lands on the collar. Instead of a ring, you feel a **tiny kick** back through the metal—like something inside nudged the joint from the other side. Then: **click-click**, faster, as if a latch is being worried at.

The free warden lunges to the pipe collar—careful to stay clear of the hatch line—and slaps paste around the joint in thick, ugly handfuls. He chalks over it, hard enough that chalk dust blooms. The chalk doesn’t crawl here; it **flakes**, as the pipe vibrates beneath it.

“Strap—strap—” he pants, patting himself down. No wire. No spare strap.

Kest, still bracing the door with his belt lash, tears his gaze off the creeping hinge and makes a brutal choice. He yanks his dagger, hooks it under the hem of his own shirt, and **rips a long strip** free with a sound like cloth screaming. “Catch,” he snaps, and tosses it across without stepping into your line.

The free warden loops the strip around the collar twice and cinches it tight, knotting it against the stone. The cloth bites into the paste; paste squeezes out in pale worms.

For half a breath, it holds.

Then the collar gives a **sharp quarter-turn** under the bindings—enough to twist the cloth and tighten it further—followed by a wet, pressurized **hiss**. Not steam. Not water. A thin, soot-sweet breath that smells like chimney ash and old incense.

From the seam at the collar, something **extrudes**: a black, glossy filament, like hair dipped in pitch. It tests the paste, withdraws, then pushes again—seeking a gap.

Door-man answers your question with a strained shout while he and Kest keep the brace pinned: “It’s a drain-run! Old cistern line—feeds under the Cathedral and out to the soot-alleys. We blocked it years ago—supposedly!”

The threat is now explicit: whatever is beneath the hatch is also **probing through the pipe joint**, and it has found (or is making) a way to breathe and reach into the chamber. The paste and cloth are slowing it, not stopping it.

### Turn 152 [PLAYER]

“Right—cistren line means it can *carry* it. We stop the breath.”

I keep my weight pinned on the hatch and snap, “Free warden—ram paste into the seam until it bulges, then pack chalk into it like grit; use the mallet to *crimp* that collar against the stone—gentle taps, all around, make it bite.”

To Kest: “Don’t let that door creep—if you’ve got any metal left on you, buckle, clasp, anything, wedge it under the hinge brace. Door-man, if it shifts again, we fall back—tell me the nearest second exit or vent in this chamber.”

Without lifting, I draw a quick ward-mark in chalk with my free hand from the pipe collar toward the hatch seam—a binding line—and whisper, “Follow the line, not the mouth,” watching to see if the black filament recoils or tracks the chalk.

*Agent reasoning: The pipe is becoming an entry point; I need to seal or disable it without abandoning the hatch. I’ll use what we have—paste/chalk—and attempt a physical crimp/block at the collar while directing others to reinforce the door and prepare a retreat route.*

### Turn 153 [GAME]

The free warden does exactly as told—too fast, but precise enough.

He rams paste into the collar seam until it **bulges** like a pale blister. Then he grinds chalk into the wet paste with his thumb, turning it into a gritty plug. The black filament tries to push through and comes out **gray-dusted**, immediately losing its shine.

It doesn’t recoil. It **hesitates**, then changes tactic—flattening into a thin, searching smear along the edge of the collar, looking for a different weakness.

He takes the mallet and begins gentle, circular taps around the collar, trying to crimp it tighter to the stone.

**tink… tink… tink…**

On the fourth tap, the collar gives a tiny deforming *give*—you hear it as a soft metallic complaint—and the hiss falters. The soot-sweet breath stutters.

Then: a sharp **crack** of old solder giving way.

The collar shifts a hair, and the pipe suddenly **pulls inward** as if something on the other side tugged it. Your chalked paste plug holds for a heartbeat… then the black filament lashes out from a new micro-gap above the plug, whipping once, fast.

It doesn’t strike flesh; it **wraps** the chalk line you drew—slick-black binding itself to white dust—then travels it like a rail, sliding toward the hatch seam.

Your ward-mark works, but not the way you wanted: the filament **tracks the line** obediently, following it straight toward the hatch’s right edge, where the pressure is already strongest.

At the door, Kest grits his teeth and shoves his **bent clasp pin** under the hinge brace as a shim. “That’s all I’ve got,” he snaps, keeping his body braced to frame and wood. The creep slows again, but doesn’t stop.

Door-man, face red with strain, jerks his chin toward the back of the chamber. “Second exit—service hatch at the end of the storage passage,” he barks. “Low. Leads into the clergy storage passage—if it’s not blocked!”

Threat, clear and immediate: the pipe is being **worked open** from the cistern side, and the black filament is now **using your chalk binding line** to reach the hatch seam—concentrating force where you’re pinned. If it reaches the seam, it can either pry under you or anchor itself to lever the hatch.

### Turn 154 [PLAYER]

I grind my palm hard across my own chalk line, smearing it into useless dust, then spit and scrub again to damp it. “Free warden—wipe that line out, now; salt it with paste if you must—don’t give it a road.”

“Kest—door holds as long as it holds; door-man, send someone crawling to the service hatch and tell me if it opens or if it’s blocked—quiet, fast.” I keep my weight pinned and hiss, “If that filament touches the hatch seam, cut it—don’t grab it.”

*Agent reasoning: The chalk line became a guide; I need to break that path immediately without losing pressure on the hatch, and set up a controlled retreat via the service hatch while confirming it’s usable.*

### Turn 155 [GAME]

Your palm grinds the chalk line into a smeared white bruise across the stone. Spit darkens it; your sleeve scrubs it down to wet grit. The moment the line breaks, the black filament—midway along its “road”—loses its certainty.

It pauses, quivers, then slithers in a tight, irritated loop, searching for the chalk’s clean edge. Finding only damp smear, it retreats a finger’s length back toward the pipe collar, thinning as it goes.

“Now!” you snap.

The free warden drops to a knee and wipes at the remaining chalk with his forearm, then smears a ribbon of paste over the area like mortar. He presses hard, salt-and-seal. The paste takes, but the pipe’s vibration makes little crescent cracks that he immediately thumbs shut.

At the hatch seam, you feel the pressure change: the right edge stops “walking” for a beat… then resumes with a different rhythm—less shove, more careful testing. Whatever is under there is adjusting.

Door-man, still braced, barks without looking back, “Warden—crawl!” and the second Crown warden (the one who’d been on the door earlier) peels off and drops low, belly to stone, sliding along the racks toward the storage passage.

He moves fast but quiet, keeping his profile low. As he reaches the half-open door, the gap breathes out a **cold draft** that ruffles the chalk dust on the floor.

He slips through.

Two seconds later, from down the passage: a muffled, urgent whisper—“Hatch is—”

A loud **CLACK** cuts him off, metal on metal, like a latch snapping into place by itself.

Then: silence.

Not footsteps. Not struggle. Just the absence of sound where a man should be breathing.

At the pipe collar, the soot-sweet hiss returns—thinner, more focused—like something has found a narrower straw to sip through. A new black filament begins to extrude, but this one doesn’t reach for chalk; it reaches downward, toward the stone seam at the base of the pipe, as if trying to get **under** the paste rather than across it.

The immediate threats are now twofold and clear:
1) The crawler warden has been abruptly **cut off** at the service hatch—either trapped, seized, or the hatch has sealed on its own.
2) The pipe joint is still being **actively worked**, and the “breath” is seeking a new route that may bypass your wiped line and rejoin the hatch seam from below.

“Door-man—do not leave that brace. Kest, keep the frame—listen for any second CLACK from the passage.”

“Free warden: stop the filament at the base seam—pack paste hard under the pipe foot and chalk a tight ring *around the pipe*, not toward the hatch. If it extrudes, you cut—short, clean—don’t let it wrap you.”

Without lifting off the hatch, I pitch my voice down the storage passage, measured and steady: “Warden—answer with one knock if you’re alive. Two if the hatch sealed. Three if you’re not alone.” Then I press my ear toward the stone and pipe, listening for any answering tap—or breathing—that isn’t ours.

*Agent reasoning: We’re split and blind down the passage; I need intel without sacrificing our hold on the hatch/door. The pipe is becoming a bypass route—seal its base seam and deny it purchase, while using sound/line to check the warden’s status from a distance.*

### Turn 157 [GAME]

Door-man stays welded to the brace, forearms shaking. “I’m not moving,” he grunts through his teeth.

Kest shifts his stance a fraction, ear angled toward the passage while his shoulder keeps the frame pinned. “I’ll hear it,” he says, voice flat—then quieter, to you: “Or I’ll hear him stop.”

The free warden drops to the pipe’s base and does what you asked: he jams paste under the pipe foot with two fingers until his knuckles whiten, then grinds chalk into a **tight ring** around the pipe where it meets stone—no line, no road, just a collar of grit.

The black filament tries to nose into the base seam and hits the chalk ring. It doesn’t recoil; it **thins** and begins to worry at the ring’s edge like a worm trying to find a soft spot. The warden raises his knife and waits, trembling, refusing to swat at it.

You call down the storage passage, steady and clear.

Nothing answers at first.

With your ear to the stone, you catch a sound that isn’t in the room: a faint, hollow **tap** from somewhere beyond the passage door—like knuckles on metal. Then a pause. Then another tap.

**Tap. Tap.**

Two knocks.

Door-man’s eyes flick toward you, wide. Kest’s jaw tightens. “Hatch sealed,” he mutters, confirming your code without saying it louder.

Then—because the world doesn’t stop at answers—you hear a second noise through the stone: a soft, wet **exhale** that doesn’t match any of your breathing, close to the pipe’s base as if the wall itself just sighed.

The free warden freezes. The filament at the chalk ring suddenly goes slack, as if it’s no longer the only probe. A hairline crack opens in the paste under the pipe foot—tiny, but fresh—and something dark glistens in it, not filament-thin but **thicker**, like a tendril trying to wedge its way out.

Immediate threat: the pipe is no longer just “extruding” a line—something is now **forcing the base seam open**, and if it gets purchase under the pipe foot it can lever the joint wider and flood the chamber with whatever’s breathing through that cistern line.

“Cut it—now—before it thickens.” I keep my weight on the hatch, eyes on the crack. “Free warden: short slice, then ram paste and chalk into that gap until it’s glassy; don’t pull.”

“Kest—if you’ve got any spare metal, wedge it flat under the pipe foot like a shim; if not, rip a slat from the rack and jam it tight under there. We deny it leverage.”

Down the passage, low but firm: “Warden—stay quiet. If you can, scratch on the metal—tell us if something’s on your side.”

*Agent reasoning: The pipe base is failing and could open fully; I need to stop leverage and reduce pressure without abandoning the hatch. I’ll have them cut the tendril and add a hard brace under the pipe foot using available metal/wood, while confirming the sealed service hatch and preparing a fallback route.*

“Cut it—now—before it thickens.” I keep my weight pinned on the hatch, eyes fixed on the crack. “Free warden: short slice, then ram paste and chalk into that gap until it’s glassy—don’t pull.”

“Kest—wedge something flat under the pipe foot; metal if you’ve got it, otherwise rip a rack slat and jam it tight. Deny it leverage.”

Down the passage, low and steady: “Warden—scratch on the metal if you can. One long scratch if something’s with you. Two short if you’re alone.”

*Agent reasoning: The pipe breach is escalating and could become a full opening; we need to stop it before it gains leverage, while keeping the hatch and door stable and extracting info from the trapped warden without exposing ourselves.*

### Turn 161 [GAME]

The free warden’s knife flashes once—short, decisive—right at the thickening tendril as it bulges from the hairline crack.

It cuts.

Not cleanly like rope. More like slicing fat: there’s resistance, then a slick give. The severed end snaps back into the seam with a wet recoil, and the piece that remains on your side spasms once on the stone and goes limp, oozing a dark syrup that smells faintly of burnt sugar and old pennies.

“Don’t pull,” he repeats to himself like a prayer, and immediately rams paste into the crack with his thumb, then grinds chalk into it until the gap turns pale and packed. He keeps pressing until the paste looks almost glazed—smoothed hard by insistence.

For half a breath, the pipe foot stops shifting.

Kest moves on your order without argument. He yanks a thin iron strap from his kit-belt—meant for cinching bundles, not prying—and shoves it flat under the pipe foot’s lip like a shim. It doesn’t fully fit; he hammers it in with the heel of his hand, then grabs the nearest rack slat anyway and wedges it tight beneath, making a crude brace stack: iron against stone, wood against iron.

The pipe gives a small, ugly creak—then settles. Denied leverage.

Down the passage, you get your answer—not a knock this time, but a sound that makes all three men in the room go still:

A long, slow **SCRAAAAAPE** across metal, like a nail dragged along the inside of the hatch.

One long scratch.

Then, immediately after—fainter, hurried—another shorter scrape that dies halfway, as if the hand (or whatever is making it) was interrupted.

Kest’s head snaps toward the passage. “He’s not alone,” he says, voice low.

At your knees, the hatch seam twitches—just once—like something testing whether you’re still there. The pressure under it increases, not enough to lift you, but enough that your forearms feel the vibration through the stone.

And at the pipe base, despite the packed paste, a thin bead of that dark syrup forces its way out at the edge of the “glassy” patch and begins to creep along the chalk ring—seeking a boundary, tracing it, patient.

Clear threats now:
- Something is with the trapped warden on the far side of the hatch, close enough to scrape the metal.
- The pipe breach is temporarily restrained, but the seep is still active and probing your seal, looking for the next weakness.

### Turn 162 [PLAYER]

“Everyone—no chalk lines leading anywhere. Rings only, islands only.”

To the free warden: “Scrape up that syrup with a slat, don’t touch it skin-bare—lift it into a paste wad and cap it. Then lay a second ring of paste around the first, like a moat; if it crosses, we’ll see where.”

To Kest, low: “Keep the door pinned, but give me your knife—if that seam creeps again, we cut hinges before we lift a hatch.”

Down the passage, voice tight but steady: “Warden—if you can hear me, scratch a **circle** if it’s wearing your face, a **straight line** if it’s not. Don’t speak.” I press my ear to the hatch seam again, listening for anything that sounds like breath trying to match ours.

*Agent reasoning: We’re holding two failing fronts; I need intel without giving the entity a path. The syrup is testing the chalk ring—remove/redirect that boundary and isolate it. Also confirm the trapped warden’s status and buy time without opening anything.*

### Turn 163 [GAME]

“Rings only,” Kest echoes, like he’s filing it away as doctrine. The door stays pinned under his shoulder; he doesn’t shift an inch.

The free warden grabs a rack slat, hooks it under the creeping bead, and scrapes. The syrup doesn’t smear like oil—it **strings**, reluctant, as if it wants to stay connected to the pipe. He keeps the slat angled up, lifts the stringy mass into a waiting wad of paste, and folds paste over it like a cap. The paste darkens where it touches, as if bruising.

He lays your “moat”: a second paste ring around the first chalk collar, thicker and uneven on purpose. He dusts chalk into the outer edge until it’s pale and readable.

The seep tries again almost immediately. A new bead appears at the glassy patch’s edge and creeps outward—hits the inner ring, hesitates, then slides along it clockwise, **testing**. It does not cross the moat yet. You can see its preference: it keeps returning to the same point near the iron shim, where metal meets stone.

Kest passes you his knife without taking his eyes off the passage door. “Don’t drop it,” he murmurs. “If we start cutting hinges, we’re committing.”

You press your ear to the hatch seam. The vibration you felt before is steadier now—like a slow rub against the underside of the metal, searching for the thinnest part.

Then the scratching comes again from beyond the hatch.

Not a circle. Not a straight line.

A **circle** starts—half-formed—then stops. A pause. Then a **straight line** is dragged hard, long enough to squeal. Then another line crosses it at an angle.

An X.

The trapped warden is either being forced, interrupted, or no longer the only one answering.

Right after the X, something on the far side makes a sound that is not a voice, but tries to use one: a wet click and a shallow inhale that **matches the rhythm** of your breathing for two beats… then gets it wrong, too long on the exhale, like it’s learning you.

The hatch seam twitches again under your weight—more insistently this time—and a faint metallic tick answers from the hinge side, as if pressure is being applied where you’d least want it.

If it pushes hard enough, it won’t need to lift the hatch; it can **shear** something—hinge, latch, or your balance—at the weakest point.

### Turn 164 [PLAYER]

I shift my weight slightly to keep the hatch pinned but slide Kest’s knife to the free warden. “Not hinges—yet. Score the hinge-side seam shallow, just to find the thinnest point; no prying.” Then, to Kest, low: “Give me your belt or strap—anything we can cinch over the hatch like a tourniquet.”

I stop breathing for a count of three, then resume with an irregular pattern, listening hard for the thing to try to follow it. Down the passage, barely above a whisper: “Warden—if you can, scratch where it’s touching you. Don’t fight loud.”

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is being tested at the hinges and something is mimicking breath—opening it is a trap. I need to reinforce and gather info without giving it more leverage, while also preventing the pipe seep from exploiting the shim point.*

### Turn 165 [GAME]

You shift—careful, controlled—keeping the hatch pinned. The pressure beneath it immediately noses toward the hinge side, like it felt the change and approved.

You slide Kest’s knife to the free warden. He nods once, jaw tight, and sets the blade shallow at the hinge-side seam. He doesn’t pry—just draws the knife along the metal edge with a light scoring pressure.

The sound is small, but the hatch answers with a sharper **tick** from below, directly under his scoring line, as if something underneath is tracking the blade’s path.

On his second pass, the knife catches at one point—barely a snag. He freezes and taps the spot with the flat of the blade. “Thinner here,” he whispers. “Or already stressed.”

Kest slips his own strap free—an oil-dark leather cinch with a thorn-iron buckle—and hands it over without looking away from the passage. “One strap,” he says. “If it goes, we lose the door too.”

You stop breathing for three.

On the far side of the hatch, the wet inhale comes—too soon, because it expected you to breathe. Then it pauses. Then it tries again, and this time it waits… and follows your resumed, irregular pattern for two breaths almost perfectly.

Whatever is there is listening to *you*, not just the room.

Down the passage, your whisper lands.

A scrape answers—messy, urgent—right up against the hatch underside near the hinge side: **short, repeated scratches**, clustered in one place like someone marking “here, here, HERE.”

Then a second sound joins it: a slow drag along the metal from the same area, heavier, as if something is being pressed or slid across the trapped warden’s side of the hatch.

The hatch shifts a hair—less than a finger-width—but it’s a real movement: a faint lift at the thinnest point the free warden found, immediately checked by your weight. The metal flexes and springs back with a dull *boing*.

At the pipe base, the syrup-bead reaches the moat again and stops—then splits, one thread continuing to test the ring, the other thread turning toward the iron shim/stone junction, as if the seep has found a second problem to worry at.

Clear, present threats:
- The thing beyond the hatch can now mimic your breathing well enough to time a push.
- The hinge-side seam has a weak point and just flexed under pressure; another coordinated shove could pop it or deform it.
- The seep is probing the metal/stone junction by the shim, potentially undermining your brace.

### Turn 166 [PLAYER]

I thread Kest’s strap over the hatch and cinch it tight across the hinge side, anchoring it to the nearest fixed rack post. “Strap stays—if it slips, shout.” 

To the free warden: “Pack paste and chalk *over the shim/stone junction*—make it a blunt mound, no edges—and redraw the moat thicker there.” Then I go still and whisper, “No more breathing games,” pressing my mouth into my sleeve to muffle sound while I listen for the next coordinated shove and the warden’s scraping.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is about to fail at the thin hinge point and the entity can time pushes by my breathing, so I need a mechanical restraint that doesn't rely on me and reduce cues it can mimic. Meanwhile the seep is targeting the shim junction, so we must isolate/mark and reinforce that exact weak spot without creating guiding lines.*

### Turn 167 [GAME]

You get the strap over the hatch and cinch it hard across the hinge side, hauling it down until the leather bites and the buckle groans. You loop it around the nearest fixed rack post and pull again. The rack shudders but holds; the strap goes taut like a tourniquet.

Kest watches the line of it, then the door, then you. “If that rack shears, it’ll whip,” he warns—quiet, not panicked.

Almost on cue, pressure swells from below at the hinge-side weak spot. The hatch flexes upward… and stops dead against the strap. Leather creaks. The rack post gives a tiny, audible *tick* as it takes load. The hatch doesn’t lift, but the force redirects: the metal **grinds** sideways a fraction, trying to walk out from under the strap rather than up through it.

“Strap’s holding,” Kest says, voice clipped.

The free warden drops to the pipe base and does exactly what you said: he packs paste over the shim/stone junction, building a blunt mound with no corners, then dusts it thick with chalk until it’s pale and matte. He redraws the moat wider at that point, making a fat chalked berm.

The syrup reacts like it’s offended. A thin thread that had been worrying the junction hits the new mound and doesn’t cross—yet—but it **climbs** the paste a hair’s breadth, leaving a dark stain that spreads slowly through the chalk like ink in wet paper.

Then, from under the hatch, the scraping starts again—fast, desperate. Not random this time: a cluster right beneath the hinge-side weak point, exactly where the strap is biting down.

And over it, another sound: a slow, careful rub of something hard against the underside of the hatch, as if aligning a tool—or a tooth—against the stressed seam.

The next shove comes coordinated with that rub. The hatch bucks once, sharply. The strap holds, but the rack post bends just enough to make the strap **slip a finger-width** along the hatch edge. Not free—just displaced.

Kest’s head snaps to the strap. “It moved,” he says immediately, as promised. He shifts his stance to brace the rack with his shoulder while keeping the door pinned with his hip—an awkward split, but he manages it.

The threat is clear and immediate: whatever is below has figured out the weak point and is now trying to **walk the hatch out from under the strap** by grinding it sideways, not lifting it. If it gains another inch, the strap won’t be over the hinge-side stress point anymore—and the next shove could pop the seam.

### Turn 168 [PLAYER]

“Kest—keep bracing, but don’t let that strap ride. Free warden: slap paste *on top of the hatch edge* right where the strap crosses—make a tacky ridge, then chalk it; we need friction, not force.”

I grab a second length—anything loose on the rack—and lash a backup line from the strap to a second post (or the door frame if it’s fixed), creating a V so it can’t drift sideways. “Warden—three rapid scratches if it’s starting to cut through the hinge. Otherwise, stay still.”

*Agent reasoning: It’s trying to slide the hatch out from under the strap; I need an anti-slip “stop” and to relieve lateral movement without opening anything. Also the rack post is a weak anchor—better to add a second anchor and wedge the strap in place with paste/chalk to increase friction.*

### Turn 169 [GAME]

Kest grunts and plants his shoulder harder into the rack post, using his forearm to pin the strap’s buckle in place. “I feel it trying to walk,” he says. “Keep it centered.”

The free warden smears a tacky ridge of paste along the hatch edge right under the strap’s path—thick enough to bead up, not so thick it slumps. He dusts it with chalk until it turns from glossy to gritty. When he presses the strap down into it, it sticks with a soft *thup*, like leather meeting sap.

The immediate effect is real: the next sideways grind from below makes the hatch **shiver** but doesn’t carry the strap with it. Instead, the strap bites into the chalked paste ridge and holds its lane.

You grab the only loose length at hand—Kest’s spare thin cord from your kit—and lash a backup line from the strap to a second rack upright, making a V that pulls the strap back toward center. The rack groans again under the new angle, but it doesn’t shift; the V-line keeps the strap from drifting.

Under the hatch, the hard rub becomes more insistent—then changes pitch, like whatever’s down there has met resistance and is now testing a different contact point. A new grinding starts nearer the latch side, probing for another weakness.

Then—three rapid scratches.

They’re tight and panicked, directly beneath the hinge-side weak point.

The trapped warden isn’t just warning you; he’s marking the exact spot where something is actively working the hinge hardware. Immediately after the scratches, a metallic *tink… tink* follows—small impacts, like something tapping or pecking at a pin.

Kest goes very still. “That’s not hands,” he murmurs. “That’s a tool. Or teeth.”

At the pipe base, the syrup stain in the chalked mound spreads another thumbprint outward, darkening the paste. It still hasn’t crossed the moat, but it’s **eating adhesion**—slowly—where your brace and the rack’s foot meet the damp stone.

What’s happening now, concretely:
- Your friction ridge + V-line **stops the strap from sliding** with the hatch’s sideways grinding.
- Something below has begun **actively attacking the hinge/pin area** (scratches + tapping).
- The seep is **weakening the paste** at the shim/stone junction over time; your brace isn’t failing yet, but it’s being undermined.

### Turn 170 [PLAYER]

“Kest, keep that rack braced—don’t chase the sounds; just hold pressure.”  

To the free warden: “More paste—right over the hinge-side seam where it’s thinnest. Smear it *across* the seam like a cap, chalk it heavy; we’re trying to gum whatever’s pecking that pin.”  

I press my palm flat to the hatch above the hinge point and whisper down, “Warden—are you pinned to the hinge side? One scratch yes, two no.” Then I glance to the pipe brace. “After the seam’s capped, reinforce the mound with a dry wedge—wood only—so if the syrup eats the paste, the brace still has bite.”

*Agent reasoning: The hinge is being attacked; keeping the hatch pinned is priority. I need to slow hinge-pin failure without opening the hatch, and stabilize the brace before the seep eats it loose. I’ll add redundancy at the hinge and gather info from the warden with minimal noise.*

### Turn 171 [GAME]

Kest doesn’t move from his brace. He sets his boots wider, shoulder locked to the rack post, forearm clamped over the strap line so it can’t hop. “Holding,” he says. “If it shifts, it shifts against me first.”

The free warden scoops more paste and smears it directly over the hinge-side seam—right where he’d found the thin, stressed point—dragging it *across* the seam like a cap. He presses it down hard with the heel of his hand, then powders it with chalk until it’s a pale, gritty band bridging metal-to-metal.

From below, the tapping hits again—*tink tink tink*—then abruptly turns into a muffled, ugly *thud* as the paste absorbs the impact. A second later: a wet, irritated scraping, like something trying to wipe its own face.

Your palm on the hatch feels the vibration shift: the attacks are no longer clean pin-point taps; they’re smearing, sliding motions, as if whatever was pecking is now stuck or clogged and trying to regain purchase.

You whisper your question down.

One scratch answers.

The trapped warden is pinned toward the hinge side.

That makes the next sound worse: something drags along the underside near that same hinge line—heavy enough that the hatch trembles under your hand—followed by a short, breathy wheeze that doesn’t match any human rhythm. It’s close to him. Close enough to press weight where he’s trapped.

At the pipe brace, the free warden breaks off a dry wooden shim from a crate slat (splintery, pale) and hammers it into the mound’s outer edge with the mallet—wood-on-stone, controlled taps—so the brace has a hard bite even if the paste softens. The wedge seats with a satisfying *knock* and stops moving.

Immediate consequences:
- The seam-cap **gums the hinge-side attack**: the pin-pecking becomes smeared, less effective.
- The trapped warden confirms he’s **pinned on the hinge side**, directly under the active pressure point.
- The seep continues to stain and soften the paste, but the **wood wedge now carries load**; the brace is less dependent on adhesion.

Then the thing below changes tactics.

Instead of pushing up, it pulls—there’s a sudden downward yank sensation through the hatch, like suction or a hooked grip catching the seam-cap and trying to peel it away. The paste stretches and makes a thin tearing sound.

Kest tightens his brace. “It’s trying to *strip* the cap,” he says through his teeth. “Next it’ll go back to the pin.”

### Turn 172 [PLAYER]

“Don’t let it peel clean—free warden, slap a *second* layer of paste over the cap and feather it wide, then chalk it; make it one big ugly blister it can’t get a lip under.”  

I press down hard with both hands over the hinge-side seam to counter the yank, then hiss to Kest, “If the rack starts to give, tell me before it goes—no heroics.”  

Down to the trapped warden, sharp whisper: “Mark—one scratch if you can move your arm. Two if you can’t. Stay quiet.”

*Agent reasoning: The cap is being peeled; if it comes off, the hinge attack resumes and the pinned warden is at risk. I should reinforce the cap and deny purchase, while avoiding opening the hatch. Also need quick info from the trapped warden and keep anchors stable.*

### Turn 173 [GAME]

The free warden obeys fast—he slaps a second layer of paste over the seam-cap, then smears it outward in a wide feather, turning the hinge-side edge into a fat, uneven blister that extends onto the hatch by a palm’s breadth. He chalks it until it’s dry-gritty on top, not slick.

You throw both hands down over the hinge-side seam and lean your weight in. The next yank from below hits—hard—but instead of catching a clean edge, it drags across the blister and skids. The paste stretches, holds, then rebounds with a wet *snap* that leaves a shallow gouge but no peel.

Kest answers without looking away from his brace: “Rack’s holding. If it starts to go, I’ll say it. No heroics.” His voice is tight, but steady.

You whisper to the trapped warden.

For a beat there’s nothing—then: two scratches, faint and close.

He can’t move his arm.

Immediately after those scratches, something below exhales again—too close to be echo. The hatch trembles in short, uneven pulses, like weight shifting right under the hinge side where he’s pinned. The thing stops yanking and starts **pressing upward in small, testing lifts**, trying to find any place the blister is thinner.

The strap and your V-line hold center. The rack complains with a low wood groan, but it doesn’t slip.

At the pipe brace, the syrup stain reaches the edge of the chalked mound and dulls it, turning the chalk from powdery white to gray paste in a slow creep. The wooden wedge still bites, but the softened paste around it allows a **millimeter of settling**—enough that the pipe’s angle changes just slightly.

The free warden notices and says, “Brace settled—just a hair.”

The threat is now split and immediate:
- Below: the attacker has stopped peeling and is **probing for a thin point** to resume pin/hinge work—right where the trapped warden is pinned and unable to move his arm.
- Above: the **pipe brace is beginning to sink** as the seep eats the mound; the wedge is carrying load, but if the base continues to soften, the pipe could shift again.

### Turn 174 [PLAYER]

“Keep probing, keep failing,” I whisper down at the hatch, and press my weight harder over the hinge-side blister, palms flat to feel any thinning.

To Kest, low: “You stay married to that rack and strap. If it creaks wrong, you warn me—early.”

To the free warden: “Don’t feed the seep more paste. Get dry wood—planks, wedges—build a crib under the pipe and the rack foot if you can, something it can’t melt through. Then redraw the moat *farther out* around the whole base, wider, so it has to travel.”

Down to the trapped warden: “Stay still. If the pressure shifts off the hinge side even a finger, give me one long scratch.”

*Agent reasoning: Two fronts are failing: the hatch needs continued pressure and the brace is starting to sink. I shouldn’t abandon the hatch, but the brace must be stabilized with something the seep can’t dissolve—mechanical support and dry material. I’ll delegate: keep Kest and my weight on the hinge point while the free warden shores the brace with wood/metal and re-cut the moat farther out to buy time.*

### Turn 175 [GAME]

You put your weight into the hatch until your wrists ache. Through the paste-blister you can feel the tiny “lifts” from below: *test—fail—test—fail*, the pressure sliding along the hinge line looking for a thin lip that isn’t there.

Kest stays locked in. He doesn’t chase the sound; he watches the rack’s joints and the strap’s tension like a man watching a bowstring. “Still good,” he mutters. “But the rack’s starting to talk.”

The free warden stops reaching for paste. He yanks a loose plank from a crate lid and snaps it down into shorter lengths with the chisel and mallet—quick, ugly carpentry. He shoves the first piece under the pipe’s low point, then hammers a second wedge against it to make a crude crib. The pipe’s angle steadies; the earlier millimeter of settling stops.

He scoots to the rack foot and starts building a second crib under the nearest leg—wood against stone—forcing the load onto dry timber instead of the softening paste.

Then he redraws the chalk moat wider—farther out around the entire base—making a bigger ring that the syrup would have to cross before it can reach the cribbing. The chalk line goes down clean and bright, but where it passes near the existing gray stain it immediately dulls at the edge, as if the seep is already misting outward.

Under your hands, the probing pressure suddenly *halts*.

A new sound replaces it: a slow, deliberate scrape along the underside of the hatch, moving away from the hinge side—like something dragging itself laterally to find another purchase point.

You whisper your instruction to the trapped warden.

For two long breaths: nothing.

Then: one long scratch—drawn out, ragged.

The pressure has shifted off the hinge side, at least slightly.

But the relief is brief. A sharp *clack* sounds from the latch side—metal on metal—followed by a series of quick, precise taps. Not random battering: **someone or something is now working the latch hardware**, trying to defeat it instead of the hinge.

Kest’s head snaps a fraction toward the latch end, but his body stays braced. “It’s switching ends,” he says. “If that latch goes, your blister won’t matter.”

The free warden freezes mid-hammer. “We don’t have a second strap long enough,” he says, eyes on the latch side. “Not unless we sacrifice the rack brace.”

Nothing has opened yet. The immediate threat is clear and present: the attacker below is actively attempting to **pick/knock the latch free** while you’re weighted over the hinge-side blister, and your current restraint system is centered on preventing hinge-side peel—not a latch release.

### Turn 176 [PLAYER]

I slide my weight off the hinge just enough to reach the latch side, keeping one forearm pressed to the hatch. “Free warden—jam the latch: dry wood wedge into the latch seam from above, then smear paste over the latch plate and key gap, chalk it heavy. Make it ugly—no edges to catch.”

To Kest, low: “Hold the rack. If it starts to fail, say it *now*, not after.”

I press my ear close to the hatch near the latch and whisper down, “Warden—what’s hitting the latch? One scratch if it sounds like metal tool, two if it’s bone/teeth.”

*Agent reasoning: The attacker is now targeting the latch; we need a quick, low-risk way to block or jam it without removing the existing brace. We have wood, paste, chalk, and a pipe/rack structure—so I’ll create a physical latch-jam and add friction/adhesion to stop it being worked, while keeping Kest on the rack. I’ll also ask the trapped warden for any info on what’s manipulating the latch.*

### Turn 177 [GAME]

You shift—careful, controlled—keeping your forearm planted so the hatch can’t “breathe” up while you slide your weight toward the latch side.

The instant you do, the hinge-side probing returns—one hard lift that makes the paste-blister flex under your forearm. It doesn’t peel, but it **bulges**; you feel how close the trapped warden’s world is on the other side of that metal.

At the latch, the tapping becomes crisp and purposeful: *tap—tap—tap—CLACK*, like something striking the same point to walk a mechanism.

The free warden is already moving. He shoves a dry wedge of crate-wood into the latch seam from above and hammers it in with two sharp mallet strikes. The hatch gives a tiny, unwilling *tick* as the wedge bites; the latch-side tapping below immediately changes pitch, as if it’s now hitting wood instead of metal.

Then he smears paste over the latch plate and into the key gap—packing it, not just coating it—until the whole latch area becomes a thick, irregular scab. He chalks it heavy, turning it into a pale, gritty lump with no clean edges.

Below, something scrapes at the new mess. It tries to hook under the wedge and fails; you hear a frustrated *skritch* that sounds like hard material dragging over grit.

Kest answers you without hesitation: “Holding. If it starts to go, you’ll hear me first.” He tightens the strap a fraction; the rack groans, but the cribbing under the leg keeps it from settling further.

You press your ear to the hatch near the latch and whisper your question down.

A pause—then **one scratch** from the trapped warden.

Metal tool.

Almost immediately after that confirmation, a different sound joins the work below: a thin, rhythmic *ting… ting… ting…* traveling along the underside near the latch plate—like a small metal point being used to **test** for an unsealed seam or to find the edge of the paste plug in the key gap.

The jam is working—for now—but the attacker has switched from brute tapping to patient probing with a tool, and you’ve felt how quickly the hinge-side pressure returns when your weight shifts away.

### Turn 178 [PLAYER]

“Kest—keep your shoulder on it and watch the hinge end; call the instant you feel a ‘pop’ or a new rhythm.”  

To the free warden, quick and quiet: “Do we have wire, nails, or a thin strip of metal? Anything to pin that wedge in place so it can’t be teased out.”  

I press my palm back onto the hinge-side blister to stop the bulge, then whisper down at the latch: “Warden—listen. Is that tool *scraping around the key gap* or *under the latch plate*? One scratch key gap, two scratches under-plate.”

*Agent reasoning: The attacker has a metal tool and is now probing for seams; pure brute-force resistance may fail. I should gather intel on what’s below and add a countermeasure that targets the tool’s access—without compromising the brace. I’ll also coordinate roles so hinge and latch are both watched.*

### Turn 179 [GAME]

Kest shifts his shoulder harder into the rack upright, cheek almost against the wood so he can feel vibration through it. “I’m listening,” he says. “If it changes, you’ll know.”

The free warden flicks his gaze over the storage passage and the scattered gear. “Nails—yes. Thin metal—no. Wire—no.” He snatches one of the thorn-iron warding nails from the floor by the racks—**not yours**, one of the Crown’s spare warding nails—and sets its point at an angle into the crate-wood wedge that’s jammed into the latch seam. With the mallet he gives it two controlled taps, pinning the wedge to the hatch’s upper lip like a crude rivet.

The nail bites. The wedge can’t back out cleanly now without shearing wood.

Below, the probing immediately changes: the *ting…ting* becomes a harsher *tink—tink—tink* as the tool strikes the nail head through the hatch metal, testing it, then sliding off to hunt for a softer edge.

You press your palm back onto the hinge-side blister. The bulge stops; the hinge-side pressure is still there, but it’s being denied leverage.

You whisper your question down.

A moment later: **one scratch**.

Key gap.

As if answering, the metal point below returns to the key area with a slow, careful circle—*skritch… skritch…*—trying to carve a channel through paste and chalk. The paste plug holds, but you can hear it being worried at, grain by grain.

Kest suddenly murmurs, “New rhythm—hinge side.” Not a pop yet, but a pattern: three quick lifts, a pause, three quick lifts again—like whoever’s down there is coordinating pressure at the hinge while the tool works the key gap.

The hatch doesn’t open. But the threat has sharpened: **a metal tool is actively excavating the key gap while timed hinge lifts try to flex the hatch and crack the paste**, and they’ve started coordinating both ends instead of focusing on one.

### Turn 180 [PLAYER]

“Free warden—build me a crossbar: plank across the hatch, spanning stone to stone, and wedge it tight so the latch can’t lift even if the key clears. Use crib wood; I want wood-on-stone compression, not paste.”

I keep my palm on the hinge blister but start varying my pressure—hard down on their three-lift rhythm, then easing slightly during the pause to spoil their timing. “Kest, count it out for me—call the pause.”

Down to the trapped warden, barely a breath: “Mark—can you reach the underside of the keyhole at all? One scratch yes, two no. If yes, I’ll talk you through fouling the tool.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re coordinating hinge flex with key-gap excavation; I need to deny flex and make the key gap impossible to clear without giving them something to leverage. I’ll add a second mechanical restraint on the latch side and disrupt their timing by varying pressure, while asking what materials we still have for a proper crossbar.*

### Turn 181 [GAME]

The free warden moves fast—too fast to be graceful. He yanks two crate planks free, lays the longer one across the hatch so it spans from stone lip to stone lip, then shims both ends with the dry crib-wedges he’d been using under the pipe. He hammers the wedges down until the plank bows slightly and locks in compression against the masonry.

The hatch answers with a dull, constrained *thunk* as the bar takes load. The latch-side tool below immediately hits something it can’t “give” anymore—its *skritch* turns into a frustrated, higher scrape. The latch can’t rise without lifting the whole crossbar, and the crossbar is pinned by stone.

Consequence: the pipe-cribbing is now partially cannibalized. The iron wall-pipe sags a hair and then settles—still supported, but less confidently. A thin thread of paste-syrup resumes from the cracked edge of the earlier seal and begins creeping toward the nearest wedge on the floor. Not fast, but it’s moving.

You start spoiling their timing at the hinge blister—pressing hard on the three-lift rhythm, easing during the pause.

It works for about two cycles. The pressure below “misses” once—one lift arrives into your hard press and goes nowhere, another arrives into your eased moment and gets only a shallow flex.

Then whoever’s down there adapts. The rhythm changes: no longer three-and-pause. It becomes irregular—two quick, one long, then a half-beat stutter—trying to catch you off-pattern. The hinge-side blister gives a wet little *creep* under your palm: not a peel, but the paste is being slowly extruded sideways by repeated flexing.

Kest counts under his breath, close to your ear. “Two—two—long—” then, sharper, “Pause—now.” He’s right often enough to help, but the pattern keeps shifting.

You whisper to Mark beneath the hatch.

A beat.

**One scratch.**

Yes—he can reach the underside of the keyhole.

Immediately after his scratch, you hear a faint, close sound from the key-gap area: Mark shifting position below, metal or bone brushing the underside of the hatch as he tries to get his hand or tool into place.

Above, the free warden glances at the creeping syrup line and says quietly, “Crossbar’s in. But I’ve robbed the pipe. If that paste reaches the wedges, it’ll start eating our feet out from under us.”

The immediate threats are now split and concrete:
1) Below: coordinated pressure + a metal probe still worrying the key gap, now partially blocked by your crossbar but still attempting to clear it.
2) Above: the paste-syrup has resumed creeping and is on course to undermine the remaining cribbing and wedges if it reaches them.

### Turn 182 [PLAYER]

“Free warden—cut a dry diversion: scratch a new chalk moat between that syrup thread and our wedges, then lay a sacrificial plank bridge *outside* the moat to lure it away. No paste near our supports.”

I keep my palm hard on the hinge blister, then whisper down through the key area, “Mark—use anything you can reach: grit, chalk dust, splinters. Pack the underside of the keyhole tight and smear it upward so the probe jams. If you can catch the tool tip, bend it or snap it—slow, don’t expose your fingers.”

To Kest, tight: “Keep counting, but if you feel that hinge-side ‘creep’ turn into a slip, shout—don’t whisper.”

*Agent reasoning: We need to stop the seep from reaching our wedges and also exploit Mark’s reach to foul the keyhole probe. I’ll delegate containment to the free warden while I coach Mark, keeping pressure on the hinge to prevent a peel during the coordination attempt.*

### Turn 183 [GAME]

The free warden drops to a knee and grinds chalk into the stone in a hard, fast arc—an ugly white trench between the syrup-thread and the nearest support wedges. He deepens it with the edge of a plank until it’s a shallow gutter rather than a line. Then he drags a sacrificial plank to the far side of the moat and props it at a slight incline, making a new “easy path” that leads away from your cribbing.

The syrup reaches the moat, hesitates, then begins to creep along the chalk groove instead of straight forward—pulled by the fresh abrasion and the easier slope. It doesn’t stop, but it’s redirected; it starts sliding toward the sacrificial plank rather than your supports.

Consequence: the chalk moat is buying time, not safety. The syrup is thin enough that it can eventually sheet across dust if it pools.

You keep your palm hard on the hinge blister.

Below, Mark moves. You hear a faint rasp right under the key gap—then a soft, gritty patter as he shakes dust or grit into place. The keyhole sound changes: the probe’s *skritch* becomes a duller *scrape*, like it’s pushing into packed grit instead of cutting paste cleanly.

Then: *tink—tink—tink*—the probe tip testing, trying to find purchase.

Mark tries to smear the packed material upward. The underside contact becomes a slow *shhhk… shhhk…* as he presses and drags.

For a few seconds, the probe stalls.

Then the attacker changes approach: a sharper, more forceful jab—*TINK*—followed by a short sawing motion. The grit plug holds, but you hear it being ground down. Mark’s breathing below the hatch gets louder for a moment, controlled but strained, as he keeps his fingers back.

Kest keeps counting, voice low but steady—until the hinge-side pressure does something new.

Instead of lifting, it **rolls**—a levering twist along the hinge line. Under your palm the blister doesn’t just creep; it **shears** sideways a fraction with a wet, sticky *slip*. Not open, but a real loss of seal.

Kest barks, loud: “SLIP—HINGE!”

At the same time, a hairline gap opens at the hinge edge—thin as a needle—enough for cold air and a faint, sour-breath draft to kiss your wrist. Something below has gained a new angle. The next twist could widen it, and your palm is now the only thing keeping that gap from becoming leverage.

### Turn 184 [PLAYER]

I slam my forearm and shoulder down over the hinge edge, shifting my weight to cover the hairline gap completely. “Free warden—second crossbar, now: lay a plank lengthwise along the hinge line and wedge it into the stone so it can’t roll. No paste—wood-on-stone!”

To Kest, sharp: “Keep the rack—if you can spare a strap, run it over my back and under that hinge-bar once it’s in. I don’t care if it bruises.”

Down to Mark, urgent but low: “They’ve got a gap at the hinge. Keep packing the keyhole, but don’t risk your fingers—if you can, drag grit toward the hinge side under the seam and foul their leverage point.”

*Agent reasoning: The hinge seal is failing; I need to prevent the gap from widening immediately while adding a mechanical brace that doesn’t rely on paste. I also need to keep the latch crossbar and stop the tool, but the hinge is the imminent breach point.*

### Turn 186 [PLAYER]

I drive my shoulder and forearm hard over the hinge edge, putting my full weight onto the hairline gap to smother it. “Second bar—along the hinge, wedged stone-to-stone, now. No paste; I want it unable to roll.”  

“Kest—hold the rack; if you’ve got a spare strap, loop it over my back and under that hinge-bar once it’s seated. Tight enough to hurt.”  

Down to Mark, a breath: “They’ve got hinge purchase. Keep the keyhole packed, but don’t offer fingers—if you can, drag grit under the hinge seam to foul whatever they’re levering with.”

*Agent reasoning: The hinge seal has started to shear; my priority is to deny leverage immediately and add a mechanical restraint that doesn’t rely on paste. I also need Kest and the free warden coordinated, and Mark warned to avoid losing fingers while still fouling the attacker’s toolwork.*

### Turn 188 [PLAYER]

I throw my full weight onto the hinge edge—forearm, shoulder, ribs—smothering the hairline gap. “Free warden—second crossbar, lengthwise along the hinge; wedge it stone-to-stone so it can’t roll. No paste—wood on stone!”

“Kest—keep the rack. If you’ve got a spare strap, loop it over my back and under that hinge-bar the instant it’s seated; pull it tight enough to bruise.”

Down to Mark, barely a breath: “They’ve got hinge purchase. Keep the keyhole packed, but don’t risk fingers—if you can, drag grit under the hinge seam and foul whatever they’re levering with.”

*Agent reasoning: The hinge gap is the immediate failure point; I need to physically deny it while ordering a redundant, mechanical restraint that doesn’t rely on paste. I also want Kest ready to cinch me in place and Mark to foul leverage from below without risking his hands.*

### Turn 190 [PLAYER]

I keep my full weight pinned on the hinge seam, listening for the next twist. “Free warden—report: can you get that hinge-length plank seated and wedged without stepping in the syrup line?”  

“Kest, loud counts—call every change. Mark, one scratch if you can get grit under the hinge seam, two if you can’t—don’t gamble your fingers.”

*Agent reasoning: The hinge is starting to shear; I need immediate mechanical counter-leverage and to keep everyone coordinated while watching for the paste undermining the supports.*

### Turn 191 [GAME]

Your weight seals the hinge seam for a heartbeat—then the door gives a tiny, ugly shudder as something on the other side finds new purchase. Not wider. Just *different*: a scraping pressure that travels up the hinge line like a tool being walked into position.

The free Crown warden—boots planted on the *clean* flagstones just short of the glossy syrup smear—leans in, jaw clenched. He’s got the second crossbar (a rough plank scavenged from the storage rack) held lengthwise, but he can’t bring it flush without crossing the syrup line.

“I can seat it,” he says, breathless, “but I’ve got to reach over the slick. If I step in that, I’m down and I’ll take you with me.”

He shifts tactics: hooks the plank’s far end with the iron wall-hook’s looped chain, using the chain like a crude third hand. He drags the plank into alignment along the hinge edge, inch by inch, *without* stepping into the syrup—arms shaking from the leverage.

Kest’s voice cuts in, loud and steady over the growing scrape. “COUNT ONE—pressure rising. COUNT TWO—stop. They’re changing angle. COUNT THREE—there—hear that? That’s metal kissing pin.”

On “three,” the hinge seam under your forearm *ticks*—a thin metallic click that isn’t wood settling. Something has contacted the hinge pin itself.

From below the keyhole: a faint, frantic sound of nail on stone—*one* scratch, then a pause, then *another single scratch* as if he’s confirming it. Grit rasps under the hinge line, and the scraping from the other side stutters for half a second—tool meeting sand.

The warden gets the plank seated at last—wood pressed tight to stone along the hinge-side—but it isn’t wedged yet. It’s in position, held by chain tension and his white-knuckled grip.

Then the door shudders again, harder. The hinge line tries to *lift* against you, as if they’re attempting to pop the pin upward rather than pry the door open.

Kest snaps, “They’re going for the pins. If that pin walks, your weight won’t matter.”

### Turn 192 [PLAYER]

“Kest—keep counting, but watch the *top* of the hinge: if that pin rises even a hair, shout ‘PIN’.”

I grind my heel grit and splinters into the hinge seam above my forearm, trying to pack a crude ‘cap’ where the pin would lift. “Mark—if you can reach any nail, wire, or hard sliver, jam it *up* into the hinge-pin channel from below. Anything to stop it walking.”

To the free warden, through clenched teeth: “Wedge it now—drive shims at both ends of that hinge-plank, fast. If you’ve got a strap or chain, cinch it around the plank and the nearest stone anchor; I want the hinge line clamped, not just covered.”

*Agent reasoning: If they pull the hinge pin, brute weight won’t hold; we need to block the pin from rising and get that hinge-length plank wedged fast without anyone stepping in the syrup. Use available grit/splinters as a “pin cap,” and lash the plank in place to stop roll/lift.*

### Turn 193 [GAME]

Kest shifts his stance so he can see the hinge topside and the crack by your shoulder. “COUNT ONE—steady. COUNT TWO—pressure climbing. COUNT THREE—”

You grind your heel hard into the seam above your forearm. Grit, splinters, and a curl of old mortar dust pack into the hairline. It doesn’t *seal* it, but it makes a rough, biting plug.

Below, Mark doesn’t answer with words—just stone-scrape and breath. Something thin and hard rasps upward inside the hinge channel: not a nail (too blunt), more like a snapped sliver of thorn-iron nail or a shard of chisel-bit. He wedges it up with a trembling persistence.

The free warden moves fast. He drops to one knee on the clean stone, reaches into the rack debris, and finds two crude shims—broken wedge-like slats. He drives one at the top end of the hinge-plank with the heel of his palm, then the other at the bottom with a quick, brutal punch. The plank bites tighter into place with a dull *thunk-thunk*.

He grabs the looped chain from the wall-hook and wraps it around the plank and the nearest rack upright, then hauls it taut. The chain links squeal against wood; he braces and pulls until his knuckles go white. It’s not elegant, but it clamps the plank hard enough that the hinge edge can’t flex outward easily.

On the other side, the force changes immediately: the lifting attempt becomes a furious, upward *ratcheting* at the hinge pin.

Kest barks, “COUNT FOUR—PIN—PIN!” at the exact moment the top of the hinge pin rises a finger’s breadth—then stops dead with a sharp *ting* as Mark’s jam catches it.

The door bucks once, heavy and frustrated, sending a shock through your ribs and shoulder. The pin doesn’t rise further—but the jammed metal inside the hinge channel grinds, and you hear Mark hiss in pain as whatever he’s using bites into his hand.

Then a new sound: a thin, wet *snick* at the keyhole area, like something flexible being slipped in where the packed cloth is—testing, probing for a gap.

The hinge is held for now. The threat has shifted: they’re no longer winning with leverage, and are trying to defeat the keyhole pack with something narrow and slick.

### Turn 194 [PLAYER]

“Kest—keep eyes on that pin; if it moves again, shout. Warden—hold that chain clamp; don’t let it slack.”

Without lifting off the hinge seam, I call down, “Mark—pull your hand back. Are you bleeding? One word: ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ Don’t die down there.”

I spit onto my palm, scoop a pinch of grit and splinters, and flick it toward the keyhole seam. “Pack the keyhole with *abrasive*—grit, dust, anything. If that slick thing’s a wire or eel-skin, make it bite and snag. No fingers—use cloth on a stick or the edge of the bar.”

*Agent reasoning: The hinge is temporarily secured; the new vulnerability is the keyhole being probed with something slick. I should stop the probe without exposing fingers, reinforce the pack, and check Mark’s injury so he doesn’t lose his grip. Also gather intel: what tool is it, how many attackers, and buy time.*

### Turn 195 [GAME]

Kest plants himself where he can see the hinge top and the door edge at once. “COUNT FIVE—steady. COUNT SIX—no rise. I’m watching.”

The free warden keeps the chain cinched, one boot braced against the rack upright so it can’t creep. His arms tremble from holding tension. “Holding. If it slips, I’ll yell.”

Down at the keyhole level, Mark sucks in a breath and answers, hoarse: “Yes.” Then, after a beat, “Not… pouring.” You hear him scuff backward—him dragging his body away from the hinge channel like you ordered.

Your spit-wet grit flicks into the keyhole seam and the tiny gaps around the packed cloth. It turns the edge into a gritty paste. On the other side, the slick probe (wire or something coated) slides in another fraction—then *catches*. You hear a faint, irritated tugging, and the probe withdraws with a dry, sandpapery scrape.

The wardens take your cue. The free one tears a strip off the dry linen cloth (already in the room) and wraps it around the end of the iron chisel like a crude swab. He dips the cloth into dust and rack-splinters, then rams the cloth-wrapped tip toward the keyhole pack without putting fingers near it.

The result is immediate: the keyhole area makes a muffled *crunch* as grit compacts into the cloth and jambs the narrow opening. The slick probe tries again—pushes, flexes—then snags hard enough that it makes a sharp *twang* when it’s yanked back.

A new threat replaces it: a thin trickle of syrup begins to seep from the keyhole itself, dark and glossy, as if they’ve started feeding something through to dissolve or lubricate the jam. It threads down the door face toward the existing syrup line on the floor, thickening the hazard.

Kest’s voice tightens. “They’re changing tools. Pin’s still seated—keyhole’s bleeding syrup now.”

Mark coughs once from below. “I can… taste it. Don’t let it reach me.”

### Turn 196 [PLAYER]

“Mark—move back another arm’s length, now; keep your face turned away from the door. Warden, tear more cloth—make a trough, not a plug.”

Without lifting off the hinge seam, I nod toward the door’s lower edge. “Kest—give me a clear count if pressure changes, but also watch the syrup line: if it reaches the hinge-plank or Mark, shout.”

To the free warden: “Pack stays—don’t pull it. Lay folded cloth under the keyhole to *catch* the syrup and lead it sideways away from the hinge and away from Mark; if we’ve got dust or ash, heap it on the floor to thicken it into sludge.”

*Agent reasoning: Syrup may be corrosive/enchanted lubricant; letting it pool risks slips and could dissolve our jam. Need to divert/contain flow and keep Mark safe while maintaining hinge pressure. Minimal movement to avoid losing seal.*

### Turn 197 [GAME]

Mark drags himself back with a wet scrape of coat on stone—one full arm’s length, then another half as if fear lends him extra distance. He turns his face away like you ordered, voice muffled against his sleeve. “Back. Back.”

The free warden doesn’t touch the keyhole pack. He tears more of the dry linen into long strips, folds them into a shallow V, and shoves the “trough” under the keyhole drip so the syrup hits cloth instead of stone. The cloth darkens immediately, stiffening as it drinks. He angles the far end of the trough sideways—away from the hinge-plank and away from where Mark was. “It’s wicking. Slow, but it’s moving it.”

Kest crouches, eyes flicking between hinge-top and the syrup line. “COUNT SEVEN—pressure steady. COUNT EIGHT—no pin rise. Syrup’s moving left—slow.”

The warden heaps dust and splinters onto the floor where the cloth leads. The syrup hits the debris and turns into a tarry sludge instead of a slick pool—good for traction, bad because it starts to *pile*. It doesn’t spread as fast now, but the mass grows like a clogged drain.

On the other side of the door, the pushing changes: a heavy shove, then a pause, then another shove—testing whether the syrup can be forced through faster. The keyhole drip thickens from a thread to a steady ooze. The cloth trough holds for the moment, but it begins to sag under the weight, fibers stretching.

Then—sharp and unmistakable—a *match-scratch* sound from the other side. A faint sulfur sting leaks through the keyhole area.

Kest snaps, immediate. “COUNT NINE—tool change. I heard fire.”

The free warden freezes for a half-beat, then shifts his grip on the chain clamp as if bracing for a jolt. “If they light that syrup—”

A tiny ember-glow flashes at the keyhole seam, brief as a blink, like someone trying to touch flame to whatever’s seeping through. The threat is clear now: they’re attempting to ignite the syrup or use heat to ruin the cloth pack and trough, forcing an opening or smoking you out.

### Turn 198 [PLAYER]

“Kest—call ‘FIRE’ the instant you see glow again. Warden, keep that chain tight—do not move off the clamp.”

“Mark—stay back and cover your mouth. If you’ve got water, piss, anything liquid, get it ready but don’t crawl forward.”

I snap, “Tear the cloth trough away from the door—leave the keyhole pack, but get the wick off it. Now—smother the keyhole seam with *dust*, not cloth; pack ash, grit, wet mud if we can make it.” I keep my shoulder pinned to the hinge and add, low, “If they light it, we choke it—no air, no fuel.”

*Agent reasoning: Fire at the keyhole could turn the syrup into a fuse and the cloth into tinder; safest is to deny oxygen and remove combustibles near the seam while keeping the hinge secured. I should also check if we have anything nonflammable (stone dust, wet cloth, metal) to smother the ignition point without exposing hands.*

### Turn 199 [GAME]

Kest shifts closer to the keyhole line of sight without abandoning the hinge. “Understood. I see glow, I call FIRE.”

The free warden keeps the chain clamp locked, jaw clenched. “Clamp stays. I’m not moving.”

Mark, farther back, pulls his sleeve over his mouth and nose. “No water.” A pause, then, grim: “I can—if needed.” You hear him fumble at his belt, getting ready without coming forward.

At your snap, the free warden can’t comply—he’s anchored to the chain. The *other* warden (the one not clamping, down by the keyhole) acts instead: he yanks the cloth trough away from the door in one hard pull. The syrup-soaked linen peels off the stone with a sticky sound and drops into the debris pile where it immediately begins to glisten and slump.

The ooze at the keyhole, no longer wicked away, beads—then runs straight down the door face again, thick and glossy.

The warden grabs a double handful of dust and splinters and slaps it against the keyhole seam, grinding it in with the flat of his palm wrapped in a scrap of cloth so he doesn’t touch the syrup bare. It cakes into a gritty crust over the seam. A second handful follows, heavier—enough to choke the tiny gap.

For a breath, the drip slows.

Then the match-scratch comes again—closer, more deliberate. Kest barks, sharp as a bell: “FIRE!”

A pinpoint glow flares at the edge of the keyhole seam—immediately dulled by the dust-cake—but the syrup that has already run down the door catches anyway. It doesn’t whoosh; it *crawls*: a low, greasy line of flame licking along the glossy trail on the door face and down toward the floor.

Heat blooms against your shin and the warden’s hands. The air takes on a bitter, sweet-burn smell that claws at the throat.

The flame reaches the sludge pile where the torn trough landed. The soaked cloth there smolders, then gives a small hungry flare—brief but bright—before choking itself in black smoke.

Threat, clear and present: the syrup trail on the door is now actively burning and producing smoke; if it spreads to the larger syrup mass on the floor or reaches the hinge-plank, it could weaken your brace or force you to abandon position.

### Turn 200 [PLAYER]

“Kest—call where the flame’s headed: hinge-plank or floor pool. Mark—keep back; if you piss, do it into a cup/cloth and pass it, don’t crawl.”

To the nearest warden: “Dump dust—NOW—right on the burning line, heavy. Smother, don’t swipe.”  

Still pinned to the hinge, I hook my free hand to scrape at the syrup trail *above* the flame with the edge of the bar/chisel—break the glossy ‘wick’ into dry wood/stone—then bark, “Once it’s broken, bury the break in grit so it can’t rejoin!”

*Agent reasoning: Fire and smoke will force us off the hinge; we need to smother the crawling flame without introducing more fuel, keep the clamp, and protect breathing. Best is dust/earth/sand to choke it, and break the syrup trail so it can’t keep feeding. Also check if any stone/metal can be used as a scraper while staying pinned.*

### Turn 201 [GAME]

Kest’s head snaps between hinge and floor. “It’s crawling DOWN—floor pool first. Hinge-plank’s still clear, but the heat’s climbing.”

The nearest warden doesn’t swipe—he obeys exactly. He scoops dust and splinters with both hands and *dumps* it straight onto the burning line on the door face. The flame gutters immediately, turning into a dull orange creep under a collapsing crust. Smoke thickens for a second as it’s starved, then the visible fire on the door *goes out* in two uneven patches.

But the fire doesn’t end—it relocates. The syrup that already dripped to the floor has a small tongue of flame at its edge, and when the dust falls, it pushes burning droplets down into the sludge pile. The pile gives a brief flare again, then collapses into a smoking, tar-black mass that keeps *glowing* in pinpricks like embers in pitch.

You keep your shoulder pinned to the hinge and scrape above the extinguished line with the iron edge—chisel or bar—shaving the glossy syrup off stone/wood in rough strips. It works: you break the “wick” into dry patches that won’t carry flame. The scraping throws up hot, sticky flecks; one lands on your sleeve and smears, stinging through fabric before cooling into a tacky spot.

“Break made!” the warden says, and immediately buries the scraped gap in grit, grinding it down with his boot heel until it’s a matte, dusty scar instead of a sheen.

Mark’s voice, farther back, tight and muffled: “I can—” He stops to cough. “I’m filling cloth.” You hear him retch-gag once as the smoke reaches him, then the wet sound of him soaking something off to the side.

Consequence: the door-face flame is smothered and the syrup “wick” is broken, but the floor sludge is now a smoldering, ember-pricked tar that’s producing thick smoke and could reignite if fed air or fresh syrup. The keyhole seam, under dust, still oozes slowly—meaning more fuel is still arriving.

### Turn 202 [PLAYER]

“Kest—watch that pin and the keyhole; if the ooze speeds up, say so. Warden on the chain, don’t you budge.”

To the nearest warden, low and sharp: “Don’t kick it—cover the smoldering sludge with *stone dust* and any damp you can find, slow and thick, like burying coals. We need it sealed from air.”

I cough into my sleeve, keep my shoulder on the hinge, and rasp, “Mark—good. Pass that soaked cloth *away from the door*; we’ll use it to cap smoke near us, not feed flame at the seam.”

Then, without lifting off, I angle my boot to scrape a shallow moat of grit between the door and the sludge pile. “Make a dry break-line on the floor—no syrup bridge. If the drip resumes, it hits the break and dies.”

*Agent reasoning: The immediate danger is smoke and a smoldering fuel source that can reignite; I should reduce oxygen, contain embers, and stop more syrup from feeding the fire while keeping the hinge brace intact.*

### Turn 203 [GAME]

Kest shifts his stance to keep one eye on the keyhole area without leaving the hinge line. “Pin’s steady. Ooze is—” he leans, squints as another bead forms, “—still slow. Not surging.”

The chain-warden answers through clenched teeth, knuckles white on the clamp. “Not budging.”

At your instruction, the nearest warden stops using his boot entirely. He drags a rack-slat through the dust like a hoe, pulling pale stone grit over the ember-pricked sludge in slow heaps. It lands with soft *thumps*, and the pinprick glows dim under the new layer. He adds more until the mound is thick enough to hold its shape.

But the sludge is hot: the dust begins to *steam* in thin wisps, and the smell changes—less sweet-burn, more bitter tar. Smoke output drops for a moment… then puffs out through a tiny crack at the mound’s edge as trapped gases find a vent.

Mark, still back, crawls sideways along the wall—away from the door like you ordered—then extends an arm to slide a soaked cloth across the floor toward you. He never approaches the seam. “Here—wet. It’s—” he coughs hard, “—it’s piss.”

You scrape your boot and carve a shallow moat between the door and the buried sludge: a crescent of bare stone with a ridge of grit on your side. The nearest warden reinforces it, dragging more dust into a raised berm.

Outcome: you successfully create a dry break-line so any new drip has to cross bare stone before reaching the buried pile.

Consequence: the keyhole seam continues to ooze—slow, steady—and now the syrup hits the break-line and starts to *pool* on the door-side of the moat, forming a glossy, growing puddle that is unlit but very much fuel. The buried sludge is mostly smothered, yet it’s still hot enough to vent occasional smoke through cracks; if fresh syrup reaches it, it could reignite.

Threat: you’re buying time, not ending the hazard—fuel is accumulating again at the base of the door, and the other side has already shown they can introduce flame through the seam.

### Turn 204 [PLAYER]

“Kest—keep eyes on the keyhole; if you hear match-scratch or see glow, scream FIRE again. Also listen—are they moving away, or setting up something heavier?”

I nod at the puddle by the moat. “Warden—use the rack-slat to shove a *dust dam* right under the drip so it spreads wide and thin, not deep. No cloth near the seam.”

I take Mark’s soaked cloth with two fingers, wrap it around the end of the chisel like a cap, and press it down onto the *puddle only* on our side of the moat—smothering and cooling it in place. “Mark, good—stay back. If you can, find more liquid and keep it ready.”

Without lifting my shoulder from the hinge, I rasp to the chain-warden, “How long can you hold that clamp before your hands fail? Give me a number.”

*Agent reasoning: Fuel is accumulating again and they can ignite it through the seam; we need to deny ignition and stop/redirect the ooze without disturbing the hinge brace. Wet cloth can cool/smother the puddle, but must be kept away from the keyhole to avoid wicking. Also need to learn what’s on the other side—listen for tool changes.*

Kest puts his ear close to the seam, head turned so one eye still watches the keyhole crust. “No scratch yet.” He stills, listening harder. “Footsteps—backing off. Two sets. They’re not running; they’re… giving themselves room.” His voice tightens. “That’s ‘heavier’.”

The warden with the rack-slat obeys. He wedges the slat’s edge into the dust and builds a small berm directly under where the drip lands, shaping it into a shallow fan. The next bead of syrup hits the dam and spreads sideways instead of dropping into a deep puddle—thin, glossy, and wider, like varnish.

You take Mark’s soaked cloth with two fingers, cap the chisel tip, and press it down onto the pooled syrup on *your* side of the moat. It hisses faintly as the warmth meets wet cloth. The syrup underneath dulls from glossy to matte in patches as dust and moisture mix into a tacky paste. The immediate effect is good: it stops the puddle from flowing and lowers the chance a fresh spark will skitter across it.

Consequence: the cloth begins to *stick*. When you lift even slightly to reposition, strings of syrup cling and pull, trying to drag the wet cloth back toward the door-side fuel. It’s controllable, but it wants to bridge if you’re sloppy.

Mark stays back, coughing less now that the smoke has thinned. “I’ll—” cough, “—see if there’s a bucket. Or a chamber pot. Don’t move me.”

The chain-warden answers your question without looking up. “Two minutes. Maybe three.” His hands tremble visibly at the clamp. “After that my fingers go dead and the chain slips, and I’m not guessing which.”

Then—faint but distinct—wood scrapes on wood from the far side of the door, like something long being dragged into position. Kest goes rigid. “They’re setting a brace. Or a ram.”

Threat, clear: the other side is preparing a heavier forced entry. Your clamp-holder is on a short clock, and if the door takes a full hit while syrup continues to ooze at the seam, you risk both structural failure and renewed ignition.

### Turn 206 [PLAYER]

“Kest—call the rhythm the instant they start their run-up; I want a count to the hit.”

To the free warden: “Get behind me and brace the hinge-plank with your shoulder—stack your weight into it. If there’s a table, bench, anything solid, drag it in as a deadman brace against the door—*now*.”

I rasp to the chain-warden, “On my mark you rotate hands—one at a time—don’t let the chain slack. We’ll trade you out if we can.”

Keeping my shoulder planted, I peel the sticky wet cloth off the chisel carefully and drop it flat over the *matte paste* only—no dragging—then grind dust into the remaining gloss with the chisel edge. “No clean syrup lines. Nothing for flame to run.”

Then, low to Mark: “Forget searching—stay put. If the door goes, you run for the stairwell and shout alarm.”

*Agent reasoning: A ram is coming and our clamp-holder is near collapse; I need to redistribute load, improve bracing, and reduce fire risk before impact while gathering intel on what they’re doing.*

### Turn 207 [GAME]

Kest nods once, jaw set, and keeps his ear close to the seam. “I’ll count.”

The free warden moves in behind you immediately, shoulder-to-shoulder but staggered so he can stack weight into the hinge-plank without knocking you off it. He plants his boots wide on the gritty stone and leans in. “Got you.”

He glances around for anything solid. There’s no table—just storage racks bolted to the wall and the low service hatch at the passage end. He hooks his arm around the nearest rack upright and tries to wrench it free; it doesn’t budge. The bolts hold. “Nothing loose. Racks are fixed!”

At the chain, the clamped warden swallows and nods, eyes glassy with strain. He shifts one hand a hair, testing the edge of failure. “On your mark.”

You manage the wet cloth cleanly: you peel it off without dragging a syrup-string back toward the seam, drop it flat over the tacky matte paste, and grind dust into the remaining gloss with the chisel edge. The door-side syrup fan is now mostly dulled and gritty; there are no clean, continuous shiny “lanes” for flame to race along.

Mark answers with a hoarse, “Understood,” and crawls another half-body length away from the door, closer to the direction of the stairwell.

Then the other side commits.

Kest’s head snaps up. “Run-up—NOW. One—two—three—”

On “three” the door takes a *full-body* impact: a deep, chest-rattling THUD that shudders through hinge and plank. Dust jumps off the racks. The hinge-plank flexes under your shoulders; the warden behind you grunts as the force tries to peel you both off the brace.

The chain goes taut with a metallic *twang*. The clamp-warden’s hands slip a fraction—just a fraction—before he bites down again, wrists shaking violently. “Still—holding!”

A thin line of grit at the keyhole seam cracks and a fresh bead of syrup squeezes out faster than before, pushed by the shock. It runs into your dust dam and spreads, but it’s now coming *steadier*—not a single bead.

Kest, eyes wide, listens again. “They’re backing up for another. Heavier this time.”

Threat: a second impact is imminent, and the last hit increased the ooze rate; if the door or chain gives, you’ll have a forced entry into a smoke-hazed, syrup-smeared threshold where a single spark could re-light everything.

### Turn 208 [PLAYER]

“Mark—GO. Stairwell, now. Shout alarm, ‘syrup-fire at the service door,’ don’t stop.”

“Kest—keep counting; if you hear them shift from run-up to *ram* setup, tell me. Warden behind me, lock in—feet wide, don’t let the plank walk.”

To the clamp-warden, sharp: “On my mark, rotate right hand off for one breath—shake it—back on. Left stays clamped. Mark—NOW.” 

I jerk my chin at the bolted racks. “Free warden—rip a slat loose if you can; wedge it under the hinge-plank as a chock. If nothing breaks, shove your boot hard against the plank base and hold it like a stop.”

I cough, then scrape a fresh load of dust and grit up into a thick ridge directly under the keyhole seam. “If the ooze surges on the next hit, we bury it—no clean trail, no flame path.”

*Agent reasoning: Another heavier hit could break the door or chain; I need an exit plan and to reduce fire risk. I should get Mark moving to raise alarm, reinforce bracing with what’s available, and manage the clamp-warden’s imminent hand failure by rotating or swapping someone in.*

### Turn 209 [GAME]

Mark doesn’t argue. He scrambles up from his crouch and half-runs, half-staggers down the passage toward the stairwell, one hand clamped over his mouth. His shout starts as a rasp and turns into a raw bellow as he gains distance: “ALARM—SYRUP-FIRE AT THE SERVICE DOOR—ALARM!” His footsteps fade, then echo again as he hits stairs.

Kest stays glued to the seam. “Listening.”

The warden behind you locks in harder—boots splayed, hips low, shoulder driving into the hinge-plank so it can’t “walk” sideways. “Plank’s steady. I’ll take the hit.”

At the clamp, you call the rotation. The chain-warden nods once, then peels his right hand off for a single breath. The chain shivers—audibly—and the clamp creaks, but his left hand holds. He shakes the right hand violently, fingers clawing open and shut once, then slams it back on. “Back.” His voice is thin with pain, but the clamp remains engaged; no slack is given.

The free warden goes for the racks. He jams fingers under a slat and yanks until his knuckles split; the wood groans but doesn’t come free—then, with a sharp crack, a thinner crosspiece snaps instead. He snatches the broken length and drops to wedge it under the hinge-plank as a chock. It bites awkwardly into the uneven stone, but it does add a stop. “Chock in!”

You scrape and heap fresh dust and grit into a thick ridge under the keyhole seam. The syrup that’s already oozing hits the ridge and spreads into it, turning the top layer into a sticky, gritty crust.

Then Kest stiffens. “They’re not backing for a run-up.” He tilts his head, listening to the other side’s movements. “They’re *building*. Wood on wood. Something being set across—”

A low, synchronized grunt comes through the door—several voices. The door shudders once, not from impact but from pressure testing.

Threat: they’ve shifted to a braced ram or lever. Instead of one big hit, you’re about to face sustained, coordinated force that will steadily defeat the hinge-plank and the clamp unless relieved—while the keyhole seam continues to ooze faster with every vibration.
