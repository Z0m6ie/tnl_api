### Turn 4 [PLAYER]

Vesper Lorne grew up in the soot-stained backrooms of a decaying coastal metropolis, learning early that secrets breed faster than mold. A freelance arcane investigator with a weakness for asking the wrong questions in the right places, they prowl crime scenes and candlelit salons alike, cataloging the city’s magic with clinical curiosity and a razor-dry wit. Inquisitive, stubborn, and infuriatingly perceptive, Vesper keeps tangling with a rival enforcer from the shadow court—equal parts threat and temptation. Their goal: expose the hidden engine behind the city’s cursed romances and corpses before it swallows them, preferably without falling for the one person sworn to stop them.

*Agent reasoning: Generated curious-style character for Noir romantasy, passionate, enemies-to-lovers*

### Turn 5 [GAME]

Here's your character:

**Vesper Lorne**
*Freelance Arcane Investigator (occult forensics, cursework, and clandestine intelligence)*

Vesper Lorne was raised in the soot-stained backrooms and salt-rotted alleys of a decaying coastal metropolis, where rumors were currency and every favor had a hidden price. They apprenticed under a disgraced occult archivist, learning to read crime scenes like spellwork and to treat romance like another kind of curse—beautiful, lethal, and never accidental. Now Vesper survives on case fees, blackmail threats, and the uneasy reputation of being the investigator who notices what everyone else is paid to ignore.

**Traits:** Razor-dry wit, Inquisitive to a fault, Stubbornly principled, Infuriatingly perceptive, Cool-headed under pressure
**Goal:** Unmask the hidden engine orchestrating the city’s cursed romances and ritualized deaths—before it claims Vesper—while outmaneuvering (and resisting feelings for) their shadow-court rival enforcer who is sworn to shut the investigation down.

### Turn 9 [GAME]

Morning in **Gullhook Row**, Brinewick’s dockside warren, arrives as a dim gray smear behind salt fog. Your office sits above a shuttered bait shop, the stairwell smelling of fish-oil and cheap violet incense. Outside, a Mourning Office checkpoint bell clinks on the corner, and the gaslamps still burn like they forgot it’s day.

You’re at your desk with yesterday’s case photos spread under a cracked magnifier. A thin line of chalk dust marks where you tested for residue sigils, and your coat is still damp at the cuffs from leaning over seawall stones. You’re scraping wax from a seal with a scalpel, careful not to tear the paper—old habit from an archivist’s backroom, where the truth was always folded small.

Three soft taps land on your door. Not knuckles. A mourner’s code.

When you open it, the hall is empty. On the floor sits a **Civic Mourning Office satchel**, salt-damp, tagged with your name in immaculate ink. The strap is tied with **dock-twine** you recognize from the Drownmarket piers. Inside: a grief permit stamped **UNREGISTERED**, still tacky as if rushed; a **Sableglass Theater** masque invitation that leaks perfume into your fingertips; and a shard of **black glass** wrapped in tar paper. You tilt the shard toward the window. The reflection is wrong—your desk is there, but the shadows don’t match. For a second they arrange into a lovers’ sigil you’ve only seen half-scraped off alley brick before the “Emergency Decency Audit” crews arrived.

From the street below, a clerk’s voice carries through the fog: “Audit sweep moving east. Seal the next block. Confiscate papers.” The checkpoint bell clinks again, closer this time.

The satchel is contraband, the permit could get you through sealed streets, and the invitation is a timed lure. You’re standing in your doorway with evidence that shouldn’t exist and footsteps coming up the stairs.

### Turn 10 [PLAYER]

I scoop the satchel inside and lock the door, sliding the chain on—then press the black glass shard to my palm and whisper a quick reveal-thread to see what kind of lovers’ sigil it’s echoing. After a glance, I shove the shard and invitation into the hollowed ledger in my desk and keep the grief permit handy, moving to the door. “One moment—Mourning Office business,” I call, trying to sound bored and official.

*Agent reasoning: Audit boots on the stairs means I need to hide contraband fast, but I’m too curious not to sample the magic on that black glass and invitation; the permit might be my best bluff if I get cornered.*

### Turn 11 [GAME]

The satchel’s leather leaves a wet salt print on your floorboards as you yank it in and throw the lock. The chain slides home with a metallic cough.

You press the black glass shard to your palm. It’s colder than seawater in winter. When you whisper the reveal-thread, the shard answers with a faint vibration that climbs your bones like a tuning fork. A hairline cut opens where the edge kisses skin—no gush, just a bead of blood that the glass seems eager to drink.

In the shard’s reflection, your office shadows detach from their corners and braid together into a sigil: two figures back-to-back, each holding the other’s throat with a ribbon. The ribbon knots into a lantern shape at the center—**a Lacquered Lantern binding mark**—but the outer ring is municipal: tidy little registry ticks like those on Mourning Office forms. It isn’t just romance. It’s *filed* romance.

The perfume from the invitation thickens as you focus on it—violet-amber ash, sweet enough to make your tongue feel slow. For half a second, the printed masquerade text seems to shift, as if it’s trying to replace your name with someone else’s.

Footsteps reach your landing.

You slide shard and invitation into the hollowed ledger in your desk. The moment the ledger closes, the room feels fractionally warmer, like you’ve shut a window on the sea. You keep the grief permit in hand—its stamp reads **UNREGISTERED** in red, the ink still slightly raised.

You move to the door and call out, bored and crisp: “One moment—Mourning Office business.”

On the other side, a pause. Then a man’s voice, young, careful, trained to sound harmless.

“Registrar’s assistant. **Tollin Wreave**. Audit support.” Paper rustles. “We’re verifying permits on this stair. I’ll need to see yours through the gap, Investigator Lorne.”

Something thin slides against the wood near the latch—metal, testing, not forcing. A second set of steps stops one flight below and stays there, silent.

Wreave adds, softer: “Chain stays on. Just… show the stamp. Quick as breath.”

If you open the door more than the chain allows, they’ll have a line of sight into your office. If you don’t show it, they can mark you noncompliant and call in the checkpoint bell.

```

### Turn 12 [PLAYER]

I open the door only to the chain’s bite and slide the grief permit into view, thumb covering the “UNREGISTERED” like it’s an old coffee stain. “There. Stamp’s clean—so why are you testing my latch, Tollin?” I angle my head toward the stairwell. “And tell your friend below to stop holding their breath. It’s making the building nervous.”

*Agent reasoning: I want to buy time and learn who’s really on the stairs; I’ll comply just enough to avoid escalation while trying to catch a glimpse and probe for the second person.*

### Turn 13 [GAME]

The door opens to the chain’s limit, giving you a wedge of foggy stairwell and Tollin Wreave’s face—too clean for this building, hair combed like he’s expecting a photograph. He’s holding a clipboard and a Mourning satchel; his eyes snap to the permit the instant it appears.

Your thumb hides the red **UNREGISTERED**, but the raised ink catches the stairwell light at the edge of your nail.

Tollin’s gaze lingers there a fraction too long. The thin metal you felt at the latch withdraws immediately—he tucks a little flat pick back behind his clipboard as if it was always just a pen.

“Testing?” he repeats, smile tight. “No, sir. Old locks. Buildings swell in the fog.”

At your comment about the breathing, the silence below breaks: a small, deliberate cough from one landing down—polite, practiced, like a signal. A man you can’t fully see shifts position; you catch the corner of a grief-permit satchel and a pale hand on the rail. He doesn’t come up. He just *listens*.

Tollin clears his throat and, without asking, reaches two fingers toward the permit as if to “steady it for a look.” His nails are ink-stained, the kind you get handling registry books all day.

“Let me just confirm the seal impression,” he says. “Audit protocol. Quick as breath.”

Behind him, farther down the stairs, the checkpoint bell on the street gives a single clink—answered by a second clink, closer, like someone has stepped under it.

Tollin’s voice drops, still friendly: “If the stamp’s clean, this takes five seconds. If it isn’t… I have to log the address.”

The threat is plain: if he gets his fingers on the permit, he can tilt it into the light and catch the **UNREGISTERED**. If you deny him, he can mark you for a compliance visit—possibly with more than two people next time.

*Triggered: watcher_Ward The Stairwell_0_f676bb*

### Turn 14 [PLAYER]

I pull the permit back a hair and angle it so the stamp stays in shadow. “Seal impressions are verified against the ledger entry number—unless the Mourning Office rewrote its own protocol overnight.”  

I tap the paper with my knuckle, not letting him touch it. “What’s my file number, Tollin? Say it out loud. And while you’re at it—whose pick were you using on my latch?”

*Agent reasoning: Tollin’s trying to get the permit into the light; I need to keep control of the paper while probing who’s really behind this. I’ll distract with procedure, force him to talk, and use a tiny smear/crease to obscure the raised ink while I read his reaction.*

### Turn 15 [GAME]

You pull the permit back and cant it into the door’s shadow. The raised edge of the stamp stops flashing. Tollin’s two fingers hang in the air a beat too long—then retreat to the clipboard.

His smile thins into something administrative.

“Ledger entry number,” he repeats, like he’s tasting whether it’s worth arguing. “That’s for *registered* grief permits.” His eyes flick, involuntary, to where your thumb is covering the lower-left of the stamp. “These new Audit-issued slips are… simplified.”

You tap the paper with your knuckle. The sound is sharp in the cramped stairwell.

“What’s my file number, Tollin? Say it out loud.”

Tollin looks down at his clipboard as if it’s going to rescue him. He wets his lips. “Lorne, Vesper. Freelance investigator. Prior liaison—” He stops. There is no number to read, and you can see him decide, in real time, not to say that part.

“And whose pick were you using on my latch?”

The “friend” below takes one step up—close enough that you can finally see him: broad-shouldered, coat too fine for this stairwell, Mourning satchel carried like a prop. Not a clerk. His eyes are flat and amused, and he’s wearing black gloves despite the indoor warmth.

He speaks, calm as a receipt: “Protocol’s flexible during an Emergency Decency Audit.”

Tollin’s throat bobs. He shifts his body half an inch to block your view into the stairwell as if *he’s* the door now. “Investigator, please. Don’t make this difficult. We can log you compliant and be gone.”

The gloved man’s hand drops to the satchel at his hip. Not reaching for a weapon—reaching for papers.

“A notice,” he says. “Impending classification. Unregistered grief.” He lets the words hang where your permit can hear them.

Threat, clear and immediate: if they log you *noncompliant* or *unregistered*, Mourning Office authority can legally seal your office and seize “indecent” materials—today, not later. And the man below is ready to serve it the moment Tollin stops pretending this is a routine check.

*Triggered: watcher_Ward The Stairwell_0_f676bb*

### Turn 16 [PLAYER]

I keep the chain on and smile like I’m bored enough to be dangerous. “Impending classification requires a named signatory. So—gloves: give me your name and division, and I’ll decide whether I’m laughing or complying.”

I raise the permit just enough to show the seal’s edge, never the whole stamp. “Tollin, you and I both know ‘simplified’ slips still have a routing mark. Read me the routing mark, and I’ll hold still while you ‘log’ me.”

Then I lean closer to the crack, voice low. “And if you’re here for something other than a permit check, say it plainly—because my office is warded for forced entry, and I’d hate for you to bleed on municipal stationery.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re fishing for an excuse to classify me and seize my office; I need to stall, learn who the gloved man is, and redirect them with something that sounds like internal Mourning Office procedure—while keeping the chain on and my contraband out of sight.*

### Turn 17 [GAME]

The chain stays taut. Your smile doesn’t move your eyes.

For a moment Tollin looks relieved you’re arguing procedure instead of swinging the door wide—then your mention of wards makes his relief curdle into fear. He glances down the stairs the way clerks glance at supervisors.

The gloved man steps up into full view, one hand still on the rail, the other producing a folded document with a Mourning Office seal—real wax, fresh press. He holds it up so you can see the header through the crack:

**NOTICE OF IMPENDING CLASSIFICATION — UNREGISTERED GRIEF**

No signature line is visible from your angle, just the seal and a block of dense, weaponized language.

“Name,” you say. “Division.”

He gives you a small, tired look. “You don’t get my name. You get compliance.”

Then he does something concrete: he reaches past Tollin and hooks a thin strip of paper—an official logging tag—onto your doorchain. The tag is threaded with a black fiber that looks like hair. It doesn’t *bite* the chain, but it clings like it wants to.

Tollin, voice tight, reads from his clipboard anyway, trying to salvage the fiction. “Routing mark is… D-9, salt docket, Audit annex.”

It’s too fast, too smooth—memorized. And wrong in a way that’s hard to prove without the ledger.

Your permit’s stamp-edge catches light again. Tollin’s pupils tighten. He sees enough.

The gloved man continues, measured: “We’re here for a withdrawal statement. You sign that you’re stepping away from the vanished-couples inquiry. In exchange, we log you compliant and the Audit doesn’t seal your office tonight.”

He taps the notice with one gloved finger. *Tap.* “You don’t sign, we file you as unregistered grief. That authorizes a decency seizure. Wards or not, they’ll bring a Mourning keywright and a Bailiff to witness.”

Downstairs, the checkpoint bell clinks again—closer now—and you hear a third set of footsteps enter the stairwell, heavier, unhurried.

The threat is immediate and specific: they’re escalating from “permit check” to “serve notice + force withdrawal,” and reinforcements are arriving to make refusal expensive.

*Triggered: watcher_Ward The Stairwell_0_f676bb*

### Turn 18 [PLAYER]

I lean in and study the logging tag on my chain like it’s a bug. “That fiber—human or horse? Don’t tell me you’re tagging my threshold with sympathetic hair and calling it ‘protocol.’”  

Then I lift my voice toward the stairwell, crisp and public. “Third set of boots: if you’re a Bailiff, announce yourself for the record. I’m being served an unsigned notice by an unnamed division.”  

I keep the door on the chain and add, quieter to Tollin, “You’re in over your head. Slip me the signatory name and I can make this clean for you.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re trying to box me into signing or getting sealed; I want to stall, gather names/evidence, and probe that hair-thread tag for occult function while looking for an alternate exit.*

### Turn 19 [GAME]

You get close enough to see the fiber for what it is: not horsehair—too fine, too dark, and it lies against the metal like it recognizes it. It’s been lacquered with something that dulls the shine of the chain where it touches, leaving a faint matte crescent on the link.

Tollin flinches when you say “sympathetic hair.” His eyes dart to the gloved man, then to the stairs, as if checking whether he’s allowed to react.

Your voice carries down the stairwell.

The heavier boots stop. A pause—long enough to be deliberate—then a voice answers from the dark below the half-landing, smooth and almost bored:

“Bailiff Kettle. Shadow Court mediation detail.”

As he speaks, the gaslamp on the landing gutter-flares—steady, then a sudden bright lick of light along the banister. In that flare you see it: a shadow shaped wrong, folded into the darkest wedge beneath the half-landing where banister meets wall. It’s not attached to any feet you can see. It lies on the steps like a patient blade, angled toward your threshold.

When the flame steadies, the shadow is still there—thicker than it should be, as if it’s soaking up light.

The gloved man doesn’t look back. He only tilts his head a fraction, satisfied Kettle announced himself.

Tollin swallows hard at your quiet warning. His hand tightens on the clipboard until the paper creases. He whispers, barely moving his lips: “I don’t have—” then stops, because the gloved man’s gaze snaps to him like a leash.

Kettle’s boots start again, slow, one step up, then another—never crossing fully into the gaslamp’s brightest strip. His body remains mostly out of sight around the corner, but his *shadow* inches forward on the stair treads, testing the edge of the light like it’s feeling for a gap.

Kettle speaks again, still from below, voice carrying: “For the record: you’re being offered a clean exit. Don’t make it theatrical, Lorne.”

Concrete threat: the tag on your chain is now a sympathetic anchor at your threshold, and Kettle’s unnatural shadow is probing toward the doorcrack—staying just shy of the lamp-bright line, like it’s waiting for someone to shift, dim the light, or open wider.

*Triggered: watcher_Ward The Stairwell_0_f676bb, guard_Ward The Stairwell_0_0d98e5*

### Turn 20 [PLAYER]

I hook my finger through the chain link just inside the crack and scrape my thumbnail hard against the lacquered fiber, trying to peel or snap it without jostling the lamp-light. “Tagging my threshold with hair is theatrical, Bailiff.”

Without looking away from the tag, I call out, “Kettle—Shadow Court mediation still requires a named petitioner. Who filed for this ‘clean exit’?” Then, to Tollin in a near-whisper, “If you can’t give me a signatory, give me a *departmental cipher*—one letter. I’ll do the rest.”

*Agent reasoning: The sympathetic tag is an immediate foothold; Kettle’s shadow suggests a light-bound incursion. I want to test the tag without opening the door, keep everything on-record to pressure them, and try to turn Tollin into a leak.*

### Turn 21 [GAME]

Your thumbnail bites into the lacquered fiber.

It doesn’t peel like glue. It *shears*—a dry, gritty snap—leaving a short bristle still threaded through the tag’s hole. The moment it breaks, the matte crescent on the chain link deepens, as if the metal just remembered being cold. The remaining bristle twitches once, like a cut nerve, then lies still.

The logging tag itself loosens and slides half an inch down the chain, no longer “hugging” the link. You’ve damaged whatever sympathetic purchase it had, but you haven’t removed the tag entirely; part of the anchor is still present.

From below, Kettle’s voice comes up the stairwell, amused in that professional way that never reaches kindness. “Petitioner prefers not to be named.”

His shadow advances two treads at once—too fast for the pace of his boots. It lengthens toward the doorcrack, thinning as it goes, like ink pulled under a knife. It stops just short of the bright strip cast by the landing lamp, pressing against the light-line as if it’s testing how firm reality is today.

The gloved man finally answers your “theatrical” remark by pulling a pen from inside his sleeve. Not a fountain pen—something with a blunt nib meant for carbon forms. He taps it against the notice. *Tap tap.* “Sign, and the tag comes off. Refuse, and we start logging what’s inside your office as ‘indecent materials.’”

Tollin’s eyes flick to your hand on the chain, then to the damaged bristle, and you see him decide to save himself.

He whispers, fast and ragged: “Cipher—” He hesitates as the gloved man’s gaze pins him. Tollin forces it out anyway, barely audible: “**L**.”

The gloved man’s jaw tightens. His free hand closes around Tollin’s clipboard hard enough the board creaks.

Kettle’s boots stop again. His shadow stays pressed to the edge of the lamp-light, poised—waiting for the smallest change: the door opening wider, the lamp guttering, or you stepping back from the threshold.

### Turn 22 [PLAYER]

I keep my finger hooked in the chain and, very carefully, slide the loosened tag down toward the inside latch, trying to strip it off the chain without widening the crack. “Cipher L. Good—now we’re speaking an actual language.”

I raise my voice slightly, calm. “Bailiff Kettle, for the record: I’m refusing to sign an unnamed petitioner’s withdrawal statement under threat of decency seizure. If you want ‘mediation,’ state what matter is being mediated.”

Then I look straight at Tollin through the gap. “Walk away, Tollin. You’ve done enough. If they punish you for one letter, I’ll make sure your supervisor’s supervisor hears about the pick on my latch.”

*Agent reasoning: I got a cipher—“L”—so I should pocket that and stall. The shadow is probing the light-line; I need to keep the lamp steady and remove the remaining bristle/tag without widening the door. Also, Tollin just stuck his neck out; I can use that to sow discord and maybe get a name.*

### Turn 23 [GAME]

You slide the tag down the chain toward the inside latch, millimeter by millimeter. It catches once on a burr in the link—then clears. The paper scrapes softly, a bureaucrat’s whisper.

At the latch, the tag snags again: the remaining bristle is still threaded through its hole, and the hole is too small to pass over the latch’s thicker metal. You can’t fully strip it without either tearing the tag or opening the door wider. You do manage to pull the tag flush against the inside hardware, tucking it out of the crack’s line—reducing whatever line-of-sight the stairwell has on it.

The gloved man sees the movement anyway. His pen stops tapping.

Kettle answers your raised voice from below, tone flattening into official recitation. “Mediation matter: breach of civic decency by continued pursuit of sealed romantic-ritual deaths. Petitioner alleges harassment of protected mourners.”

As he says *protected mourners*, his shadow does something new: it spreads sideways along the edge of the lamp-light, like liquid trying to find a seam. It doesn’t cross the bright line—but it begins to *map* it, tracing the boundary as if learning where it will be weakest if the flame gutters.

Tollin’s face goes pale at “protected mourners.” That phrase has teeth in the Mourning Office; it means someone important is in the ledger.

You tell him to walk away.

He tries.

Tollin shifts his weight back, turning his shoulder—then the gloved man’s hand clamps the top of Tollin’s clipboard and yanks him forward half a step, using him like a hooked coat. Tollin makes a small, involuntary sound, and the papers on the board flutter.

“Registrar’s assistant,” the gloved man says quietly, “you’re staying until this is logged.”

Then, to you, still controlled: “For the record, refusal noted. Next step is service and entry with witness.”

He reaches into his coat and produces a thin brass token stamped with the Mourning Office’s crescent—an entry warrant marker. He doesn’t present it through the crack; he just lets you see it.

Downstairs, Kettle finally comes into partial view: a shoulder, a gloved hand on the banister, and a strip of face in gaslight. He doesn’t climb into the brightest patch. He angles his chin toward your door.

Concrete threat, now immediate: they are moving from “pressure” to “forced entry with a keywright and Bailiff witness.” Kettle’s shadow is actively testing the light boundary, and Tollin has been physically restrained—meaning they’re willing to escalate and create leverage if you don’t comply.

### Turn 24 [PLAYER]

I tear the logging tag in half at the latch—slow, controlled—so the bristled hole stays on the *outside* half and the rest stays with me, then I press my thumb to the chain-link’s matte crescent and murmur a quick unbinding charm under my breath.  

Out loud, level: “Show the brass token through the crack, close enough for me to read the strike-marks. Otherwise it’s theater, not service.”  

I raise my voice toward the stairs. “Bailiff Kettle, if you authorize entry on an unsigned notice with an unnamed petitioner, I’ll file a Shadow Court complaint naming you personally—and I’ll subpoena the keywright’s book. Last chance: tell me which ‘protected mourner’ I supposedly harassed. Initials are fine.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to force entry; I need to stall while extracting info and maybe sever the sympathetic tag. “Protected mourners” suggests a high-status petitioner—cipher L might be enough to narrow it. I’ll demand proper service through the crack, threaten liability, and quietly prep a warded countermeasure using the lamp-light boundary while I tear the tag to remove the bristle anchor.*

### Turn 26 [PLAYER]

I tear the logging tag in half at the latch—slow and controlled—keeping the bristled hole with the outside portion, and I murmur an unbinding under my breath while pressing my thumb to the chain’s matte crescent.  

“Token through the crack, close enough to read strike-marks, or it’s not service.”  

Then, louder toward the stairs: “Bailiff Kettle—name the protected mourner I ‘harassed.’ Initials are fine. If you force entry on an unsigned notice and unnamed petitioner, I’ll file a Shadow Court complaint naming you and subpoena the keywright’s book.”

*Agent reasoning: The scene stalled; I want to keep pressure on them while exploiting the moment to clear the sympathetic tag and force them to reveal anything verifiable.*

### Turn 28 [PLAYER]

I tear the logging tag in half at the latch—slow and controlled—keeping the bristled hole with the outside portion, and press my thumb to the chain’s matte crescent while murmuring a quick unbinding under my breath.  

“Token through the crack, close enough to read strike-marks, or it’s not service.”  

Then, louder toward the stairs: “Bailiff Kettle—name the protected mourner I ‘harassed.’ Initials are fine. If you force entry on an unsigned notice and unnamed petitioner, I’ll file a Shadow Court complaint naming you and subpoena the keywright’s book.”

*Agent reasoning: The tag is still anchoring something at my threshold and Kettle’s shadow is testing the light; I need to break the sympathetic link, verify the warrant token, and force them to commit to a name/initials on record before they can twist the narrative.*

### Turn 29 [GAME]

The paper gives with a dry, fibrous sigh. You tear slow, controlled—right at the latch where the tag’s hole won’t pass. The outside half keeps the bristled hole and the little official serial; the inside half stays in your fingers, a useless strip of bureaucracy with just enough ink to be incriminating if someone wants it to be.

Your thumb presses the chain-link’s matte crescent. You murmur the unbinding.

The charm *takes*—but not cleanly.

The chain doesn’t fall. Instead, the metal goes briefly cold, as if it’s remembering a different shape. The crescent mark under your thumb pales a shade, like chalk rubbed thin. The latch gives a tiny, involuntary click—half a release—then holds, as though something on the other side is keeping tension on it.

Outside, the gloved man hears that click. His head tilts a fraction.

You speak, level: token through the crack.

He doesn’t comply. He steps closer, and you see the brass token again, but held back from the gap—displayed for intimidation, not inspection. “You don’t get to audit my marks,” he says. “You get to sign, or you get to be witnessed.”

Downstairs, Bailiff Kettle answers your raised voice without moving into the brightest patch. “Careful with threats, Lorne.”

Then he gives you what you asked for—crookedly, like a bone tossed to a dog. “Initials: **E. S.** That’s all you’re owed.”

The gloved man’s free hand tightens on Tollin’s clipboard. Tollin flinches, and you hear the board’s clip creak. The registrar’s assistant’s eyes flick to you—pleading, angry, trapped.

Kettle continues, voice carrying up the stairwell: “Unsigned notice becomes signed the moment you refuse under service. Keywright’s book won’t help you if the entry is lawful.”

Concrete threat: they’re not negotiating. Kettle is prepared to call a keywright and force the chain, and the gloved man is actively using Tollin as leverage. Your unbinding partially weakened the latch, but the tension from the hallway side is preventing it from releasing fully—meaning if they apply force with tools, your chain will likely give faster than it would have before.

### Turn 30 [PLAYER]

I slide the torn inside-half of the tag into my sleeve and step away from the crack, keeping my voice even. “Fine—witness it. But you’ll do it clean.”

I call down the stairs to Kettle. “E.S. noted. Before you bring a keywright, answer one thing for the record: is E.S. a mourner under *Court seal* or *Office seal*? Yes or no.”

Then, quieter, I move back into my office and start sweeping anything obviously occult off my desk into the bottom drawer—fast but careful—while murmuring a small steadiness-ward at the doorframe to keep the lamp-light from guttering.

*Agent reasoning: They’re stonewalling on the token and readying forced entry; I need leverage and information. E.S. is a lead, and Tollin’s a hostage—so I’ll buy time, hide anything sensitive, and try to flip the gloved man by forcing a procedural misstep while I prep a ward.*

### Turn 31 [GAME]

The torn inside-half of the tag disappears up your sleeve with a soft rasp of paper on wool. You step back from the door. The crack goes dark as your shadow leaves it.

“Fine—witness it. But you’ll do it clean.”

A pause downstairs—just long enough to hear Tollin’s breathing hitch.

You call down: Court seal or Office seal?

Bailiff Kettle answers immediately, and too smoothly. “Neither. Protective custody. Shadow Court discretion.” He doesn’t say *yes* or *no*. He says it like a loophole he’s used before.

The gloved man at your door gives a small, satisfied exhale and raps the notice against the jamb—tap, tap—like punctuation. “You heard him.”

Then Kettle adds, louder, to make sure you hear the next part: “Keywright’s already on the way. You want clean? Don’t make him work.”

Inside, you turn from the door and start clearing your desk. The obvious pieces—salt-chalk, a thumbed folio of sigil tracings, the stoppered vial that always looks like it’s sweating—go into the bottom drawer. You’re fast, but careful: no clinks, no spills. The drawer slides shut with a controlled thud.

You murmur the steadiness-ward at the doorframe. The lamp-light stops its nervous fluttering and holds steady—warmer, less prone to gutter.

But the ward also *shows you something*: a thin, hairlike shadow line draped across the top corner of the frame, not part of the woodgrain. A listening filament—fine work, the kind that turns vibrations in a door into a faint readable whisper.

Outside, the gloved man shifts his weight, and the filament quivers in sympathy. They’re already taking notes on your tone, your cadence—anything that can be rewritten later as “admission” or “threat.”

From the stairwell below comes the scrape of boots and a new sound: metal tools clinking in a roll. Someone is indeed coming up—keywright or Bailiff aide—close enough now that you can place each step on the stairs.

Threat, clear and immediate: forced entry is minutes away, and your ward has confirmed the doorframe is being used to listen in on you right now.

### Turn 32 [PLAYER]

I lean close to the door and say clearly, for the filament, “Understood—protective custody, Shadow Court discretion. I’ll cooperate and I won’t destroy evidence.”

Then I step back, take my salt-chalk from the drawer just long enough to draw a tiny closed loop over the top corner of the frame—right where the hairline shadow sits—murmuring, “No ear, no tongue,” and snap my fingers to deaden the filament.

While they’re coming up, I grab my coat and my travel case, and I check the back window latch—quietly—looking for an alternate way out or a place to stash the occult pieces if they breach.

*Agent reasoning: There’s a listening filament on the frame and forced entry is imminent; I want to both mislead their recording and quietly disable the filament while preparing an exit/contingency.*

### Turn 33 [GAME]

You speak into the door like it’s a court stenographer. The filament at the frame’s corner trembles—*taking it*—and somewhere beyond the wood, a faint scratch of pencil stops, then resumes faster.

You step back, pull the salt-chalk, and draw a tight closed loop right over the hairline shadow. “No ear, no tongue.”

When you snap your fingers, the filament doesn’t just go slack—it *burns out* in a thin, silent curl, like a hair singed off a candle. A peppery, scorched-ink smell blooms for a second and then dies.

Immediate consequence: the listening line is dead. But it dies loudly in the only way covert things can—by leaving a tell.

Outside, the gloved man’s posture changes. He leans in toward the jamb as if he felt a draft, then raps once—hard—on the wood. “Cute,” he says, voice sharpened. “Add obstruction to the note.”

Below, Bailiff Kettle calls up, “Keywright—move.”

Boots accelerate. The tool-clink comes closer, now distinct: picks, a tension bar, something heavier that could be a small pry.

You grab your coat and travel case and cross to the back window. The latch is shut, but it isn’t *latched right*: the hook sits a hair off its seat, and there’s a faint smear of violet-amber residue on the sill—perfume-ink, the same family as your invitation’s binding scent. Someone has had this window open recently and wiped it down badly.

You ease it up a fraction. Cold salt air pushes in. Outside is the narrow service gap between buildings: a drop to the alley, a drainpipe with two rust-bloomed brackets, and—new—an iron clothesline stretched to the opposite wall with a fresh knot. Not yours.

As you look, a shape shifts in the fog below: a person standing still at the alley mouth, hat brim low, watching the back of your building rather than the front. They don’t call out. They don’t leave. They’re positioned like they’re waiting for you to choose the window.

At the front door, metal touches metal: the keywright has started working the chain. The latch you half-loosened earlier gives a small, betraying click in response.

Threats are now twofold and concrete: forced entry is underway at the front, and a watcher is posted to catch or follow you if you exit via the back.

### Turn 34 [PLAYER]

I dab a fingertip on the violet-amber smear and sniff it, then rub it onto a scrap of paper like a quick field-sample and tuck it into my case.  

I crack the back window a little wider and, staying low, whisper into the fog, “You down there—are you Kettle’s, the keywright’s, or mine?”  

Then I toss my coat out first—just the coat, bundled to look like a body—aiming to snag it on the drainpipe/brackets and make the watcher flinch, while I stay inside and listen for their reaction.

*Agent reasoning: I’m boxed in—front breach imminent, back exit watched. I want to learn who’s waiting and why, but I also need leverage and a way to slip without being grabbed. A decoy plus a quick look at that perfume-ink residue could tell me whose hand is in this.*

### Turn 35 [GAME]

The violet-amber smear comes up tacky on your fingertip. When you sniff it, it hits like expensive grief: violet first, then a warm resin note, then a faint ash bite that dries the back of your throat. It’s not just perfume—there’s binding ink in it, the kind meant to cling to skin oils.

You rub the residue onto a scrap of paper. The paper darkens in a slow bloom, like it’s drinking the scent. You fold it once and slide it into your travel case.

You crack the window wider and whisper into the fog, staying low: “You down there—are you Kettle’s, the keywright’s, or mine?”

The figure at the alley mouth doesn’t answer. Instead, they lift a hand—two fingers to their lips—then point upward, not at you exactly, but at the window line, as if marking your position for someone else. A second later, you hear a soft *clack*—a small mechanism being thumbed, like a pocket lantern shutter or a signaling mirror ring being adjusted.

You bundle your coat and toss it out.

It catches the drainpipe bracket for half a heartbeat, then slips, flops, and drops—hitting the alley stones with a wet-sounding thud that reads like meat in the fog.

The watcher reacts hard: boots scrape back, and you hear the quick inhale of surprise. They move fast toward the “body,” crouching.

Then—too controlled for a random tail—they stop short. “Coat,” they mutter, and you catch the faintest laugh under their breath, like they’re annoyed at themselves for flinching.

Immediately after, a second set of footsteps enters the service gap from the far end—lighter, quicker. Someone else is coming in, drawn by the signal. The first watcher straightens and angles their body to keep the alley mouth covered, not you—like they’re making room for the newcomer to take point.

At your front door, the chain gives a sharp *snap-click*—the weakened latch finally yields under the keywright’s pressure. The door doesn’t swing yet, but it’s no longer secured by the chain; only whatever lock you have beyond it is holding.

Concrete threats now: you’ve confirmed the back watcher is coordinated (they just signaled and got a response), reinforcements are arriving in the service gap, and the front chain is defeated—entry is imminent.

### Turn 36 [PLAYER]

I pull the window down to a narrow crack again and whisper, “All right—message received,” then I quietly slide the travel case under the floorboard gap by my desk and kick the rug back over it.  

At the front door, I call out, “Before you step in—Bailiff Kettle, confirm you have a writ signed by a seated Shadow Court magistrate, not ‘discretion.’ Name the magistrate.”  

While they answer (or don’t), I take my salt-chalk and draw a quick, ugly ward-sigil on the inside of the front threshold—nothing flashy, just enough to sting the first boot that crosses and buy me a heartbeat—then I go back to the rear window and watch the newcomer’s feet in the fog for a telltale uniform or token.

*Agent reasoning: Front entry is imminent and the back exit is watched; I want more intel without committing to either trap, and I should secure/booby-trap sensitive occult material while buying seconds.*

I pull the back window down to a narrow crack again and whisper, “All right—message received,” then I slide my travel case under the floorboard gap by my desk and kick the rug back over it.

At the front door I call, “Before you step in—Bailiff Kettle, confirm you have a writ signed by a seated Shadow Court magistrate, not ‘discretion.’ Name the magistrate.”

While they answer (or don’t), I scratch an ugly little sting-ward on the inside threshold with salt-chalk—quick and mean—then I drift back to the rear window and watch the newcomer’s feet in the fog for a uniform hem or a token glint.

*Agent reasoning: Front entry is imminent and the back alley has coordinated watchers; I want to hide the sensitive case, test Kettle’s legal footing out loud, and set a small threshold sting-ward to buy seconds while I identify who’s outside.*

I pull the back window down to a narrow crack and murmur, “All right—message received,” then slide my travel case into the floorboard gap by the desk and kick the rug back over it.

I call to the front door, “Before you step in—Bailiff Kettle, confirm you have a writ signed by a seated Shadow Court magistrate. Name the magistrate.”

While they stall, I scratch a quick, ugly sting-ward on the inside threshold with salt-chalk, then drift back to the rear window and watch the newcomer’s feet in the fog for a uniform hem or a token glint.

*Agent reasoning: The front entry is about to breach and the back alley has coordinated watchers; I want to hide my case, force Kettle to commit on record, lay a quick sting-ward, and identify the newcomer by any uniform/token.*

### Turn 41 [GAME]

The back window drops to a slit. Fog presses against it like damp felt.

You pry up the loose board by your desk and feed the travel case into the gap. It fits, barely—wood rasps leather, and the case thumps once against whatever’s beneath the floor. Rug back over, scuffed into place.

At the front door, your voice carries.

A pause. Then a man answers close to the wood, amused and careful. “You’ve got the wrong name, Lorne. Kettle doesn’t climb stairs.”

Paper slides under the door—thick, official stock. Not a writ. A notice form, half-folded so you can see the header: **SHADOW COURT BAILIFF SERVICE — INTENT TO CLASSIFY: UNREGISTERED GRIEF**. No magistrate seal visible from this angle; just a blank line where one should be, and a red wax thumbprint that isn’t impressed with a signet—just pressed on, messy.

“I’m here,” the voice continues, “to give you one last chance to make yourself tidy. You withdraw from the vanished-couples inquiry, you sign, you stay registered. You don’t—” a soft tap on the door, right where your chain used to be “—and the city’s allowed to treat you like a loose death.”

While he talks, you crouch and scratch the salt-chalk sigil on the inside threshold. The chalk bites the varnish; the lines go down quick and ugly. The air around it goes faintly metallic, like you’ve just licked a coin.

Back at the rear window, you watch the alley.

The first watcher’s boots are still by your discarded coat. The newcomer arrives into view: narrow shoes, polished toes, no municipal hobnails. Their hem is dark and tailored, the kind that doesn’t brush tenement filth unless it has to. When they step, a small glint swings at knee-height—an enamel token on a short chain, catching lamp-light: a lacquered lantern emblem, black on gold.

They stop beside the first watcher. You hear a low exchange, half-swallowed by fog.

“Is it him?” the newcomer asks.

“Up there. Window line,” the first replies.

At the front door, something scrapes—metal on metal—followed by the quiet click of a tool finding the lock. They’re not waiting for your answer anymore. If that door opens and a boot crosses your threshold, your sting-ward will fire—once.

### Turn 42 [PLAYER]

I snatch the “Intent to Classify” paper, scan for any watermark or hidden ink with a quick breath-warm and tilt to the lamp, then spit, “No seal, no magistrate—tell your boss I don’t sign blank deaths.”

I brace just off the threshold with my chalk in hand, waiting for the first boot—when the sting-ward bites, I use that heartbeat to dart away from the door and slip out the back window, landing light by the drainpipe.

Outside, I keep low in the fog and follow the lantern-token newcomer at a distance, watching their hands and listening for who they report to.

*Agent reasoning: They’re not legit—no seal, wrong bailiff—and the back alley has a lantern-token operative coordinating. I want to learn who’s pulling strings, but I need to survive the breach; the sting-ward buys one beat, so I’ll use it to slip out the back and tail the lantern token rather than get boxed in.*

### Turn 43 [GAME]

You snatch the paper and put it to the lamp. The stock is good—too good for a street bailiff. When you breathe warm across it, a faint watermark blooms: a mourning-lily filigree… but it’s wrong in the way a forged coin is wrong. The lily’s veins resolve into tiny linked pairs—names in microprint, twinned and repeating. The hidden ink isn’t a signature; it’s a ledger-thread.

You tilt it. No magistrate seal. No impressed signet anywhere. Just that smeared red thumbprint and a clerkish serial number that’s been scratched over once and re-inked.

“No seal, no magistrate—” you spit. “—tell your boss I don’t sign blank deaths.”

On the other side of the door, the amused voice drops its warmth. “Pity.”

Metal whispers. The lock gives.

The door cracks open and a boot starts over your threshold.

Your sting-ward bites like a trapped wasp: a sharp *snap* of air and a flash of salt-white sting that crawls up the intruder’s shin. The man jerks back with a choked curse—pain, not incapacitation—stumbling into the hall rail hard enough to rattle it.

But the heartbeat you bought is real.

You’re already moving. You slip to the rear, shoulder through the narrow window gap, and drop to the alley by the drainpipe. Your landing is light—boots kiss wet stone, no slip—though your palm scrapes on the pipe’s rust seam.

In the fog, the lacquer-token newcomer turns at the sound from upstairs. Their head tips, listening. They don’t run; they *signal*—two fingers lifted, a small circular motion.

From the street mouth of the alley, a reply comes: the muted clop of approaching steps, multiple, measured.

The newcomer murmurs to the watcher you saw earlier, close enough for you to catch: “He’s out. Don’t grab—guide.”

They start walking, not away, but *along* the alley line that leads toward Gullhook Row’s main artery—hands visible at their sides, posture deliberately nonthreatening. The enamel token glints once, and when they pass a lamp, you see their other hand is ink-stained at the thumb and forefinger, as if they’ve been handling perfumed paper.

Behind you, above, the front door bangs wider. The man you warded calls down the stairwell, voice sharp now: “Rear! He went rear!”

You can follow the lantern-token at a distance—but the measured steps from the street are closing in to bracket the alley within seconds.

### Turn 44 [PLAYER]

I press flat to the drainpipe in the deepest fog-shadow and let the newcomer and watcher pass, close enough to catch names; if I can, I whisper, “Guide me to who?” under my breath, testing whether either reacts.

Then I climb the drainpipe/brackets up a few feet and swing onto the nearest ledge/overhang—any ugly perch—so the alley sweep misses me, and I watch the street-mouth steps for uniforms, boots, and that lantern emblem.

*Agent reasoning: I’m about to get bracketed; better to misdirect and learn who these lantern-token people are. I’ll eavesdrop close, then slip vertical/sideways into a bolt-hole rather than sprint into the net.*

### Turn 45 [GAME]

You flatten to the drainpipe where the fog pools thickest, cheek against cold iron. The newcomer and the first watcher come past close—close enough you catch the newcomer’s perfume: violet-amber ash, the same wrong-sweet rot as the satchel.

They’re not talking loud, but you get a name.

The watcher mutters, “Lorne slipped your hook, **Mira**.”

So: Mira. Lantern-adjacent, at least by token.

You let the words out—barely a breath: “Guide me to who?”

Mira stops dead.

Not a jump. Not surprise. A clean stop like a dancer hitting a mark. Her head turns slightly toward your drainpipe shadow. She doesn’t look right at you—she looks *past* you, as if checking the air.

Her hand rises, fingers pinched, and she touches the enamel lantern token. It gives a tiny click, like a clasp.

“Wind,” she says softly to the watcher. “He’s here.”

The watcher’s hand goes under his coat.

You don’t wait. You climb—boots finding the drainpipe brackets, hands biting rust. A bracket groans once under your weight; rust flakes into your sleeve. You swing onto a narrow overhang—an ugly little rain-lip above a boarded window. Your knee knocks wood; the board thuds, but holds.

Below, Mira steps back into the alley and lifts her voice toward the street-mouth, controlled and clear: “Rear line. Up. He’s above the second boarded pane.”

So much for missing the sweep.

The steps from the street arrive: four figures, not municipal. No hobnails. Soft-soled shoes and long coats that don’t flap. Two of them wear black gloves; one has a short truncheon tucked like a tool, not a weapon. On the lead one’s lapel, a pin catches the lamplight—black-and-gold lantern enamel, same motif as Mira’s token, but smaller, more discreet.

They don’t rush you. They spread to box the alley: two at the street mouth, one halfway in, Mira nearest your building line. The watcher you first saw keeps his hand under his coat and watches your perch.

Mira tilts her chin up. “Vesper. Don’t make us bleed in public. Come down and be *guided*.”

You are perched above them, exposed if they decide to climb or throw something. They have you located, and they’re coordinating rather than panicking.

I keep my balance on the rain-lip and call down, “Mira—Lantern token, violet-ash paper, and an ‘Intent to Classify’ with no seal. Who exactly are you guiding me to: a magistrate, or a clerk with a thumbprint?”

While I talk, I scrape my salt-chalk along the rusty bracket and the ledge edge, laying a thin slip-line and a little grit-glam—just enough to make the first climber’s hand or boot slide. “No one climbs. No one throws. You want me tidy? Tell me the name at the top of your chain.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m boxed in and they’ve got coordination; I need information and a way out. I’ll talk to stall, probe who “Lantern” serves, and prepare a small distraction/escape using the drainpipe and chalk.*

### Turn 50 [PLAYER]

I steady myself on the rain-lip and call down, “Mira—lantern token, violet-ash paper, and an ‘Intent to Classify’ with no seal. Who exactly are you guiding me to: a magistrate, or a clerk with a thumbprint?”  

As I speak, I drag my salt-chalk along the bracket and ledge edge—thin slip-line, a touch of grit-glam. “No one climbs. No one throws. You want me tidy? Tell me the name at the top of your chain.”

*Agent reasoning: They’ve got me boxed and Mira clocked my position; I need information more than a clean escape, so I’ll interrogate while quietly prepping a deterrent against climbing.*

### Turn 51 [GAME]

Salt-chalk whispers over rust. The line you lay looks like nothing—just a pale scum on iron—but the air around it catches, as if the fog itself is suddenly heavier right at the edge. The rain-lip becomes meaner than it looks.

Your voice carries.

Mira’s eyes flick up again, still not quite meeting yours. At “no seal,” her mouth tightens—annoyance, not confusion. She plants her feet wider, like she’s bracing for a shove that won’t come.

“Cute,” she calls back. “You think we’re Mourning? We buy *space* from Mourning.”

The gloved one with the discreet lantern pin shifts a half-step forward, hands open and visible. Not climbing. Not throwing. Yet.

Mira continues, crisp as a clerk reading a charge: “Top of my chain doesn’t take names from rooftops. But since you’re collecting them—**Magistrate Caul Vey**. Civic side. He likes his problems folded and handed back.”

One of the men at the street-mouth turns his head sharply at that, like Mira’s said more than she was meant to. He murmurs, low: “Mira—”

She cuts him off without looking away from you. “He asked. I answered.”

Then she lifts her token again and clicks it twice.

From somewhere above and behind you—on the same building line, higher than your rain-lip—there’s a soft scrape: shoe on wet slate. A second later, a thin cord drops into view, weighted with something small and dark. It swings once, then steadies, like whoever’s holding it has done this before.

Not a thrown weapon. A loop. A snare.

The cord lowers toward your perch, aiming to catch your wrist or hook around your ankle if you move wrong. The person holding it stays out of sight on the roofline, but their position is clear: they’re directly above your escape route back up.

Below, the halfway-in bailiff (the one without gloves) tests the wall with his palm—careful. His hand hits your chalked bracket and skates a fraction. He freezes, then pulls back and wipes his palm on his coat, eyes narrowing.

Mira’s voice flattens. “Vesper. Last clean offer. Come down on your own feet. Or you come down with rope-burn.”

No one climbs. No one throws. But you are now boxed: four in the alley, and one unseen above with a lowering snare.

### Turn 52 [PLAYER]

I shift my weight so the snare has to choose between my wrist and empty air, and I flick my chalk up at the dangling cord—trying to dust it with a quick tack-sting sigil. “Magistrate Caul Vey… civic side doesn’t send alley lanterns unless they’re laundering the paperwork.”

I keep my eyes on the roofline and call down to Mira, voice tight. “Tell Vey I’ll come tidy when I see a real seal and a real charge—until then, you’re just a clerk with muscle. Who’s holding the rope? Give me their name, and I’ll consider your ‘clean offer.’”

*Agent reasoning: I’m curious about Caul Vey and why they’re using a snare instead of knives; I need to buy time and test the rope-handler while setting up an exit. A small mistake: I’ll talk too long, risking the snare getting closer.*

### Turn 53 [GAME]

Your shift buys you a heartbeat: the loop dips where your wrist *was*, kisses empty air, then swings back—searching.

You snap your chalk upward. The dust catches the wet cord and sticks in a thin, pale rash. For a moment nothing—then the tack-sting sigil bites. The rope fibers tense like a muscle cramping. The loop jerks hard, not toward you but *up*, as if it’s trying to recoil away from your mark.

Whoever’s holding it doesn’t let go. They haul—fast.

The cord slices up over the rain-lip and goes taut with a sharp *thrum* that vibrates through the bracket you’ve chalked. Your slip-line does what you paid it to do: the sudden pull makes the cord skid against the gritty edge instead of gripping cleanly. You hear a muffled curse from above, close and breathy.

But the recoil has a cost. The cord’s weighted end whips back down once, uncontrolled, and clips your forearm—more sting than impact—leaving a wet burn where the chalk dust has mixed with saltwater.

Below, Mira’s posture changes. She doesn’t look up anymore; she looks at the men around her and makes a two-finger sign—tight, impatient.

The gloved one with the lantern pin steps forward and produces something flat from inside his coat: a folded document board, wax-smeared at one corner. He holds it up where you can see it, but not close enough to read. The wax isn’t a seal—just a smear, like someone pressed a stamp and pulled away halfway.

Mira calls up, “You want names? Fine. Rope’s **Harrow**.” A beat. “You want *real* seal? You get it from Vey in person. That’s the point.”

Above you, Harrow shifts position. You don’t see him, but you hear slate grit and a knee scrape—he’s moving laterally, trying to get a better angle that avoids your chalked edge.

And down in the alley, the ungloved bailiff stops testing the wall and instead reaches into his pocket. The metallic click that follows is unmistakable: a spring-knife being thumbed open.

Mira keeps her eyes on you. “Last time: down. Now. Before Harrow decides you’re easier to drag than to talk to.”

### Turn 54 [PLAYER]

I hiss through my teeth at the burn, then call down, “Harrow. Good—now I know who to curse by name if you slip that loop again.”

I flick a pinch of salt-chalk dust up toward the roofline to fog Harrow’s angle, then edge along the rain-lip toward the nearest corner where I can drop to a lower awning instead of the alley floor. “Mira, hold your knife-dog. Have Lantern-pin step forward—alone—and *raise the board close enough for me to read the heading*. You get five seconds of stillness, or I start making this wall slick for everyone.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re escalating—rope above, knife below—so I need to buy time and change the geometry. I’m curious about Harrow and that fake seal, but I can’t get cornered on a rain-lip; I’ll force a parley by creating a distraction and moving to a better perch while demanding to read the document up close.*

### Turn 55 [GAME]

The salt-chalk pinch goes up in a pale burst. It doesn’t “fog” so much as *sparkle* in the wet air—grit catching gaslight—and Harrow’s next adjustment hesitates. You hear him inhale, then cough once, sharp, like he caught chalk in his teeth.

But the wind off the sea takes most of it. Whatever angle you stole, it’s brief.

You edge along the rain-lip toward the corner. The brick there is darker, slick with runoff. Below that corner is what you were aiming for: a canvas awning over a shuttered fishmonger’s side door—low enough to drop to, high enough to keep you out of immediate knife range. The canvas is rain-sagged; the supporting struts look old.

Mira doesn’t shout. She just lifts her hand and *closes it*.

The knife-dog (ungloved) doesn’t rush the wall—he can’t—but he does step back and sets his feet, eyes tracking your corner like he’s measuring where you’ll land. Knife stays open at his side.

The lantern-pin man moves—alone, as ordered—two careful paces forward into the middle of the alley mouth. He raises the board higher and closer, angling it to catch lampglow.

You can make out the heading now, block letters:

**INTENT TO CLASSIFY — UNREGISTERED GRIEF (PROVISIONAL)**

Beneath it, smaller: **Filed under Magistrate Caul Vey’s authority**. There’s a space where a seal should be—only that half-smeared wax bruise you saw before.

Mira calls up, “Five seconds. Don’t waste them.”

Above, Harrow stops coughing. The rope comes back down—not as a loop this time, but straight, weighted end first, dropping toward the *awning* line rather than your wrist. He’s aiming to hook the canvas or its strut so he can yank it when you commit to the drop.

You’re at the corner now. One clean step and you can drop to the awning—but Harrow’s weight is about to turn that awning into a trapdoor if he catches it.

### Turn 56 [PLAYER]

I snap, “Unregistered Grief—provisional? That’s not a charge, that’s a fishing license,” and I fling a thicker chalk-salt smear straight at the weighted end of Harrow’s rope, trying to make it bite-sticky and jerk in his hand.  

Then I pull back from the awning edge and crab-walk along the rain-lip the other way, eyes up, looking for a drainpipe or window latch to drop by instead. “Mira—what *exactly* is being classified as ‘grief’ here, and whose name is on the original complaint?”

*Agent reasoning: The heading is useful, but the awning drop is now a trap if Harrow hooks it. I want to keep exploring for leverage—use the “Unregistered Grief” angle, disable the rope, and find a safer descent while pressing Mira for details.*

### Turn 58 [PLAYER]

I freeze on the rain-lip and scan both directions for a drainpipe, window latch, or any ledge that isn’t under Harrow’s rope. “Hold—nothing’s moved on my end. What do I see right now: where’s Harrow’s rope, where are Mira and the lantern-pin, and is there a safe drop point?”  

Then I call down anyway, voice hard: “Mira—answer it clean. What’s being ‘classified’ as grief, and whose name is on the original complaint?”

*Agent reasoning: I’ve got no new scene text, so I’ll push for clarification and keep Vesper cautious—reposition away from the awning trap while demanding the missing details that matter: complainant, alleged “grief,” and the legal authority.*

### Turn 59 [GAME]

You hold still on the rain-lip. Water runs off the gutter edge in a steady thread, tapping the brick below like a metronome.

**What you see, right now:**

- **Harrow’s rope:** It’s no longer swinging for your wrist. The weighted end hangs about a body-length out from the wall, drifting slightly in the wind—then it lifts, controlled, as Harrow draws it back up. The line scrapes the roof edge once, a gritty hiss. You don’t see Harrow, but you can track his position by the rope’s angle: he’s moved a few feet to your left, trying to get above your new line.

- **Mira:** Still at the alley mouth, shoulders squared, one hand raised in that tight “hold” fist. She’s watching you like a ledger entry that might start bleeding.

- **Lantern-pin:** Two paces in front of her, board still up. He doesn’t advance further. His free hand stays visible and empty, fingers spread slightly to show compliance.

- **Safe drop points:**  
  - To your **right**, three windows down: a rusted **drainpipe** runs from the roofline to the street. The brackets look intact, but the pipe itself is salt-bloomed and dented—climbable, not trustworthy.  
  - Below you **immediately**, the **awning** you’d clocked is still there—rain-sagged, and now clearly within Harrow’s rope reach if he wants it.  
  - To your **left**, there’s a narrow **stone cornice/ledge** about a foot below the rain-lip that runs to a boarded window. It’s slick, but it’s not under the rope’s current hang.

You call down your question.

Mira answers—clean, but not kind. “**Grief is being classified as unregistered practice**. Meaning: you’ve been *handling* it without a permit that exists in the book.”

She nods at the board. “**Original complaint** was filed as ‘concern for public decency’—and the name on it is **Caul Vey**. Not a citizen. Not a victim. The Magistrate.”

As she speaks, the rope goes taut for a second—Harrow testing distance. The weighted end rises, then steadies, like he’s ready to drop it again the moment you commit to any descent point.

### Turn 60 [PLAYER]

I mutter, “A magistrate filing his own decency complaint—how quaint,” then ease down onto the slick stone cornice to my left and start sidling toward the boarded window, keeping my shoulders tight to the wall and my eyes on the rope’s angle.

I call down, “Mira—if Vey’s the complainant, this isn’t enforcement, it’s acquisition. Tell me what he thinks I’m *holding*—name the grief, or I walk away and you explain the missing seal to him.”

*Agent reasoning: Vey filing his own complaint smells like a setup; I want more info, but I also need a descent point Harrow can’t easily foul. The left cornice gives me lateral movement and a chance to reach that boarded window hardware.*

### Turn 61 [GAME]

Your boots find the cornice with a wet, careful kiss. Stone—slick as fish skin. You get your weight over it, shoulders pressed to brick, and start to sidle left.

The rope answers immediately.

The weighted end drops—fast—aimed not at your hands, but at the **space just ahead of your feet**, a pendulum meant to make you flinch off the ledge. It clips the wall with a dull *thunk*, showering grit and a few flakes of mortar. Not a hit, but close enough to tell you Harrow’s recalculated.

Mira’s fist loosens. She tips her chin up, eyes narrowed, and you can see her making a decision about how much truth costs.

“Acquisition,” she repeats, like she’s tasting the word. Then, louder so Harrow and the lantern-pin hear it too: “He thinks you’re holding **a romance ledger entry that isn’t his**.”

The lantern-pin man shifts—just a half-step—board still raised. His voice finally shows through, thin and bureaucratic. “Investigative materials recovered from sealed sites constitute—”

Mira cuts him off with a look, then keeps talking to you. “Not a name. A *pairing*. Two missing couples’ registry-lines that were supposed to be ash by now. That’s what he thinks you’ve got, Vesper. That’s why the seal’s wrong—this notice wasn’t meant to be filed. It was meant to be *effective*.”

Above, the rope snaps tight again, not dropped this time—**hauled**. The weighted end skitters along the roof edge and disappears upward. Harrow’s repositioning for something else.

You reach the boarded window. The boards are old pine, nailed in a hurry long ago. One nail head is bright—newer. Whoever boarded it last time did it *recently*, and didn’t bother matching the hardware.

From the alley, the knife-dog (ungloved) stops measuring and moves: he backs toward the wall under you, eyes up, knife still down but ready. He’s getting into a spot where, if you drop, you drop near him.

Mira calls up, quieter now, a warning disguised as an instruction: “Don’t ‘walk away.’ Vey doesn’t let go. He *relabels*.”

And somewhere above-left, you hear it: a soft scrape of boot on gravel—Harrow is now **directly over the boarded window line**, rope unseen for the moment, which is worse than seeing it.

### Turn 62 [PLAYER]

I press flat to the brick, then slide my chalk blade out and start worrying at the *new* nail head—quiet, testing if the board will give without a full pry.  

I call down, keeping my voice even, “A pairing, huh? Mira—tell Vey he’s welcome to buy my ‘grief’ like anyone else: with a real seal and real terms. Knife-dog—take two steps back unless you want to be my witness when you slip.”  

Then I glance up toward the roofline, “Harrow—if you’re above this window, say so. I don’t like surprises, and you don’t like what I do when I’m startled.”

*Agent reasoning: The boarded window looks like a potential escape route, and the newer nail suggests recent access. Harrow repositioning above it makes it dangerous, but it’s also my best lead—why board it now? I’ll probe the window while keeping Harrow talking and try to control the knife-dog’s position with misdirection.*

### Turn 63 [GAME]

The chalk blade finds the newer nail head. You work it slow, shaving at the edge where fresh metal meets damp pine. It gives—barely—a millimeter of lift, enough to whisper that the nail wasn’t driven deep. Whoever sealed this didn’t expect anyone to come back from the outside.

Below, Mira doesn’t look away from you. “Terms,” she repeats, and there’s a sharp, tired humor in it. “Vey doesn’t buy. He inventories.”

The lantern-pin man—knife-dog’s partner, really—keeps his board up and says, “This is an active decency action. Negotiation is—”

Knife-dog actually does what you say: he takes **one** step back, not two, eyes still on your boots. He’s staying just out of an easy drop-kick range while keeping you boxed between wall and fall.

From above, Harrow answers you—not with words, but with a **sound**: rope sliding over stone, controlled, measured. Then his voice, close to the roof edge, calm as stamped paper. “I’m above the window.”

A heartbeat later, the rope’s weighted end drops into view—**not** swinging at your feet this time. It drops straight down beside your shoulder and hangs there, almost gentle, like an offered hand.

Then it tightens.

The line jerks sideways, trying to **snare your forearm and pin it to the wall**—a restraint move, meant to trap the arm holding the blade and stop you from prying. The weight bumps your elbow hard; your chalk blade skitters, still in your grip but jarred.

At the same moment, the boarded window shifts: your earlier lift on the nail makes the board **creak and flex**, and a thin seam opens between board and frame—just enough for a **breath of air** to leak out.

It doesn’t smell like dust.

It smells like **violet-amber ash**—the same perfumed binding-ink note that’s been stalking your paperwork—stronger, fresher, like someone used it in there recently.

Mira’s head snaps toward the window seam. For the first time, her composure breaks a notch. “Vesper—don’t breathe that in.”

Knife-dog hears it too. He looks up at the seam, then at Mira, and his knife hand rises an inch—uncertain whether his orders are “contain” or “retrieve.”

Right now the threat is immediate and physical: Harrow’s rope is actively trying to bind your arm against the wall, and the window is venting binding-scented air through the gap you’ve opened.

### Turn 64 [PLAYER]

I clamp my sleeve over my mouth and nose and twist my trapped forearm hard into the rope to take the bite out of it, grinding salt-chalk dust from my cuff into the fibers. “Mira—*what is that ink doing in there?*”  

Without looking down, I rasp, “Harrow, easy—if I go off this ledge you’re explaining a broken investigator to your magistrate,” and I kick my heel against the board near the loosened nail, trying to pop the seam wider for a quick look while I keep my face turned away from the vent.

*Agent reasoning: I’m curious about what’s inside, but the binding-ink scent is an immediate hazard; I need to stop breathing it and get Harrow’s rope off my arm without losing my grip or footing. I’ll use salt-chalk as a quick counter and try to widen the seam just enough to peek, not inhale.*

### Turn 66 [PLAYER]

I keep my sleeve clamped over my mouth and nose and grind my cuff’s salt-chalk into the rope, twisting my forearm to slack it. “Mira—what is that violet-amber ink doing in there?”

“Harrow, ease up—if I go off this ledge, you’re the one handing Vey a broken investigator.” I hook my heel under the loosened board edge and give it a sharp kick to widen the seam just enough for a fast sideways glance, keeping my face turned away from the vent.

*Agent reasoning: I need to avoid inhaling that binding-ink, free my arm from the rope before I lose balance, and get a peek inside the window without committing to a full breach.*

### Turn 67 [GAME]

Your sleeve seals over your mouth and nose; the fabric goes damp fast in the fog. You twist your forearm into the rope and grind your cuff hard—salt-chalk rasping into the fibers.

It works, partially.

The rope doesn’t “burn” like a warded cord would; it’s just rope, but it’s been waxed. The chalk fouls the wax and the line **slips a fraction**. Enough slack to keep your forearm from being pinned flush to the brick—enough that you can move, but not enough to get free. The weight still knocks against your wrist like a metronome.

Above, Harrow’s voice comes again, strained by effort. “Don’t dramatize, Lorne.” But the line **eases** a hair—his pull becomes control rather than yank. He’s listening, if only because paperwork hates obvious injuries.

Mira answers your question without looking at the lantern-pin man. “That’s not ink in there. That’s *set.* Binding medium. You let it air and it looks for lungs and lies.”

You hook your heel under the loosened board edge and kick.

The board pops with a dry crack; the loosened nail **tears free** with a squeal. The seam opens to two fingers’ width, and a **visible ribbon of perfumed vapor** curls out—lazy, searching—before the fog tears it apart.

You keep your face turned away and take a fast sideways glance.

Inside is not your office.

It’s a narrow, lightless service cavity behind the wall—like someone built a false back. You see: a shallow shelf, a coil of dock-twine, and a **small ceramic inkwell** tipped on its side, its mouth smeared with violet-amber residue. Next to it, pressed into the wood as if stamped, is the **lovers’ sigil**—fresh, wet-looking despite the dark.

And something else: a **thin wire** stretched across the cavity at ankle height, tied to the board you just kicked. The board’s movement pulls it taut.

You feel it in your boot through the wood: a tiny *click*—not loud, but decisive.

Below, knife-dog’s uncertainty resolves into action. He lunges toward the wall, reaching up—not for you, but for the board gap, like he’s been told to secure whatever’s inside before you do.

Mira’s hand flashes out and catches his wrist. “No,” she snaps, and for the first time her voice carries command, not negotiation.

The threat is immediate and concrete: the wire you tripped has just actuated something **inside the false cavity**—and you don’t yet know if it’s an alarm, a trap, or a release valve for more of that binding vapor.

### Turn 68 [PLAYER]

“Everyone hold—nobody touches that gap.”

I keep my sleeve over my face, then jab the chalk blade into the seam to pin the board back toward closed and kill the airflow; with my free fingers I feel for that thin wire and try to nick it clean. “Harrow—give me slack, now, or you’re the one tripping whatever I just woke up.”

*Agent reasoning: The click suggests a trap or release; I need to stop airflow and inspect quickly without inhaling, while also keeping Mira from losing control and preventing the knife-dog from grabbing evidence. I’ll try to jam the board back, cut the trip wire if I can, and get Harrow to slack the rope so I can work.*

### Turn 69 [GAME]

“Nobody touches that gap,” you rasp through cloth.

Knife-dog freezes mid-reach like he’s been slapped by a rule he recognizes. The lantern-pin man doesn’t freeze—he takes a half-step sideways to get a better angle up at you, eyes narrowing, already calculating how to report this.

You jam the chalk blade into the seam and lever the board inward. The gap narrows; the perfumed ribbon of vapor thins to almost nothing. The smell doesn’t vanish, but it stops *pouring*.

Your free fingers find the wire—cold, thin, under tension. It’s not fishing line. It’s metal filament, the kind used in cheap trip-snares.

You start to nick it.

The moment the filament’s tension shifts, something inside the false cavity answers: a second, quieter *click*, followed by a soft, wet **glug**—like a stopper pulled from a bottle.

Even with the board mostly pinned shut, the cavity exhales again, harder this time. The vapor doesn’t just drift; it **pressurizes** and jets through the remaining hairline seam, trying to find the easiest path. It hits your sleeve and shoulder first, soaking the cloth with that violet-amber reek.

Mira’s eyes widen. “Vesper—stop cutting it. It’s a siphon.”

Above you, Harrow swears under his breath. The rope slackens noticeably—enough that your trapped forearm can bend without the weight hammering your wrist. “Slack,” he spits, as if the word tastes bad. “Don’t—move—fast.”

But the mechanism you woke up doesn’t care about Harrow.

Inside the cavity, you hear something skitter—ceramic scraping wood—then a brittle **crack** as the tipped inkwell shifts and breaks against the shelf edge. The binding medium starts to leak in earnest.

Below, knife-dog yanks his wrist back from Mira and backs off two steps, suddenly pale. “That’s Lantern stink,” he mutters, like it’s an accusation.

The threat is now clear and immediate: the trip-filament is tied to a **pressurized release** inside the false wall. Cutting it mid-tension has opened a siphon, and the cavity is actively venting binding vapor and leaking medium behind the board—meaning the longer it runs, the more it will saturate the wood, your sleeve, and the air around you.

### Turn 70 [PLAYER]

I stop nicking the filament immediately and shove the board fully closed with the chalk blade as a wedge, then press my palm flat over the seam through my sleeve to seal it. “Mira—Lantern stink means what, exactly? And how do I choke a siphon without breathing it?”  

I glance up, tight-voiced, “Harrow—hold that slack and anchor me; if I have to drop, I’m dropping on purpose, not because your rope twitched.”

*Agent reasoning: The siphon is venting binding vapor; cutting the wire worsened it. I need to stop airflow fast, avoid inhalation, and learn what “Lantern” implies from Mira/knife-dog while I still have leverage over Harrow’s rope.*

### Turn 71 [GAME]

You stop cutting. The filament keeps its tension, humming faintly under your fingertip.

You shove the board fully shut with the chalk blade and wedge it. Wood complains; the seam compresses to nearly nothing. When you press your palm flat over it through your sleeve, the airflow drops from a jet to a spiteful, intermittent hiss—like a kettle trying to breathe through a pinhole. The perfume still seeps, but slower, and it’s mostly trapped against your sleeve and the wall.

Consequence: your sleeve is now **saturated**. The cloth clings to your skin, damp and cold, and the violet-amber stink is strong enough you taste it through your teeth even without inhaling.

Mira keeps her face turned away, speaking fast. “Lantern stink means *pairing medium.* It doesn’t just bind skin-to-skin—” She swallows, eyes flicking to Harrow and then to the lantern-pin man. “—it binds *story.* It makes you decide you’ve always wanted what it wants.”

Knife-dog’s voice comes small now. “It gets in your head. Makes you—” he stops, jaw working, refusing to say the rest.

“How do I choke a siphon without breathing it?” you ask.

Mira answers with what she can, not what you want. “You don’t *choke* it from this side. You cap the source or you drown it. Water cuts the perfume—saltwater best. But if it’s pressurized, it’ll keep pushing until the reservoir’s empty or the line breaks somewhere else.”

Above, Harrow shifts his stance; you feel the rope go from “held” to **anchored**—he’s braced it around something solid up there, taking the twitch out of it. “You’ve got slack,” he calls down, voice clipped. “You drop, you call it. I’m not catching surprises.”

The lantern-pin man takes out a small paper slip and a stub of pencil, shielding it from fog with his body. He starts writing anyway, eyes never leaving your wedged board. “This is municipal property,” he says, calm as a coffin. “You’re sealing evidence.”

Mira snaps back, “You’re *watching* evidence vent into a tenement.”

The immediate threat is now twofold and concrete:
1) The siphon is still **actively pressurizing** against your seal; if the wedge shifts or your hand slips, it will vent a stronger burst directly into the stairwell air.
2) Your sleeve and palm are contaminated; if you lower your guard and breathe normally, you risk inhaling enough pairing medium to start **memory-skips and compulsions**—and the lantern-pin clerk is already preparing to turn this into a charge.

“Clerk—write this too: you were warned it’s venting into a tenement, and you chose ink over containment.”

“Mira, get me saltwater—bucket, bottle, anything—now. Knife-dog, run if you’ve got sense.” I keep my sleeve sealed to the seam, then slide my chalk blade’s edge to scratch a quick salt-sigil on the board face around the nail holes, trying to make the wood drink the medium instead of breathing it out.

Up to the roofline: “Harrow—haul me up a foot. I want to see if there’s another board or vent higher I can cap from above without opening this.”

*Agent reasoning: The siphon’s still pushing and my sleeve’s contaminated; I need saltwater fast and to keep the gap sealed while I learn where the reservoir is. Also the clerk writing is a problem—distract or enlist him as witness.*

### Turn 74 [PLAYER]

I freeze with my sleeve still sealed to the seam, listening hard. “Mira—talk to me. Harrow—status on the line. Did something just go dark, or did I?”

### Turn 75 [GAME]

Your sleeve stays pressed to the seam. The hiss behind your palm thins to a faint, steady **tick-tick**—pressure bleeding through whatever hairline gap remains.

Nothing “goes dark” in your eyes. The gaslamp glow is still there, bruised and smeared by fog. What changes is sound: the stairwell’s usual drip and distant radio-prayer feel suddenly far away, as if someone shut a door between you and the building.

“Mira—talk to me.”

No answer.

You turn your head as much as you can without breaking the seal. Mira is still on the stairs below—but she’s gone rigid, chin slightly lifted like she’s listening for a name in a crowd. Her hand, the one that held the lantern hook, has loosened. The hook hangs from two fingers, swaying.

“Harrow—status on the line.”

Up above: rope creaks against brick. Harrow’s silhouette shifts. “Line’s good,” he calls down immediately. “You didn’t black out. You’re still with me.” Then, sharper: “Don’t breathe deep. Your sleeve’s soaked.”

Knife-dog isn’t running. He’s staring at Mira with an expression that’s half hunger, half panic—like he recognizes her as an answer to a question he never asked. He takes one involuntary step toward her.

The lantern-pin clerk has stopped writing. His pencil hovers. He’s looking at Mira too, and his mouth is slightly open, as if he’s about to speak a familiar pet name and can’t remember whose it belongs to.

You feel it in your own body—not a swoon, not a spell-circle snapping shut, but a **pull**: a thought trying to form around the idea that this moment has always been leading to a particular pairing. It’s not fully in you yet, but it’s at the edge, testing the seams.

Behind your palm, the siphon gives a single stronger **puff**, like it found a new path. The board shifts a hair against your chalk wedge—still closed, but the pressure is actively working it.

Threat, immediate and concrete: the medium is now affecting the people below you first. Mira is on the cusp of a compulsion state; knife-dog and the clerk are being drawn toward her. If anyone touches anyone else while this is in the air, the binding can “take” faster—and if your seal slips, the next vent will hit the whole stairwell.

### Turn 76 [PLAYER]

“Eyes off her. Hands to yourselves—now.” I bark down the stairwell, voice tight through cloth. “Knife-dog, back down three steps and sit. Clerk, turn around and cover your mouth before you ‘remember’ something that’ll ruin your life.”

Without lifting my palm from the seam, I snap at Harrow, “Haul them up—Mira first, by the hook if you have to. Keep them separated. Nobody touches anybody.”

Then, softer but sharp, to Mira: “Mira—name five things you can see. Out loud. Stay with me.”

*Agent reasoning: The pairing medium is hitting Mira and the others; I need to stop contact immediately and get them out of the plume while keeping the seam sealed. I can use authority and threat, and ask Harrow to pull them up/out or at least keep distance.*

### Turn 77 [GAME]

Your bark cracks through the stairwell like a slap.

Knife-dog flinches hard—like you yanked him by the collar. He stumbles backward three steps, overdoes it, and sits down on the edge of a stair with his hands clamped between his knees. His eyes keep trying to slide back to Mira anyway, but he forces them to the floorboards. “I’m— I’m sitting. I’m sitting,” he repeats, breath fast.

The clerk hesitates half a beat too long. Then whatever professional composure he had loses a tooth: he turns his back to Mira and the stairwell, shoulders hunched, and pulls his coat sleeve up over his mouth and nose. His pencil drops and clatters down two steps. “This is— this is highly irregular,” he muffles into wool, but he doesn’t turn back.

Harrow answers with action, not words. The rope jerks—tightens—then starts moving with measured pulls. You hear brick grit as it runs over the parapet above.

“Mira—name five things you can see.”

Mira blinks like she’s waking up underwater. Her lips part; no sound at first. Then, on the second try, she speaks—flat, forced, anchoring herself one object at a time.

“Rail. Rust… on the rail.” Swallow. “Your… sleeve. Chalk. The— the clerk’s pin. Knife-dog’s boots.”

The rope goes taut again. Harrow has hooked it down—using the lantern hook as an ugly improvised lift point. Mira’s fingers clamp reflexively around the hook as it pulls. It bites into her grip; she gasps, pain punching through the haze. Good: pain is reality. Bad: her body is now moving toward you, up the stairwell, through air that’s still contaminated.

“Nobody touches anybody,” Harrow calls down, voice strained with the haul. “I’ve got her. Keep your seal.”

As Mira rises, the siphon behind your palm gives another insistent **puff**. The board shudders against your wedge. Your chalk-sigil around the nail holes smears where your forearm brushes it—still there, but imperfect.

Concrete threat: Mira is being lifted through the affected air toward the roofline. If the board shifts further, the next vent will hit her full in the face on the way up; if she coughs or panics, she’ll inhale deeper. The clerk and knife-dog are contained for the moment, but both are still in the medium’s reach—one lapse, one touch, and the binding accelerates.

### Turn 78 [PLAYER]

“Harrow—stop her just below me. Keep her there, breathing shallow into her sleeve; don’t let her drift past this seam.”

Keeping my palm sealed, I shrug my coat off one shoulder and flick it down between Mira and the wall like a curtain. “Mira—wrap your sleeve over nose and mouth. Two more: name your mother’s name and the last meal you ate.”

To the clerk, still turned: “You. Without turning around—do you have a canteen, flask, anything with liquid? Roll it up the stairs. Salt if you’ve got it.”

Then I press my ear to the board, voice low and surgical: “Listen, siphon—where’s your reservoir? Mira, when you’re steady, tell me: is pairing medium usually jarred, bladdered, or piped?”

*Agent reasoning: Mira’s passing right by the seam—if it vents again she’ll take it full force. I need a quick physical baffle without breaking the seal, and I want more info about the source/reservoir to end this instead of just holding it.*

### Turn 79 [GAME]

Harrow checks the rope immediately. The line stops with a hard, controlled hitch; Mira hangs just below your level, boots scraping the brick as she tries to find purchase. “Holding,” Harrow grunts. “She’s not coming past you.”

You shrug your coat free and snap it down. It lands between Mira and the wall in a heavy fold—an improvised curtain that blocks line-of-sight and catches some of the draft. It doesn’t stop the air itself, but it breaks the “seeing” part of whatever’s trying to form.

“Mira—wrap your sleeve—”

She fumbles, then obeys. Sleeve over nose and mouth. Her breathing goes shallow, ragged but controlled.

“Mother’s name,” you prompt.

“E-Esme,” she says into cloth. “Esme Rook.”

“Last meal.”

“Pickled herring… and bread. Cold.” The answer comes quicker. Her eyes focus on your coat like it’s an instruction sheet.

The clerk, still facing away, pats his vest with one hand, then his coat. “I have water—work issue,” he says, voice pinched. He crouches, sets something metal on the step, and **rolls** it up the stairs without turning. It bumps twice, then comes to rest a step below Mira’s dangling boots: a dented, municipal canteen stamped with the Mourning Office seal. “No salt,” he adds. “Not on my person.”

You press your ear to the board.

Behind it, the siphon isn’t a voice—it's infrastructure. You hear a **wet, periodic draw**, like a bellows pulling through a narrow throat, then the faintest slosh answering it. The reservoir isn’t right behind the board; it’s *lower*, feeding upward. Each draw is followed by that thin pressure tick you felt earlier.

As you listen, the board shifts another fraction against your wedge. Not open—yet—but the seam **breathes**. A cold, perfumed exhale threads out and hits your cheekbone where your seal isn’t perfect.

Immediate consequence: your eyes sting and your throat tightens with the reflex to inhale deeper.

Mira, muffled, manages: “If it’s the… Lantern blend? It’s usually… bladdered. Pig bladder or gut-skin. Easy to hide under clothes, under seats. Piped is… municipal. Too loud. Too traceable.”

Harrow swears under his breath. “Vesper—your wedge is walking.”

Threat, clear and present: the feed is coming from below (a hidden bladder or line), and the seam is starting to leak around your ear/cheek. If the board gives any more, the next puff will vent directly into your face and down onto Mira’s position—she’ll take it full, and the clerk and knife-dog will catch the drift a heartbeat later.

### Turn 80 [PLAYER]

I pinch my nose and mouth into my sleeve and turn my face away from the seam, blinking hard. “Harrow—hold. Mira, don’t breathe deep—eyes on my coat, not the wall.”

I hook my boot and drag the canteen up, then—without breaking my palm-seal—I crack it and splash water along the seam and into the nail holes over my chalk-sigil, trying to make a wet, swollen gasket. “Clerk—keep facing away. Knife-dog, stay seated.”

Then I rasp to Harrow, “I need a knife tip or something thin—can you lower me a blade or hook so I can probe under the board and find where it’s feeding from below without opening it?”

*Agent reasoning: The wedge is failing and the medium is already leaking into my face; I need to reduce pressure fast and create a proper wet seal using the canteen, while keeping Mira from inhaling and everyone separated. Curiosity pushes me to confirm the reservoir’s location, but survival comes first.*

### Turn 81 [GAME]

You turn your face into your sleeve and blink the sting out. The perfume still finds you—thin, needling—but you’re not gulping it.

“Harrow—hold.”

The rope stays locked. Mira hangs where she is, feet braced against brick now, staring at the draped coat like it’s a lifeline. She nods once, small, and keeps her breaths shallow into her sleeve.

You snag the canteen with your boot and drag it up, metal scraping stone. With your free hand you work the cap. It resists—then gives with a sharp twist. Water slaps out in a sloppy sheet onto the seam and runs down into the nail holes, darkening the chalk-sigil to gray paste.

For a moment the board’s “breathing” changes: the **tick-tick** becomes a dampened **thup**, like the pressure has to push through wet fibers now. The seam swells slightly where the wood drinks.

Then the downside hits. The perfumed medium catches in the wet and starts to **foam** at the edge—tiny pearled bubbles that cling instead of dissipating. The smell intensifies, sweeter and more intimate, because it’s no longer just air; it’s a film.

Below, the clerk stays faced away, rigid. Knife-dog remains seated, but he begins rocking subtly, heel tapping the stair as if keeping time with a song only he can hear. He does not stand.

You rasp for a thin blade.

Harrow shifts above; rope creaks. “I’ve got a hook and a penknife,” he calls. “Penknife’s on my belt—can’t drop it clean without losing it. Hook I can lower.”

A second later, something metal scrapes at the parapet. The lantern hook descends on the line, swinging slightly. It’s not a knife tip—more like a blunt, curved beak. Usable for prying or snagging, not for delicate probing.

As it comes down, the wet seam gives a sudden **spit**—a single bead of black-violet fluid pushes out from one nail hole and slides down your watered chalk, leaving an inky comet trail.

Threat, immediate: your “gasket” is holding back open venting, but it’s concentrating the binding medium into a sticky film that can transfer by touch. If that hook (or your fingers) picks up the foamed residue and then contacts Mira, rope, or your own skin, you risk spreading the compulsion instead of containing it. Also, the feed is still pressurizing from below; the board is still trying to walk.

### Turn 82 [PLAYER]

“Harrow—hold that hook steady in midair; do not let it touch the seam or the rope above my hands. Mira, stay braced and keep your eyes on the coat—no reaching.”

I fish a scrap of chalk from my pocket and, keeping my sealing palm planted, I flick a quick ring-mark on the stair just under the foaming drip line. “Clerk—still facing away: tell me if you smell anything sweetening. Knife-dog, count your breaths out loud—slow.”

Then I use the dangling hook like a long finger, reaching *under* the board from the bottom edge to snag or feel for anything taut—bladder, tube, twine—without prying the face open. “If I catch a line, Harrow, you yank up hard on my count; we sever the feed by ripping it free, not by opening the vent.”

*Agent reasoning: The seam’s turned into a transfer hazard; I need to stop pressure from below and avoid contaminating the hook/rope/Mira. I’ll use the hook at a distance to test for a feed line under the board, and I’ll try to “mark” the foam so we can see if it’s spreading while keeping everyone separated.*

### Turn 83 [GAME]

Harrow steadies the hook midair like he’s holding a scalpel over a sleeping vein. “Steady,” he answers, voice tight. The hook stops swinging.

Mira keeps her eyes on the fallen coat and braces her boots harder into the brick. Her knuckles go white on the lantern hook she’s already gripping, but she doesn’t reach for anything else.

You scratch a quick ring-mark on the stair under the drip line—chalk biting damp stone. The foamed bead above it swells, hesitates, then drops. It lands inside your ring with a soft, wet *pat* and sits there, trembling like a living blister.

“Clerk,” you call.

Still facing away, he swallows audibly. “Yes. I—” He pauses, then his voice goes thin. “It’s… stronger. Sweeter. Like violets in a warm room.”

Knife-dog starts counting, obedient in a way that’s almost frightening. “One… two… three…” He forces the pace slow, but on “four” his voice catches, like he’s about to laugh or cry. He clamps it down and continues. His heel stops tapping—replaced by a rigid stillness.

You extend the dangling hook under the board from the bottom edge, careful not to pry. The metal tip disappears into the shadow gap beneath the plank.

At first: nothing but dust and cold brick.

Then the hook catches something that *gives* like skin. A taut, slick resistance—rounded, elastic. When you draw back a fraction, it pulls back against you, and the board answers with a sharp **thup** as pressure surges.

The foamed line at the seam reacts immediately: it **strings** outward in a thin filament toward the moving hook, as if attracted. A hair-fine strand stretches from the nail hole to the hook’s tip, trembling.

Concrete threat: the medium is trying to bridge onto the hook. If it makes contact, the hook becomes a contaminated transfer point—up the rope, into Harrow’s hands, and down into Mira’s grip.

Under the board, the thing you’ve snagged shifts—like a bladder rolling or being tugged from below. You feel a tied nub or knot through the hook’s pull.

You have a feed. You also have about a second before that filament touches the hook tip and turns your “long finger” into a wick.

### Turn 84 [PLAYER]

I slosh a quick splash from the canteen onto the hook tip and the foaming strand to make it sag and drop, then hiss, “NOW—on three. One—two—THREE!” and wrench the hook hard sideways and down to tear the bladder/feed free under the board.  

“Harrow, haul the hook up fast—don’t let it touch anything. Mira, hands off the rope, keep your sleeve sealed. Clerk, don’t turn—back down five steps.”

*Agent reasoning: The filament is about to contaminate the hook/rope; I need to break the bridge and rip the feed in one decisive motion while keeping everyone from contact. Water made it sticky, so I’ll use it to wash the hook tip as a barrier and then yank on my count.*

I slosh water onto the hook tip and that foaming filament to make it sag, then snap, “NOW—on three. One—two—THREE!” and wrench the hook hard sideways and down to rip whatever bladder or line is feeding the board.  

“Harrow—haul the hook up fast, don’t let it touch rope or hands. Mira—hands off, sleeve sealed; keep staring at my coat. Clerk—don’t turn around; back down five steps.”

I slosh water from the canteen onto the hook tip and that foaming filament to make it sag and drop, then snap, “NOW—on three. One—two—THREE!” and wrench the hook hard sideways and down to rip the bladder/line free under the board.  

“Harrow—haul the hook up fast, don’t let it touch rope or your hands. Mira—hands off, sleeve sealed; keep staring at my coat. Clerk—don’t turn; back down five steps.”

*Agent reasoning: I need to stop the medium from bridging to the hook and then violently sever the feed without contaminating Harrow, Mira, or the rope; also I should create distance for the clerk/knife-dog while keeping everyone from looking at the seam.*

### Turn 89 [GAME]

Water slaps the hook tip and the hair-fine filament.

The effect is immediate—but not gentle. The violet-amber foam **collapses** into a heavier, glossy strand and **drops**, taking the tension out of the bridge before it can kiss the metal. It doesn’t dissolve; it turns syrupy and slides off in a slow ribbon, landing inside your chalk ring with a wet *plop*. The bead in the ring shudders, then goes still—like it’s holding its breath.

“NOW—”

On “THREE,” you wrench.

Under the board, the hooked thing **tears** with a sound like wet cloth ripping. The plank jumps up a finger’s width and slams back down. A burst of cold, briny air puffs out of the seam, carrying that violet sweetness—strong enough to sting the back of your throat.

The feed doesn’t come free cleanly. You drag up a short length of it: a slick, translucent **tube** the thickness of a quill, ending in a torn, pulsing **bladder-knot** that looks like a small fish’s swim sac—except it has a faint lovers’-sigil marbling through it like bruises.

As it clears the gap, the torn end **spits** a single glob of clear gel. It splashes across the stair two steps below your chalk ring and immediately starts **foaming** in a new line, creeping toward the nearest warmth—Harrow’s boots.

Harrow doesn’t argue. He hauls the hook up fast, arms locked straight so the metal stays away from rope and fingers. “Up—up—UP,” he mutters through clenched teeth, backing a half-step to keep it from brushing the wall.

Mira jerks her hands away from the rope as ordered, tucking her sleeve tight at the wrist with her teeth. She keeps staring at your coat, but her voice shakes: “It’s moving toward him.”

The clerk obeys, backing down five steps without turning. On the third step his foot skids on damp grit; he catches himself on the banister with a sharp inhale and then freezes, rigid, hands white on the rail. “I didn’t look,” he says too quickly, as if confessing.

Concrete danger: the fresh glob on the stair is **actively foaming and crawling** toward Harrow’s boots, and the torn bladder on your hook is still **pulsing**, leaking in small, timed spurts—each one a new starting point if it hits stone.

### Turn 90 [PLAYER]

“Harrow—freeze. Do not step; lift your toes if you can without moving your soles.”

I yank my coat free from the wall with my sealing hand still planted, then fling the coat down between the crawling foam and Harrow’s boots like a deadfall blanket. “Mira, keep eyes down—tell me if it changes direction.”

To Harrow: “Get that hook over open air—over the street side if you can—let it drip away from stone. If it swings back toward the wall, drop it. I mean it.”

Then, voice low to the clerk without looking at him: “What’s the warmest thing down there—lantern, stove, body? Tell me where it’ll go if we give it a better meal than Harrow’s boots.”

*Agent reasoning: The feed is severed but now the gel is actively seeking warmth—Harrow’s boots are the immediate threat. I need a fast barrier/redirect and to get the contaminated hook/bladder isolated without spreading it.*

### Turn 91 [GAME]

“Harrow—freeze.”

Harrow locks up like a statue. He manages to lift his toes a hair without shifting his heels; his boots creak against the grit but don’t slide. The crawling foam reaches the edge of your chalk ring and hesitates—then keeps coming, drawn to him in a thin, purposeful seam.

You yank your coat free. The moment your sealing hand breaks contact with the wall, the hairline shimmer you’d been holding back **flares**—a quick, pale pulse in the mortar like something exhaling. Nothing bursts through, but the wall-side air turns sharply colder.

You fling the coat down.

It lands between the foam and Harrow’s boots, heavy wool slapping wet stone. The foam hits the fabric and immediately **sinks in**, darkening the cloth in a spreading bruise. For half a second it looks contained.

Then the coat **twitches**—not from you, from the stuff inside it—like a muscle spasm. The soaked patch starts to **crawl across the coat’s weave**, seeking an edge.

“Mira,” you snap.

Mira keeps her eyes down on the stair and your coat hem. “It— it’s not going straight anymore,” she says fast. “It’s splitting. One line’s trying to go *around* the coat. The other is… going *through* it.”

Harrow, still holding the hook at arm’s length, shuffles his arms only—no feet—angling the hook outward toward the stairwell’s street-side opening. The torn bladder-knot on the hook **pulses** and spits a clear drip. The drip arcs… and catches the banister post, not open air.

The post blooms with a fresh bead of foam that immediately begins **creeping downward** along the wood grain like it knows the path.

Harrow goes rigid. “It touched the rail,” he says, voice flat with panic he’s strangling.

Your low question to the clerk gets an immediate answer—too quick, rehearsed by fear. “Lantern,” he whispers. “Bottom landing. Brass lantern on a hook. It’s been burning since morning because the Audit boys came through—said keep it lit. Warmest thing is that, then… bodies. There’s a porter asleep on a sack by the door.”

As he speaks, the foam on your coat reaches the coat’s outer edge and starts to **thread off** toward Harrow again, while the new strand on the banister begins its steady descent toward the lit landing.

The threat is now twofold: one line is still hunting Harrow’s boots at close range, and another is traveling down the banister toward the lantern—and any warm person near it.

### Turn 92 [PLAYER]

“Harrow—drop the hook. Over street-side, now. Let it fall; we can mourn the metal later.”

I yank the canteen cap fully off and splash water down the banister post where it’s blooming, chasing the bead downhill with a wet smear. “Mira—kick that lantern off its hook at the bottom and shove it out into the open—make it the warmest thing *away* from the stairs. Wake the porter if you have to, but don’t touch him bare.”

Then, to the clerk: “Keep backing down—loud steps. Make noise. If it likes warmth, it’ll like panic and motion too; give it a trail that isn’t flesh.”

*Agent reasoning: Two active paths—one near Harrow, one heading for the lantern/porter. I want to redirect it to a controlled “meal” and break its route by making the banister cold/wet, even if it costs us the lantern. Also need Harrow to ditch the contaminated hook before it seeds more.*

### Turn 93 [GAME]

Harrow doesn’t hesitate. He swings the hook out toward the street-side gap and **lets go**.

The hook drops out of sight with a brief metallic *whistle*—then a distant *clink* and a wet *slap* from somewhere below. A heartbeat later, a thin, violet-sweet **mist** puffs up from the street-side opening like breath from a drain. The torn bladder-knot is gone with it.

On the stairs, you rip the canteen cap off and throw water down the banister post.

The water hits the foaming bead and **doesn’t wash it away**—it **spreads it**. The bloom thins into a wider slick, and instead of one crawling seam you get **three**, each riding the wood grain downward like veins. The post darkens where it’s wet, and the foam uses that wetness as a faster road.

Mira is already moving. She keeps her eyes down, skirts the coat on the stair, and reaches the bottom landing. “Lantern—on the hook—” she says, then lifts a boot and **kicks**.

The brass lantern swings, hits the wall with a dull *gong*, then drops. The glass chimney doesn’t shatter—but the flame flares, and the lantern rolls, spilling a **bright oval of heat and light** across the threshold toward the open street.

The foam on the banister reacts instantly: its leading edge **accelerates**, angling toward the lantern’s new position, flowing down the last span of rail like it’s been given permission.

Mira, breathing hard, nudges the lantern again with her boot, shoving it farther out. “Porter!” she snaps—still careful not to look fully at him. A bundled shape by the door stirs and grunts.

The clerk backs down as ordered, making exaggerated, stomping steps. “I’m backing— I’m backing,” he says too loudly. His noise doesn’t lure it; the foam doesn’t even hesitate for him. It wants the lantern.

Up near you, the line that soaked into your coat reaches the coat’s edge and threads off again, still trying to get around toward Harrow’s boots—except Harrow hasn’t moved, toes lifted, breathing shallow. The coat buys seconds, not safety.

Concrete threats now:
- **Banister strands** are racing down toward the lantern and the bottom landing; if they reach the porter, they’ll have a warm body within inches.
- **Coat-thread** is still actively routing around your barrier toward Harrow’s boots.
- The street-side drop produced a **violet mist** below—whatever the hook carried is now loose in the open air outside.

“Harrow—on my count, lift your feet straight up and step back exactly one step. Don’t drag. One—TWO—NOW.”

I grab the dry inner hem of my coat (away from the soaked patch) and snap it up like a curtain, trying to scoop/flip the crawling edge inward so it has to keep eating cloth instead of finding stone.

Shouting down without looking: “Mira—keep pushing that lantern OUT. Porter too—get him into the street, wake him with your boot if you must. Nobody touches the banister.”

Then, to the clerk: “Do you have sand, ash, salt—anything dry and granular? Throw it on the banister base and the stair edge. Dry beats wet; we need it to lose its road.”

*Agent reasoning: Water made it worse; heat is baiting it downward. I need to get Harrow free without stepping into it, and redirect the whole mass away from people—preferably out into the street—while making sure Mira and the porter don’t become the next warm targets.*

“Harrow—on my count, lift straight up and step back one step. No drag. One—TWO—NOW.”

“Harrow—NOW. Lift, step back one clean step—don’t drag.”

I keep my coat folded over itself, pinning the crawling edge inside the wool like a wrapped wound, and I glance down just long enough to see if any strand has found bare stone. “Mira, keep that lantern moving into the street and get the porter after it—no hands on the banister.”

To the clerk: “Sand, ash, salt—anything gritty. Fetch it and throw it along the stair edge and at the banister base.”

“What am I seeing right now—did the foam stall, split again, or did something change with that violet mist outside?”

*Agent reasoning: There’s no new scene text—either a glitch or we’re mid-action. I’ll restate my immediate priorities: get Harrow clear without dragging, keep the lantern luring it outward, and secure dry grit to break the foam’s path; also I want clarification on what the game is showing.*

### Turn 101 [GAME]

Harrow obeys like you put a hook in his spine—both hands under the warped stair-runner, he lifts straight up, jaw clenched, and takes one clean step back.

The moment the fabric leaves the stone, the crawling foam threads hesitate—like they’ve lost a scent. Your coat fold catches most of it; it chews wool in a tight, busy line, making a faint, wet crackle. But two thin tendrils you didn’t see have already found purchase: they’re clinging to the banister’s lowest post, no wider than twine, and they’re *moving upward* in slow, deliberate spirals.

“No—no banister,” Mira says through her teeth as she shoulders the lantern outward. The lantern’s glass clears the doorway and the street fog swallows half its glow. The violet mist beyond the threshold *thins* where the lantern’s light hits it—like breath pulled away from a mirror—then *reforms* in a narrow band around the flame, reluctant but interested.

Mira plants the lantern on the curb. She turns and drives her boot into the porter’s shin. “Up. Now.” The porter jolts awake with a strangled yelp and immediately reaches for the rail out of habit—

Harrow barks, “Hands off!” and slaps his wrist away before he makes contact. The porter freezes, wide-eyed, holding his hands up like he’s been accused.

The clerk—young, ink-stained fingers shaking—stammers, “Ash—yes, yes,” and bolts for a back closet. You hear a drawer ripped open, then a metal scoop clattering. He returns with a tin pail of cold stove-ash and a cracked salt packet pinched from a desk.

He dumps ash at the banister base and along the stair edge. Where it hits the foam on stone, it doesn’t just dry it—it *scabs* it: the crawling edge stiffens into a gray, granular crust that stops advancing across the step.

But the two tendrils on the banister don’t die. They tighten, darken, and climb another inch, as if the wood is feeding them something the stone won’t.

Outside, the violet mist hasn’t thickened—it's *redirecting*, subtly leaning toward the lantern’s flame as if listening.

“Harrow, good—stay off the rail. Clerk, keep pouring ash in a line on the *steps* only; don’t waste it on the wood.”

I peel my coat back just enough to trap the chewing edge tighter, then point with two fingers at the banister tendrils. “Mira—lantern farther down the curb, slow. Keep it the warmest thing in sight.”

To the porter, sharp: “Don’t move. Look at me—have you oiled or varnished that banister recently? Spilled spirits? Any ‘cleaning’ with lye or saltwater in the last day?”

I fish a small wax-sealed vial from my kit and, without touching the rail, flick a pinch of salt toward the climbing tendrils to see if it bites or beads. “And where does that banister join the wall—any cracks, rot, or a hollow post?”

*Agent reasoning: The ash works on stone but not on wood; the banister is the real conduit. I want to learn what it is while stopping it—so I’ll isolate the banister, bait it with heat outside, and question everyone for clues.*

### Turn 103 [GAME]

Harrow keeps his hands in the air, backing off the rail like it’s hot iron. The clerk nods too hard and starts laying ash *only* on the steps—a gritty gray seam that turns the foam’s leading edge into brittle crust wherever it tries to kiss stone.

You peel your coat back a finger’s width. Inside the fold, the trapped line of foam is still chewing—wool fibers go dark, then slick, then vanish into a thin, black paste that *tries* to seep out along the seam. You cinch it tighter and it stays contained, but the coat’s inner hem is now visibly thinning.

Mira drags the lantern farther down the curb, slow like you said. The violet mist follows it in a narrow, attentive drift—less a cloud now than a leash. As she moves the light away from the doorway, the mist at your threshold *thickens back in*, reclaiming the gap the lantern left.

The porter swallows, eyes locked on you. “I—yeah. The landlord had me do it. Two nights ago. Varnish. New coat. Smelled sweet—like flowers over rot.” He licks his lips. “And… saltwater. He said it keeps the wood from swelling in the damp. Poured it right along the posts.”

You flick a pinch of salt.

The grains strike the climbing tendrils and—wrongly—*bead*, as if the salt hit oil. The crystals don’t melt; they stick and turn faintly violet at the edges. The tendrils tighten under the salt like muscle under a lash, then climb faster, spiraling up the banister post toward the first landing.

Where the banister meets the wall, you see it: a hairline crack in the plaster seam that wasn’t there a moment ago, widening with each inch the tendrils gain. The crack exhales a thin, cold breath that smells of violets and old brine.

The clerk freezes mid-pour. “That wasn’t—sir, that wasn’t there—”

A soft *tick-tick-tick* comes from inside the hollow of the lowest post, like something tapping back in answer to your counting earlier.

Threat, clear: the foam is now feeding on the varnished, salt-treated wood via the banister tendrils, and something inside the hollow post/wall seam is responding and may be about to emerge through the widening crack.

### Turn 104 [PLAYER]

“Everyone away from the banister—two steps. Clerk, keep that ash line solid on stone only. Harrow, hold my coat tight—don’t let the paste leak.”

I point at the hollow post. “Porter—who sold you that varnish, and what’s the landlord’s name? Did he say *why* saltwater?”

I edge close without touching wood and rap the *plaster beside* the crack with my knuckles—one sharp knock—then listen for the answering pattern. “Mira—bring the lantern back just enough to thin the doorway mist, then slide it sideways along the curb; I want to see if the crack ‘breath’ follows the light.”

From my kit I pull a strip of waxed paper and press it over the plaster seam above the tendrils (not the wood), trying to seal the crack’s edge and starve it of air; then I hiss, low: “If that thing comes through, we break the post—ash and cloth only. No salt.”

*Agent reasoning: The banister is the conduit—salt makes it worse, ash works on stone. Something’s inside the hollow post answering taps; I want to interrupt the feed, lure the mist away, and learn who the landlord is/what varnish was used.*

### Turn 106 [PLAYER]

“Everyone back—two steps off the banister. Clerk, keep the ash line solid on the stone only. Harrow, grip my coat and keep the paste from leaking.”

I fix the porter with a stare. “Who sold you the varnish, what’s the landlord’s name, and what exactly did he say about the saltwater?”

I lean in close to the wall *beside* the crack and give the plaster one sharp knock, then press my ear near it to catch any answering rhythm. “Mira—bring the lantern back just enough to thin the doorway mist, then slide it sideways along the curb; tell me if the crack’s ‘breath’ follows the light.”

I pull waxed paper from my kit and press it over the plaster seam above the tendrils, trying to seal the edge without touching wood. “If something pushes through, we break the post—ash and cloth only. No salt.”

*Agent reasoning: There’s no new scene text, so I’ll restate my intent: pull everyone back, interrogate the porter for names/sources, test whether the crack responds to knocks/light, and try to seal the plaster seam to slow whatever’s inside—without touching the banister.*

### Turn 107 [GAME]

Harrow clamps both hands on your coat hem and twists it into a tight roll, keeping the black paste from stringing out. A thin thread still tries to escape; he pinches it off with the coat fabric itself, grimacing as the wool smokes faintly where it touches.

The clerk retreats two steps and resumes pouring ash in a steady, unbroken line along the stone. The foam on the steps stays scabbed and stalled; it does not cross the ash.

The porter backs away, palms up. “Varnish came from Latch & Lye on Mourners’ Cut—cheap stuff. Landlord’s name is Serren Quill.” He swallows hard. “He said the saltwater was ‘for the Audit’—so the stairs ‘read clean’ if anyone came sniffing. Told me to pour it at the posts, not the steps. Said it keeps… *marks* from showing.”

You knock the plaster beside the crack: one sharp rap.

Something answers from inside the wall and the hollow post—not a knock back, but a *sequence*: three soft taps, a pause, then one longer scrape, like a fingernail dragged across wood. The same mourner’s code that woke you this morning, only warped—off by half a beat.

When you press your ear close, you hear breathing—thin and cold—coming from the crack. Under it, a wet whispering like pages being turned with a tongue.

Mira brings the lantern closer until the doorway mist thins again, then slides it sideways along the curb as instructed. The violet mist *tracks the lantern immediately*, pulling like a curtain being drawn. The crack’s breath responds a heartbeat later: as the light moves left, the cold exhale from the plaster seam shifts left too, as if whatever’s inside is orienting toward the warm glow.

You press waxed paper over the seam above the tendrils. The paper adheres to damp plaster—then bulges outward as pressure builds behind it. A dark, oily damp spreads under the wax like ink in blotting paper. The bulge holds for a second… then a thin puncture appears dead center, pushed from within by something pointed.

At the banister, the tendrils climb faster, tightening into a braided cord. The hairline crack widens another fraction, and a sliver of black glassy sheen—like a nail or shard—protrudes through the puncture in your waxed paper, testing.

Threat is immediate and specific: something inside the wall/post is probing through your seal and orienting toward the lantern’s warmth; the banister tendrils are acting as its conduit, and it is seconds from forcing a larger breach.

### Turn 108 [PLAYER]

“Mira—lantern OUT. Farther down the street, quick—make it chase. Then kill it if you can do it without coming back near the door.”

I grab the clerk by the sleeve and shove him back. “More ash—make a thick pile at the base of the post, on the stone, like a berm.”

To Harrow, urgent: “Keep that coat wrapped—do not let any paste touch wood.”

I shrug off my other coat sleeve and whip the fabric around my hand like a glove, then hook it around the banister post *without skin contact* and yank hard, trying to snap the post at its base and drag it down onto the ash. “Porter—Serren Quill. Latch & Lye. You’re coming with me after this—if we live.”

As the waxed paper punctures, I lean close and hiss at the hole, trying the mourner’s code back—three taps on the plaster, pause, then a long drag with my nail. “Who’s auditing you?”

*Agent reasoning: The thing is homing on warmth/light and using the varnished, salt-treated wood as a conduit; I want to misdirect it outside and then physically break the conduit without touching it directly, while grabbing the landlord lead for later.*

### Turn 109 [GAME]

Mira doesn’t argue. She snuffs the lantern in one hard pinch, then runs it—dark—down the curb. The violet mist hesitates, then *thins* at the doorway like a lung losing interest. A moment later, it starts sliding after her anyway, less eager without the flame, but still drawn to the lantern’s last warmth.

You grab the clerk and shove him back. He stumbles, catches himself, then dumps half his tin in a frantic pour. Ash spills where you wanted it—stone at the base of the post—forming a thick berm, but he also dusts the lowest inch of the post by accident. Where ash touches the varnished wood, it cakes and turns slick, as if the wood is sweating oil.

Harrow keeps the coat rolled tight. “It’s eating through,” he grits, and you smell singed wool. The paste stays contained—barely.

You wrap your sleeve around your hand and hook it around the banister post. The moment fabric contacts the varnished wood, it *sticks*—not glue, more like suction. You yank anyway.

The post doesn’t snap clean. It tears.

The base gives with a wet crack and a shower of splinters, and the braided tendrils whip downward like cut ropes—slapping into the ash berm. The ash hisses and blackens where they land, buying you a second: the tendrils seize, twitching, unable to cross the thickest ash without losing substance.

But the tear opens the hollow.

From inside the post, something pushes forward—thin, jointed, black-glass sheen like a finger made of bottle shards. It probes once, then *hooks* a splinter and tries to pull itself toward the gap you made. The motion is deliberate, strong, and close enough now that you can hear a faint clicking, like teeth tapping on glass.

You tap the mourner’s code back into the plaster by the punctured waxed paper.

The wall answers immediately: three soft taps—perfectly timed—then, instead of a scrape, a *voice* squeezes through the puncture as a wet whisper:

“**DECENCY.**”

The puncture widens a hair, and a sliver of black-glass “nail” presses out, testing air. It angles—not toward you now, but toward the direction Mira ran, as if tracking the lantern’s fading heat.

Immediate threats, concrete:
- The hollow-post breach is active: a shard-fingered thing is trying to lever itself out through the torn base.
- The ash berm is burning it back but also blackening and thinning where the tendrils touch.
- The wall seam entity can speak and is orienting toward Mira’s movement; if it follows her, it may leave the doorway and enter the street.

### Turn 110 [PLAYER]

“Harrow—drop my coat bundle onto the ash line on the steps, now. Let it eat wool, not wood—keep it on stone.”

I snap at the clerk, “More ash—pack it tight around that torn base like you’re sandbagging a flood. If you’ve got a metal scoop, use it—no bare hands.”

Toward the street I shout, “Mira! Don’t stop—keep moving, and if the mist closes in, ditch the lantern and run lightless!”

I lean close to the puncture without touching it and whisper back, steady, “Decency audits don’t use varnish and brine. Who is Serren Quill paying—name it. And what do you want with warmth?”

*Agent reasoning: The entity is tracking Mira and trying to breach through both post and wall; I want to keep it contained and learn what “DECENCY” means while not sacrificing Mira. I’ll redirect heat away, reinforce the ash barrier, and interrogate the voice briefly.*

### Turn 112 [PLAYER]

“Harrow—drop my coat bundle onto the ash line on the steps. Stone only; let it chew wool, not wood.”

“Clerk, more ash—pack it hard around that torn base like sandbags. Use metal if you’ve got it, no hands.”

I call down the curb, “Mira! Keep moving—if the mist crowds you, drop the lantern and run dark!”

I lean near the wax puncture, voice low. “You said ‘Decency.’ Who’s Serren Quill paying—name it. What do you want with warmth?”

*Agent reasoning: There’s no new scene text, so I’ll press the advantage—secure the ash containment at the torn base, keep Mira safe, and interrogate the speaking presence through the puncture for names and motive.*

### Turn 113 [GAME]

Harrow lurches forward and does it—drops the tight wool bundle onto the ash line on the steps, careful to keep it on bare stone. The bundle hits with a soft thud.

The black paste reacts like it’s smelled meat. It seeps through the wool in slow, hungry veins, smoking the fabric from within. The ash line holds it in place; it spreads outward across stone but doesn’t leap the ash. The wool darkens, then stiffens as if lacquered. Harrow jerks his hands back fast. “It’s taking,” he says, voice tight. “But it’ll go through the whole roll.”

The clerk, pale and shaking, fumbles a small metal dust-scoop out of his ledger satchel. He starts packing ash around the torn post base exactly like sandbags—tight, high, and thick. Where the shard-finger tries to lever itself out, it meets the ash and recoils with a sharp clicking, like glass chattering. The ash blackens in a crescent where it touches the thing, but the thicker packing forces it to withdraw an inch at a time.

Down the street, Mira’s boots slap wet stone. You hear her shout back without stopping: “I’m moving!” The violet mist peels away from the doorway in a thin streamer, following the path of her last warmth. It doesn’t surge; it *hunts*, keeping low along the curb like a tide with a mind.

At the wax puncture, you lean close and speak.

The wall answers in a wet, controlled whisper, each word pushed as if through a throat full of brine:

“Quill pays **Tollin Wreave**… to stamp *clean*.”

A pause—breathing, shallow and cold.

“Wreave pays the **Lantern**… to keep lovers… *tidy*.”

The puncture flexes. The black-glass nail angles, tasting the air.

“Warmth is a **witness**,” it says. “Warmth remembers where hands were. We take it. We file it. We make it… decent.”

Then the nail presses harder. The waxed paper creaks as the puncture widens another fraction, and a thin line of oily damp begins to run down the plaster under the paper—your seal is starting to fail.

Immediate, clear threats:
- The coat bundle is buying time, but the paste is actively consuming it; when it finishes, it will seek the next surface.
- The ash packing is holding the shard-finger in, but the ash is blackening and thinning at contact points.
- The wall puncture is enlarging; the entity is forcing a broader breach through your waxed-paper cover.
- The mist is now moving down the street after Mira; if it reaches her and she drops the lantern, it may switch to another heat source—any living body nearby.

### Turn 114 [PLAYER]

I snap to the porter, “You—rip a strip off your shirt. Now.” Then to the clerk: “Ash in my palm—no, in the scoop—dust the *plaster* around the waxed paper, make it dry, make it bite.”

I pull my tinder-tin and strike a spark into it just long enough to warm the metal, then clamp it shut and set it on the stone *inside* the ash line, a deliberate little heat-lure away from the puncture. “If warmth is a witness, then watch that.”

Leaning close to the puncture, I keep my voice calm. “Tollin Wreave. The Lantern. Tell me what the Lantern is—person, guild, or relic—and where Wreave stamps ‘clean.’ One address. One room.”

*Agent reasoning: The breach is widening and the mist is hunting Mira; I want to learn what “the Lantern” is while buying seconds. I’ll redirect the entity’s attention with controlled warmth, reinforce the seal with ash, and prepare an exit/containment plan.*

### Turn 115 [GAME]

The porter—Harrow—doesn’t ask why. He grabs the hem of his undershirt and rips hard. Cloth tears with a long, ugly sound. He hands you a strip, then immediately presses his palm to his ribs like he’s suddenly remembered he’s human. “That enough?”

The clerk obeys your correction on the spot. He keeps the ash off his skin, loads the metal scoop, and dusts the plaster around the waxed paper in quick, careful taps. The damp sheen on the wall goes matte where the ash lands. The waxed paper stops creaking for half a breath—as if the seam hates dryness.

You pop your tinder-tin, strike a spark just long enough to warm the metal, snap it shut, and set it on the stone inside the ash line.

The reaction is immediate.

The violet mist at the doorway doesn’t fully detach from the street-hunt after Mira, but a *new thread* of it curls back toward your steps, drawn to the tin’s heat like a nose finding soup. It slides along the ground, touches the ash line, and recoils—then tests again, searching for a thin spot.

At the torn post base, the shard-finger pauses its levering and angles toward the tin. The clicking changes pitch—faster, eager. It drags itself a fraction closer, but the clerk’s packed ash holds it back. The ash at that point blackens more quickly now, thinning under the repeated contact.

You lean in and ask your question.

The puncture answers—calm, almost bureaucratic:

“The Lantern is a **Society** with a **heart**. Not a person. Not a relic you can carry.”

A pause. The black-glass nail presses, then *slips* slightly against the newly-ashed plaster as if it’s lost purchase.

“Wreave stamps clean in the **Civic Mourning Office**, Lower Registry—**Room 3B**.”

It exhales something briny through the hole, and the waxed paper *dips inward* like it’s being sucked.

Then it adds, softer, with a strange, possessive edge:

“Bring warmth there. Let it testify.”

Concrete danger, now:
- Your heated tinder-tin has successfully pulled attention: a strand of mist is returning toward the steps and actively probing the ash line for a weakness.
- The shard-finger is distracted but still contained; the ash around the torn base is degrading faster under repeated tests.
- The wall seam lost leverage briefly from the ash-drying, but it’s now applying suction from inside; if the waxed paper seal fails, the breach will widen abruptly.

### Turn 116 [PLAYER]

I tie Harrow’s torn shirt-strip tight over the waxed paper like a tourniquet, then smear ash into the cloth to dry it out and blunt the suction. “Clerk—keep feeding that berm, especially where it’s blackening; if it turns slick again, tell me.”

I nudge the warm tinder-tin a few inches farther from the door, still inside the ash line, trying to keep the mist and shard-finger occupied on stone. Into the puncture, low and sharp: “Societies have marks. What’s the Lantern’s sign—on paper, on skin, on doors?”

*Agent reasoning: The breach is still active; I need to reinforce the seal and keep the entities focused on a controlled lure while extracting one more useful detail. I’m also curious about this “Society with a heart,” so I’ll press for a symbol/mark while acting fast.*

### Turn 117 [GAME]

You cinch Harrow’s torn strip over the waxed paper, tight enough that the plaster beneath creaks. The cloth bites into the wall like a bandage on a throat. When you smear ash into it, the fabric goes from limp to stiff, turning gray and crusted.

The suction behind the puncture stutters—noticeably weaker. The waxed paper stops bowing inward and settles flat under the pressure of the tourniquet. A thin ooze that had started to run down the plaster dries to a gritty, dark line and stops moving.

The clerk keeps his distance, face turned away, and shovels more ash into the berm with the metal scoop. “It’s blackening here—left side—like tar on snow,” he says, voice pinched. He packs it harder. The blackened patch holds, but it’s now visibly *thinner* than the rest of the berm; you can see stone through it in flecks.

You nudge the warm tinder-tin a few inches farther from the door, still inside the ash line. The mist-thread that had been testing the edge follows the heat’s new position like a leash being tugged. It slides along the stone toward the tin, then pools there, pressing its “face” to the ash line and worrying at it in small, repetitive pushes.

At the torn base, the shard-finger clicks and angles after the same lure. It drags, but the ash berm denies it purchase; each attempt leaves a fresh crescent of blackened ash.

You speak into the puncture.

For a moment nothing answers—just a faint, wet rasp against paper and cloth, like someone licking a stamp.

Then the whisper comes, careful, as if choosing words that won’t incriminate it:

“On paper: a **lantern** drawn with a **closed eye** in the flame.”

“On skin: a **warm spot** that never cools. Behind the ear. Inside the wrist. Lovers kiss it without knowing why.”

“On doors: a **lacquer drip**—black varnish shaped like a teardrop—set above the latch.”

The puncture shifts under your tourniquet. The nail inside *scrapes* once, frustrated.

And from the street beyond the steps, the mist-thread suddenly *thickens*—not crossing the ash, but gathering as if more of it has found the lure. If that ash line fails at its thinnest, it won’t be a trickle coming in.

No inventory changes.

### Turn 118 [PLAYER]

I scan above the latch for that black varnish teardrop mark, then bark, “Clerk—more ash, *now*, and lay something flat over the thin patch—tile, ledger board, anything stone or metal—no wood.”  

I slide my sleeve-gloved hand to the warm tinder-tin and nudge it farther along the stone, trying to draw the thickening mist away from the weak spot.  

Into the puncture, quick and intent: “Closed-eye lantern, warm spot, lacquer drip—who in this house bears it? Quill? The porter? Point me at one marked throat.”

*Agent reasoning: The ash line’s thinning where the mist is pressing; I need to reinforce it with something non-porous and keep the entity talking for more intel while checking for the Lantern’s door-mark on this building.*

### Turn 119 [GAME]

You flick your eyes to the door hardware.

Above the latch, half-hidden under peeling paint and salt bloom, there’s a glossy black drip—too deliberate to be water damage. A teardrop of lacquer set like a punctuation mark. Someone put it there and wanted it overlooked.

The clerk jolts at your barked order and overfills the scoop, ash spilling onto his shoes. He dumps it onto the berm with shaking hands. “Flat—flat—” He looks around like the room might provide a miracle. No tile. No metal plate. The nearest “board” is his ledger’s stiff backing—but it’s wrapped in treated leather and pasteboard, and he hesitates at your “no wood” like it’s a gun to his head.

Harrow makes the call instead. He yanks a thin, battered **tin serving tray** off a side table by the stairs—tarnished, dented, but metal. He slides it toward the thin patch with his boot, stopping short of the ash line. “That work?”

You nudge the warm tinder-tin farther along the stone.

The mist responds like a dog to a whistle: it peels away from the weak spot and follows the heat, pooling and pressing against the ash line where the tin now sits. The pressure at the thinned patch eases—briefly. But the mist is thicker now, and its testing is more coordinated: repeated pushes in the same place, like it’s learning.

At the post base, the shard-finger keeps clicking, still drawn toward the tin. Each click leaves another black crescent in the ash berm where it’s been worrying the boundary.

You snap your question into the puncture.

The answer comes slower this time, irritated—then sharp, certain:

“The marked throat is **not Quill**.”

A pause. The nail scrapes once under the tourniquet.

“The porter.”

Harrow freezes so hard you can hear his breath stop. His hand goes up, reflexively, to the side of his neck—behind the ear. When his fingers touch skin there, he flinches like he found a burn. “I— I don’t—” he starts, then swallows. His eyes dart to the lacquer drip above the latch as if it’s accusing him personally.

The clerk, still crouched at the berm, stares at Harrow with a new kind of fear and edges his knees backward, away from him, without standing.

Threats made plain:
- The lacquer drip confirms this door is Lantern-marked.
- The mist is now massing at the ash line near your heat lure; if the line fails anywhere, it will pour in fast.
- Harrow is identified as marked; his panic could spike “warmth” and draw the mist’s attention if he bolts or breaks the boundary.

### Turn 120 [PLAYER]

I grab Harrow by the collar and pull him close, hard but controlled. “Don’t touch it, don’t run—breathe shallow. You bolt, you feed it.” I angle his head and, without bare skin contact, peer behind his ear for the warm spot/branding.

To the clerk: “Slide the tin tray flat over the thin patch like a lid—then heap ash on the tray’s edges to weight it. Keep your hands metal-to-ash only.”

I lean back to the puncture, voice like a scalpel. “What does the mark *do*—beacon, leash, or key? And how do I make him cold enough to stop being a witness?”

*Agent reasoning: Harrow being marked makes him both a target and a key; I want to inspect the mark and keep him calm while shoring up the ash line with that tin tray. Also, I want more info from the puncture about what the mark does and how to mute “warmth.”*

### Turn 121 [GAME]

Your fist knots in Harrow’s collar and you haul him in. The fabric bunches under your knuckles; his breath catches, then comes back in short, obedient sips like you ordered. His eyes are wide but fixed on yours—anchored by the fact that you’re treating him like a problem with steps, not a man being judged.

You angle his head. Keeping your sleeve between you and his skin, you peer behind his ear.

There’s a spot the size of a thumbnail that looks normal until you stop blinking: the skin there has a faint, varnish-like sheen, as if it’s been lacquered from the inside. No visible ink. No raised scar. But the air above it feels subtly wrong—like standing near a kettle you can’t see. When Harrow exhales, the sheen brightens a fraction, then dulls.

At your command, the clerk doesn’t argue. He hooks the tin serving tray with the edge of his metal scoop and slides it forward, flat, over the thin blackening patch like a lid. The tray kisses ash with a soft scrape. He then heaps ash along the tray’s edges, packing it down with the scoop’s back until the metal is choked in gray. The thinned patch is no longer exposed.

Immediate effect: the mist’s probing at that weak spot stops. It shifts its pressure toward the nearest unreinforced arc of the ash line—closer to where your warm tinder-tin now sits—and begins pushing there instead, the fog thickening into a denser, more muscular smear against the boundary.

You lean into the puncture.

The voice answers, precise and unpleasantly satisfied:

“**Beacon** first. It tells the Society where the warmth is.”

“**Leash** second. It tugs when the invitation is near. When the music starts.”

A pause—something scrapes under your cloth tourniquet, testing.

“**Key** last. It opens *him*. Not doors.”

When you ask how to make him cold enough, the puncture exhales brine again, and the reply comes like a recipe:

“Take the warmth away. **Saltwater on the mark.** Cold iron close. Keep his mouth shut. Keep his pulse slow.”

As it speaks, Harrow’s lacquer-sheen flares—just once—like the mark heard its own description. The mist outside responds: a thicker tongue of it peels off the pooled mass and slides along the step toward Harrow’s side of the doorway, stopping at the ash line as if scenting him specifically.

Harrow whispers, barely moving his lips, “I didn’t ask for it.”

The threat is now directional: the mist isn’t just testing the barrier randomly; it’s orienting toward Harrow’s marked heat, and it’s concentrating pressure near the lure you control. If the ash line breaks there, it will surge straight toward him.

### Turn 122 [PLAYER]

I keep my grip on Harrow, forehead nearly to his, and murmur, “I believe you. Now do exactly what I say—no talking, no big breaths.”  

To the clerk: “Water—salt, now. Anything briny: kitchen crock, pickling jar, sea bucket—move.”  

I slide the warm tinder-tin a handspan farther along the stone to pull the mist’s pressure away from Harrow’s side, then fish for anything cold iron on me—keyring, nail, clasp—and hold it close to the mark without touching.  

Low to the puncture: “What ‘music’ starts the leash? Who plays it—where?”

*Agent reasoning: The mist is keying on Harrow’s mark; I need to chill/interrupt it with saltwater and iron fast while keeping him calm, and keep the ash line from failing where the lure sits. Also want more intel from the puncture but not at the cost of a breach.*

### Turn 123 [GAME]

Harrow goes still under your grip. He nods once, minuscule. His breathing turns shallow and metered; the lacquer-sheen behind his ear dulls a touch, like a flame starved of air.

The clerk scrambles, nearly slipping in ash. “Brine—yes—” He bolts up the stairs two at a time, scoop clattering. You hear a cupboard thrown open, ceramic knocking ceramic, then the slosh of liquid. He’s moving fast enough to be useful, but not quietly.

You slide the warm tinder-tin a handspan farther along the stone.

The mist obeys the heat. The thick smear that had been orienting toward Harrow’s side peels away and migrates along the ash line toward the tin’s new position, pressing there in repeated, coordinated shoves. The reinforced thin patch under the tray holds. The ash line where the mist now pushes begins to blacken in small crescents—stress marks, not yet a breach.

You fish out cold iron: your keyring has an old, pitted iron key on it—real iron, not plated. You hold it close to the mark without touching.

The air around Harrow’s ear prickles. The lacquer-sheen reacts like oil meeting a magnet: it tightens, then dims. Harrow’s eyes squeeze shut for a second, jaw clenched, but he doesn’t pull away. The mist outside falters for half a heartbeat—its “push” stutters—then resumes, harder, as if angry at losing the scent.

You put the question to the puncture.

The voice answers immediately, like it’s been waiting to say it:

“The **waltz** that isn’t written down.”

“Three notes. Then the fourth is a **name**.”

It pauses; the nail scrapes once, slow.

“Played at **Sableglass**. In the pit where the audience can’t see hands. The Lantern’s musician—**Maestro Celyne**—keeps the leash-time.”

As it finishes, the waxed paper over the puncture draws inward sharply, straining under your tourniquet, and a thin line of damp brine seeps at the cloth edge—pressure building behind the seal.

Footsteps hammer back down the stairs: the clerk returns clutching a squat pickling jar, hands slick. “Salt—salt water,” he pants, holding it out like an offering.

Right now the threats are clear and immediate:
- The mist is concentrating its force where your tinder-tin sits; that segment of ash line is blackening and weakening.
- Pressure behind the puncture is increasing; your tourniquet is holding, but it’s being tested.
- You have brine in hand, and cold iron is damping the mark—temporarily.

No inventory changes yet (the jar is being held out, not in your possession).

### Turn 124 [PLAYER]

I snatch the pickling jar, wet my gloved fingers, and dab brine onto the lacquer-spot behind Harrow’s ear—then hold my old iron key close again, steady. “Good. Quiet. Small breaths.”

“Clerk—dump a heavy crescent of ash where it’s blackening, and slide that tin tray over to *cap* the weak arc by the tinder-tin. I want metal between mist and line.”

I nudge the tinder-tin farther inward, away from the boundary, then press my ash-stiffened cloth tourniquet tighter over the waxed paper. Into the puncture, low: “Maestro Celyne—what does he *get* for playing? Coin, names, or bodies?”

*Agent reasoning: We need to cool Harrow’s mark immediately (brine + iron) and stabilize the failing ash line by relocating/insulating the heat lure; also the puncture pressure is rising, so reinforce the tourniquet and stop feeding it attention.*

I snatch the jar, wet my gloved fingertips, and dab brine onto the warm lacquer-spot behind Harrow’s ear, then hover my old iron key close again without touching. “Good—quiet—small breaths.”

“Clerk, dump a heavy crescent of ash where it’s blackening, and slide the tin tray to cap the weak arc by the tinder-tin—metal between mist and the line.”

I nudge the tinder-tin farther inward from the boundary and cinch the ash-stiffened cloth tourniquet tighter over the waxed paper. Into the puncture, low: “Maestro Celyne—what does he get for playing? Coin, names, or bodies?”

*Agent reasoning: We got a brine jar and a cold-iron key—best chance to damp Harrow’s mark fast while reinforcing the failing ash line; also the puncture is building pressure so I need to tighten the seal and interrogate it about the Maestro’s motive.*

*Agent reasoning: The scene is volatile—Harrow’s mark needs damping with brine and cold iron, the ash line is blackening near the heat lure, and the puncture pressure is rising. I’ll stabilize: treat the mark, reinforce/cap the boundary with metal and ash, pull the heat lure inward, then interrogate the puncture about Maestro Celyne’s motive.*

I snatch the pickling jar, wet my gloved fingertips, and dab brine onto the warm lacquer-spot behind Harrow’s ear; I hover my pitted iron key close without touching. “Good—quiet—small breaths.”

“Clerk, dump a heavy crescent of ash where it’s blackening, and slide the tin tray to cap the weak arc by the tinder-tin—metal between mist and the line.”

I nudge the tinder-tin farther inward from the boundary, cinch the ash-stiffened tourniquet tighter over the waxed paper, and murmur into the puncture: “Maestro Celyne—what does he get for playing? Coin, names, or bodies?”

*Agent reasoning: The mist is stressing the ash line and Harrow’s mark is acting like a beacon; I need to damp the mark with brine + cold iron, reinforce the failing arc with metal/ash, and extract more intel about this “music” and Maestro Celyne before the puncture pressure or the barrier gives.*

### Turn 131 [GAME]

Brine hits the lacquer-spot and the warmth there flinches—like you’ve touched skin that isn’t sure it belongs to Harrow. The sheen behind his ear turns briefly cloudy, then clears in a tight spiral, as if the salt is forcing something to re-write itself.

You bring the pitted iron key close. Not touching—still, the air around the key goes thin and cold. The lacquer-spot answers with a faint, insectile clicking you feel more than hear. Harrow’s jaw locks; he takes the “small breaths” you ordered, shallow and obedient, eyes wide on a point past your shoulder.

The clerk—sleeves rolled, face gray with the kind of fear that tries to become professionalism—does what you said. Ash pours in a heavy crescent where the blackening was creeping. It doesn’t stop the stain so much as *pins it*; the black edge hesitates, then reroutes along the ash like it’s following a rail.

He slides the tin tray into place. The moment metal bridges that weak arc, the mist at the boundary buckles inward, like a curtain yanked. A thin line of condensation beads along the tray’s lip—then freezes. The tinder-tin you nudge farther in gives a small, unhappy *ping* as if something tapped it from the other side.

You cinch the ash-stiffened cloth tighter. Harrow hisses through his teeth. Under the waxed paper, the puncture’s seep changes: not more blood—less. What does leak is darker and syrup-slow, and it carries that violet-amber perfume note, faint but unmistakable.

When you murmur into the puncture, the answer doesn’t come from Harrow’s mouth at first. It comes from the lacquer-spot behind his ear, vibrating against your brined fingertips—like a throat trying to speak through sealed lips.

Then Harrow speaks anyway, voice doubled, his own underneath and something smooth riding on top:

“Bodies,” it says, too quickly—then corrects itself with a little laugh that isn’t his. “No. Names that *become* bodies. Couples in ledgers. Seats filled at a theater that isn’t only a theater.”

His eyes flick to your iron key like it burns.

“Celyne gets… a clean page,” the borrowed voice adds, suddenly strained. “A pardon from the Audit. Permission to keep playing when the city decides music is indecent.”

The blackening at the ash-crescent twitches, testing the line again—this time pushing a hair-thin tendril toward the clerk’s ankle, slow and deliberate, like it’s learned where the fear is.

### Turn 132 [PLAYER]

“Clerk—don’t move. Look at me, not the line. Slow breaths.”

I flick a pinch of brine in a short arc across the tendril’s path, then jab the iron key down to the stone beside it—still not touching the mist—using the cold iron like a threat to herd it back toward the ash-crescent.

Keeping my forehead near Harrow’s, I murmur, “Audit. Clean page. Which ledger—whose names? And ‘Sableglass’—is that the Lantern’s theater, or somewhere under it?”

*Agent reasoning: The tendril is going for the clerk—if it tags him we lose our helper and maybe the whole circle. Also the “Audit” and “clean page” are juicy leads, but I need the entity pinned before I interrogate further. I’ll protect the clerk, reinforce the barrier, and press for specifics: what ledger, what theater, what “Lantern.”*

### Turn 133 [GAME]

The clerk freezes on your command like he’s been waiting all his life to be told *exactly* how to be brave. He locks eyes with you, jaw trembling, and forces his breath to match your cadence. The tendril pauses—then falters, as if attention was part of what fed it.

Your pinch of brine arcs out and spatters the stone. Where the droplets land, the hair-thin black line recoils in tight, jerky pulls, like a worm hitting salt. It tries to split around the wet spots—can’t—so it retreats, sliding back toward the ash-crescent with the reluctance of something being shoved into a corner.

You jab the iron key down beside it. The stone around the keyhead frosts in a coin-sized bloom. The mist doesn’t touch the iron, but it *acts* like it has: the tendril flattens, thins, and slinks backward along the ash rail, tucking itself into the darker patch as if hiding behind a legal technicality.

Harrow’s forehead meets yours—clammy, fever-hot. His pupils jitter. The voice that answers you is still doubled, but now it’s fighting for purchase.

“Which ledger—” Harrow’s own voice starts, then the smooth one cuts in, impatient:

“Lower Registry,” it says. “Room numbers. Ink that bites. Not the public books.”

Harrow swallows hard; his throat works like he’s choking on a word.

“Names of the *nearly* dead,” the smooth voice continues, softer now, as if savoring it. “Names of the *unmourned*. The ones the Office can reclassify. Unregistered grief—easy to move. Easy to pair.”

At “Sableglass,” the lacquer-spot behind his ear clicks again, faster—warning, not speech.

“The Lantern’s theater,” the voice says, and then—an involuntary flinch—“and under it.”

Harrow’s eyes roll toward the boundary line, then snap back to you like a dog yanked by a chain.

“Under the stage,” he whispers in his own voice, raw and terrified. “A second door. Salt stairs. I saw it once—only once—when they brought in the charity crates. It wasn’t crates.”

The clerk makes a small sound—half sob, half laugh—and clamps his mouth shut, still staring at you. The ash-crescent holds, but you see the blackening begin to *learn*: it stops pushing at ankles and starts tracing along the tin tray’s frozen lip, seeking a gap where brine hasn’t kissed stone yet.

### Turn 134 [PLAYER]

“Clerk—good. Keep your eyes on me. If you feel cold on your ankle, you tell me before you move.”

I drag a brine-wet fingertip along the tin tray’s frozen lip where the blackening is tracing, sealing the edge in a quick, continuous line, then sprinkle a thin dusting of ash over the wet like I’m salting a wound. “No gaps. Not one.”

Forehead still to Harrow’s, I whisper, “Lower Registry—whose room numbers? Give me one. And that second door under the Lantern: what’s the mark on it—lock shape, symbol, smell?”

*Agent reasoning: The mist is adapting and probing the tray edge; I want to reinforce the barrier while extracting more specifics about the Lower Registry and the under-stage access. Also, keeping the clerk calm maintains control, and Harrow’s lucid moments are precious.*

### Turn 135 [GAME]

The clerk nods without looking away from you. His lips move with the count of his own breath. “Cold—tell. Before—move.” He repeats it like a ward.

Your brine-wet fingertip drags along the tin tray’s frozen lip. The frost smears, turns to slick water, then refreezes in a cleaner, harder line as the salt takes. The blackening that was tracing the lip hits your wet seal and stops dead—no hesitation, no probing. It *can’t* cross. It bunches up behind the brine line like soot caught in a gutter.

You dust ash over the wet. The ash drinks the brine and sets into a gritty, gray crust. The tray’s edge looks stitched shut.

But the mist doesn’t surrender—its pressure changes. The boundary line pulls inward a fraction, as if whatever’s on the far side has decided to stop testing the “door” and start leaning on the “wall.” The air inside your circle grows colder; Harrow’s breath fogs.

Forehead to forehead, you press the questions.

The lacquer-spot behind Harrow’s ear vibrates against your brined glove. The doubled voice answers, clipped now, like it’s being forced through teeth:

“Room 3B,” it says. “Lower Registry. Tollin Wreave carries the keys when the senior hands are ‘praying.’”

At the name, the clerk’s eyes flick—just once—to the satchel on the floor like he knows exactly whose handwriting is on the tag.

Harrow’s own voice breaks through in a hoarse rush, as if he’s trying to get it out before the other thing clamps down again.

“Under the Lantern—door’s not wood. It’s… glass painted black from the inside. The mark is a lovers’ knot, but wrong—one loop’s cut, like it’s been half-scraped off brick.” His eyes squeeze shut. “Smells like violet-amber ash and… seawater left in a copper cup.”

The smooth voice returns, quieter, satisfied: “A lock that isn’t a lock. It opens for the paired.”

As it speaks, the ash-crescent near the blackening darkens—not spreading, but deepening, as if soaking up light. The clerk suddenly inhales sharp.

“Cold,” he says, teeth chattering. “On my ankle.”

He still hasn’t moved—yet. But the threat is clear: whatever you’ve pinned at the tray is now reaching for a new purchase, and it’s found flesh.

### Turn 136 [PLAYER]

“Don’t lift your foot—don’t kick. Just lock your knee and let me do it.”

I slide my brine-wet glove down and paint a fast ring of brine on the stone around his ankle without touching his skin, then pour a tight crescent of ash outside that ring like a collar. “Eyes on me. Breathe.”

Without breaking contact with Harrow, I angle my iron key close to the clerk’s ankle—still not touching the mist—then hiss to the thing in Harrow’s voice, “Room 3B. Tollin Wreave. Say what he *is*—clerk, auditor, or choir—then tell me what makes a ‘pair’ that opens Sableglass.”

*Agent reasoning: The mist is shifting targets to the clerk’s ankle; I need to keep him still, break its contact, and learn what Tollin Wreave/Room 3B implies before the entity adapts again.*

### Turn 138 [PLAYER]

I snap my gaze around the circle—tray lip, ash crescent, the clerk’s ankle, Harrow’s lacquer-spot—checking what shifted when everything went blank. “Clerk, report—cold still there? Any numbness?”  
I keep the iron key poised near the ankle and press my forehead to Harrow again. “Tollin Wreave—what is he, and what makes a ‘pair’ that opens Sableglass?”

*Agent reasoning: The screen blanked—either a glitch or a transition. My curious instinct is to probe the immediate danger first (clerk’s ankle, Harrow’s possession), then ask for clarification about what changed in the scene.*

### Turn 139 [GAME]

Your circle is still intact.

- The tin tray’s lip is crusted in gray ash where you sealed it; the blackening is bunched up behind that seam like tar behind a dam.
- The ash-crescent near Harrow has deepened to a near-black bruise, but it hasn’t crossed your line.
- The clerk’s ankle is inside your new brine ring—clean stone, wet sheen. Outside it, your ash “collar” sits like a shallow gutter.

The clerk’s eyes are wide and watering. He doesn’t move his foot—he’s locked his knee exactly as told.

“Cold’s… still there,” he reports, voice shaking. “Like—like a hand under my sock. Numbness starting in my toes. Not up the calf. Not yet.”

As you bring your forehead back to Harrow’s, the lacquer-spot behind his ear gives a tight, rapid tick—like a watch trying to keep time underwater. Harrow’s breath catches; his throat works.

The doubled voice answers you with a bureaucrat’s precision, and there’s irritation in it now—like you’ve made it fill out a form it hates.

“Tollin Wreave is not a clerk,” it says through Harrow. “Registrar’s assistant by title. **Choir** by function. He carries keys. He carries names. He sings the numbers into ink so the ink remembers.”

Harrow’s own voice squeezes through on the edge of a whisper: “He’s always… too clean. Hands never stained.”

You ask what makes a pair.

The smooth voice softens, almost indulgent.

“A pair is a grief accounted for twice,” it says. “Two names that share a ledger-line. Two losses that can be made to rhyme. The permit doesn’t open doors—**the matching** does.”

Your Sableglass invitation, lying where you dropped it earlier, bleeds perfume a little harder into the air at that word—violet and amber, with the faint copper tang Harrow described.

Then the threat makes itself plain: the cold at the clerk’s ankle *moves*. Not inside your brine ring—*along its edge*, skimming the boundary like a finger tracing a cuff, searching for the moment he flinches.

The clerk gasps, teeth clicking. “It’s—circling.”

Harrow’s eyes snap open, unfocused, and the lacquer-spot ticks once—loud—like a latch testing itself.

### Turn 140 [PLAYER]

“Clerk—put your weight on your heel only. Don’t let your toes curl. Stare at my left eye and count backward from twenty.”

I hook the iron key under the edge of the Sableglass invitation without touching it with my glove and drag it, slow, to the tin tray’s crusted lip—pinning the card against the metal like a specimen. Then I flick a razor-thin line of brine along the *outer* edge of the clerk’s ash collar, making a second track. “Circle the circle all you like—there’s no seam to bite.”

Forehead still to Harrow’s, voice low and sharp: “You said matching. What’s the rule—same blood, same loss, same date, same room number? Tell me what makes two griefs ‘rhyme,’ and I’ll stop tightening the cage.”

*Agent reasoning: The cold is testing for a flinch; I need to stabilize the clerk’s leg and distract/anchor the entity while extracting one more concrete detail about “matching.” The invitation reacting is a clue—use it as bait/anchor without breaking the circle.*

I snap my eyes over the circle—tray seam, ash-crescent, clerk’s ankle, Harrow’s lacquer-spot. “Clerk, keep counting—cold still circling or did it stop? Any numbness climbing?”  
I keep the iron key poised and press my forehead to Harrow again. “You said ‘matching’—what’s the rule that makes two griefs rhyme: blood, date, room number, cause? Tell me.”

### Turn 144 [PLAYER]

I freeze mid-breath and scan the room for any change in light, sound, or temperature. “Alright—time out. Narrator, what’s the current state of the circle: tray seam, ash crescent, the clerk’s ankle cold, and Harrow’s lacquer spot—what changed since my last line?”

*Agent reasoning: The display went blank twice; I need to re-establish what the scene state is before I make a move, and I’m curious whether the “matching” rule has consequences I can exploit.*

### Turn 145 [GAME]

The room answers your freeze with a few hard facts.

**Light:** The gaslamp over your desk gutters once—an inward pull rather than a flicker—then steadies. The halo around it tightens, like someone cinched a drawstring. Shadows along the baseboards lean a fraction toward the tin tray.

**Sound:** The building noise (pipes, distant street) goes thin for two heartbeats. In that thinness you can hear two distinct rhythms:
- the clerk’s teeth clicking as he counts under his breath,
- the lacquer-spot behind Harrow’s ear ticking—*not* steady now. It’s doing **two quick ticks, a pause, one tick**. Like a code.

**Temperature:** The cold at the clerk’s ankle is still present, but it’s changed behavior. It isn’t circling the brine boundary anymore. It’s **testing**: pressing in one point, releasing, pressing again a few inches away—like a thumb checking for soft wood.

Now, the specific checks you asked for:

1) **Tin tray seam:** The ash crust at the lip has **split into a hairline crack** right where you’d sealed it earlier, no wider than a thread. From that crack, a damp shine beads—*not water*. It’s slightly oily, and it smells faintly of violet-amber perfume when you lean close.

2) **Ash-crescent near Harrow:** The crescent has **spread by about a finger’s width** along the floor toward the clerk’s stance, but it hasn’t crossed your lines. The new growth is darker and finer-grained, like it burned hotter.

3) **Clerk’s ankle cold:** The clerk—Tollin—keeps counting, voice thin: “...twelve… eleven…” He swallows hard. “Cold’s still at the foot. Numbness is **to the ball of the foot now**. Not up the ankle. It’s like it’s trying to make me *move*.”

4) **Harrow’s lacquer-spot:** The spot has **raised** slightly, like a welt under the skin. The ticking-code continues. Harrow’s eyes are open now, unfocused, and he whispers without looking at you: “Vesper… it’s listening to the permit.”

As he says that, the **UNREGISTERED** stamp in your satchel gives a soft, papery *creak*—the sound of ink flexing—though nothing touches it.

### Turn 146 [PLAYER]

“Tollin—keep your heel down. If your toes curl, it wins. Keep counting.”

I lean in close to Harrow’s ear and whisper, “Two-two-one… you’re ticking code. What’s it mean—‘pair’? ‘room’? ‘Wreave’?” Then, without breaking my brine lines, I slide my satchel strap up with my elbow and nudge it farther from the tray with my boot—slow, no sudden movements.

Keeping the iron key between me and the tray, I angle it toward that hairline crack and murmur, “You want the permit? Fine—talk through Harrow and I’ll let you smell it. What is the exact match rule for a ‘pair’—same name, same date, same manner of death, or same room?”

*Agent reasoning: The tray seam is failing and the permit is reacting; I want to stabilize the circle, decode the ticking, and interrogate the “permit-listener” without letting Tollin move.*

### Turn 147 [GAME]

Tollin’s eyes go wide at your instruction like you’ve handed him a rule that might keep him alive. He locks his heel down so hard his shoe squeaks against the boards.

“Thirteen… fourteen… fif—” His toes twitch inside the leather, trying to curl anyway. He bites his own knuckle and forces them flat. “Fifteen.”

The cold responds immediately: it stops “testing” the circle and commits to him. A pale, hoarfrost sheen creeps over the edge of his shoe—only the toe cap—then halts when his toes don’t give it purchase. Tollin makes a broken sound in his throat but keeps counting. “Sixteen… seventeen…”

You lean to Harrow’s ear. The lacquer-spot ticks **2-2-1** again, then—at the sound of “Wreave”—it stutters, as if the code tripped over a nail.

Harrow’s lips move without breath.

“Not Wreave,” he whispers, voice doubled—his and something under it, like paper dragged over stone. “Wreath.”

On the tray seam, the hairline crack wets further. The oily bead swells, then draws itself into a thin thread that points—unmistakably—toward your satchel when you shift it.

You nudge the satchel away with your boot.

The response is immediate and physical: the brine line nearest the satchel dimples as if a fingertip pressed from the *inside* of the circle. Salt grains skate a millimeter, then settle. The circle holds—but something has registered the movement and is now leaning on that point.

When you angle the iron key toward the crack, the keyhead goes cold enough to sting your fingers. The crack exhales perfume, violet-amber, and Harrow’s throat works like he’s swallowing a word that isn’t his.

“You want the permit?” you say.

Harrow answers, but his eyes don’t find you. They fix on the satchel like it’s a lantern.

“The rule,” the paper-voice says through him, “is **place**.”

The oily thread at the tray seam twitches once, like a hooked fish.

“Same room,” it continues, careful and precise. “Same threshold. Two griefs that **touch the same door** become a pair.”

Tollin’s count falters on “twenty-three” as the cold tries again—harder—pressing into the toe cap. His toes quiver, fighting to curl.

The lacquer-spot ticks **2-2-1** faster now, as if excited by being understood. And the brine line at the dimpled point gives a quiet *crack*—not broken, but stressed—salt grains whitening like bone where the pressure is building.

“Tollin—stop counting. Start naming: your full name, your mother’s full name, and the address of the room you filed under. Keep that heel planted.”

I pinch a fresh line of brine and lay it *thick* over the whitening crack-point of the circle, then set the iron key flat across that stressed section like a cold iron staple. “Harrow—two-two-one: two what, two what, one what? Doors? Names? Losses?”

I keep my forehead close to Harrow’s and speak to the paper-voice. “Same threshold. Which threshold—give me the room number and building. And tell me what happens if I make a false pair on purpose.”

*Agent reasoning: “Same room/threshold” is a concrete lead; I want the room identity and what “2-2-1” encodes, but the circle is stressing near my satchel so I need to reinforce it and keep Tollin from curling his toes.*

### Turn 150 [PLAYER]

I snap my gaze around the room, then back to the circle. “Harrow—blink if you’re still in there. Tollin—heel down, speak your full name.”  
I press my thumb into the brine line to feel for vibration and tap the iron key twice against the tray lip. “You said *place*—tell me the exact threshold: room number and building, now.”

*Agent reasoning: The screen blanking feels like a pressure event or UI glitch; my curious instinct is to re-anchor the scene, check everyone’s condition, and test if the “paper-voice” is still present by reasserting the circle and prompting for concrete identifiers.*

### Turn 151 [GAME]

Your snap-scan catches the room in a hard inventory: desk, lamp, window gap, the satchel half-kicked back, Harrow on the boards inside the brine, Tollin rigid at the edge. Nothing else moves—until you look back at the circle.

Harrow blinks once. Slow. Deliberate. He’s still in there.

Tollin’s heel stays planted like it’s nailed down. His voice comes out too fast. “Tollin Wreave. Full. Name. My—my mother is Maris Wreave.” He swallows. “Filed under—Ward The Stairwell, third landing, Door 3B—Lower Registry—no, that’s not—” He clamps his jaw, correcting himself like he’s reading from a label. “Gullhook Row, Number—” His toes spasm, trying to curl; he forces them flat. The frost on his toe cap thickens to a chalky white and stops again, thwarted.

You press your thumb into the brine line.

There’s a vibration—faint, regular—like a distant engine through a wall. It’s coming from the satchel’s direction, not the tray. The stressed section under your thumb pulses in time with it, as if something is “pinging” the permit and the circle is taking the strain.

You tap the iron key twice against the tray lip.

On the second tap, the hairline crack in the tray seam **opens**—not wide, but enough for the oily bead to spill into a thin, precise line that crawls along the metal toward the keyhead. The cold on the key bites hard; your fingers go numb at the pads.

Harrow’s mouth opens. The paper-voice answers you, sharper now, irritated at being pinned to specifics.

“**Ward The Stairwell. Third landing. Door 3B.**” It says it like a filing entry. “The threshold that matters is the one you *return to*.”

Then, without warning, the oily line on the tray **hooks** toward your brine circle as if it has found a path. It doesn’t cross the salt—yet—but it presses against it at the same whitening point you’ve been reinforcing, and the brine there fizzes softly, eaten at the edges.

Threat, clear and immediate: whatever is in the tray has located the circle’s weak point and is actively trying to **breach the brine line**—using the permit’s “ping” as a guide.

Harrow’s eyes track to you, briefly his own again. He rasps, barely audible: “Don’t… give it a door.”

### Turn 152 [PLAYER]

“Alright. No more doors.”

I hook the satchel strap with my boot and drag it farther back, then flip the flap open without looking inside and shove the UNREGISTERED permit into my pocket wrapped in my handkerchief—tight, like a gag. “You don’t get to ping off my paper.”

I grind a fresh, heavy brine line over the fizzing weak point and press the iron key down across it with both hands like a clamp. Then I lean close to Harrow, voice low and urgent: “Harrow—stay with me. Tell me what ‘return to’ means: who returns, and from where?”

*Agent reasoning: The breach is targeting the weak point guided by the permit “ping,” so I need to break that signal and reinforce the circle without “giving it a door.” I’ll isolate or mute the permit, stop feeding it specifics, and buy time by sealing the fizzing point with something inert and iron-cold.*

### Turn 154 [PLAYER]

I freeze, then softly say, “Narrator—or whoever’s holding the page—what just got redacted?” I keep both palms pressing the iron key flat over the fizzing weak point, glance at Tollin’s feet to make sure his heel’s still down, and lean close to Harrow. “Harrow, talk to me—did it breach, or did we just lose the room?”

*Agent reasoning: The narration cut out—either a glitch or an in-world “blank.” I’m curious and cautious, so I’ll re-anchor the scene, check Harrow/Tollin, and probe the permit/circle for what caused the blackout.*

### Turn 155 [GAME]

Your words hit the air and then—halfway through them—the room behaves like a document someone is scrubbing.

Not silence. **Absence.**

The last two seconds of sound in the office vanish as if they were never recorded: your own voice drops out mid-syllable, the tray’s fizzing goes mute, even the lamp’s faint hiss is gone. Your mouth still moves. You feel your throat work. But the sound is **cut**.

What got “redacted” isn’t a sentence—it’s a **channel**. Something just took hold of the *act of saying* anything that names what’s happening.

Your palms are still braced on the iron key. You can feel it: the key is cold enough to sting bone, and the brine under it is still reacting—bubbling in tiny, frantic pops you can now only sense through vibration. The oily line on the tray hasn’t crossed the salt, but it has **flattened** against your reinforced weak point like a tongue pressed to glass, searching for seam.

You glance at Tollin’s feet.

His heel is still down—hard. But his boot leather has **creased inward** as if something is pushing from above, trying to force his foot to pivot. His face is wet with sweat. He tries to answer you and nothing comes out; he claps a hand over his own mouth, eyes wide, realizing the same thing you did: speech is being selectively strangled.

Harrow’s eyes lock onto yours. His lips move.

No sound.

Then he does something else—because he can’t talk. He lifts his right hand inside the circle, index finger trembling, and **writes** on the floorboards in the thin wet sheen of brine that’s splashed inward:

**RETURN = THE AUDIT**
**NOT YOU**
**THEY COME BACK THROUGH YOU**

The moment the last word is formed, the black glass shard—still in the satchel you dragged back—**hums** hard enough to rattle the desk’s inkwell. The vibration in the brine line syncs with it, stronger now.

Concrete threat: the “redaction” is an active suppression effect tied to naming/description, and the shard/permit are acting like beacons. The oily thing still hasn’t breached the salt, but it’s found your pressure point and it’s escalating in response to Harrow’s written disclosure.

### Turn 156 [PLAYER]

I stop trying to speak and yank my handkerchief out, wrap it tight around the black glass shard without looking, then shove it deep into the satchel and cinch the satchel shut with my belt like a tourniquet.  

I crawl to Tollin and brace his ankle with my left hand, pressing his heel down into the boards, then with my right I smear a thick brine “heel-cup” around his shoe like a splint.  

Back at the circle, I scratch on the floorboards for Harrow to see: **CAN YOU DRAW THE AUDIT’S MARK?** and then **HOW TO STOP “THROUGH YOU”?**

*Agent reasoning: Speech is getting cut when we name the situation, so I’ll switch to gestures/writing. The shard and permit are beaconing; I need them isolated. Tollin’s foot is being forced—stabilize him physically. Also, Harrow’s warning implies “The Audit” returns through people, so I’ll block the “through” by grounding/warding bodies and severing the beacon link.*

### Turn 157 [GAME]

The handkerchief closes around the black glass like it’s biting down on a wasp. The hum dulls immediately—still there, but muffled, no longer rattling the inkwell. When you stuff it deep into the satchel and cinch the whole thing shut with your belt, the “ping” sensation in the room slackens: the brine line’s vibration drops from a steady thrum to an occasional twitch.

It doesn’t stop the redaction. It stops the shard from *amplifying* it.

At Tollin’s feet, your left hand pins his ankle and you force his heel flat. The push trying to roll his foot eases the moment your brine “heel-cup” seals around the shoe. The saltwater hisses where it touches the frost on his boot, and the chalky white retreats a finger’s width up the leather. Tollin’s eyes squeeze shut; his jaw works like he’s chewing a scream he can’t make. He nods once—grateful, terrified—and keeps his weight committed.

Back at the circle, you scratch your questions into the boards.

Harrow reads them, pupils tightening. He lifts his brine-wet finger again and draws.

First: a mark that looks like an **official stamp** gone wrong—an oblong seal with a neat border, but the center is a **couple’s sigil** rendered in bureaucratic geometry: two interlocked hooks facing inward, joined by a thin line that ends in a tiny square checkbox. Around it he adds three short ticks like tally marks.

As the last tick goes down, the tray reacts: the oily line that had flattened against your reinforced weak point **rears** into a thin standing ridge, as if it’s trying to become a needle. It probes the salt at the exact whitened spot under the iron key-clamp, searching for a gap.

Second: he writes, slower, shaking harder:

**STOP “THROUGH YOU” = NO NAME / NO PERMIT / NO THRESHOLD**
**CUT THE RETURN PATH**
**DON’T LET IT LOG YOU**

When he finishes “LOG YOU,” Tollin’s pocket—where his registrar’s badge chain hangs—**jerks** once, metal tugged by an invisible hand. Tollin clamps it with his fingers, eyes darting to you.

Immediate threat is now explicit: whatever is on the tray is trying to use **registry mechanics** (names, permits, logged thresholds) to classify you as a passage. The shard being muffled helped, but the Audit-mark being drawn gave it something to lock onto; the oily ridge is actively probing the one stressed point in your brine line, and Tollin’s registrar ID just got “noticed.”

### Turn 158 [PLAYER]

I yank Tollin’s badge chain free and wrap it in my handkerchief (or a scrap of cloth), then shove it into the satchel with the shard and cinch it tighter—no loose registry metal on him.  

I scrape my own name and any identifying marks off anything exposed (labels, notes), then use brine to smear Harrow’s drawn Audit-mark into an unrecognizable blur and wipe my fingertips clean—no clean stamp to “read.”  

I scratch to Harrow: **DRAW A FALSE THRESHOLD (SAFE) + HOW TO CUT RETURN PATH?** then I pour a second brine ring *outside* the tray and kick the tray onto it like I’m quarantining a spill, keeping the iron key pressed over the weak point until the last second.

*Agent reasoning: The “Audit” is trying to log us via names/permits/thresholds—so I need to de-identify everyone, neutralize Tollin’s badge, and cut the return path before the oily needle finds a seam. I’m curious about the sigil too, so I’ll copy it for later while keeping it out of the circle’s logic.*

I bite my tongue and stop trying to speak; I rip Tollin’s badge chain off and wrap it in cloth, then bury it deep in the belt-cinched satchel with the muffled shard.  
Keeping my palms on the iron key, I drag the tray onto a fresh outer brine ring like I’m corralling a spill, then smear Harrow’s Audit-mark into a formless blur and wipe my fingertips clean on my coat hem.  
I scratch to Harrow on the boards: **SHOW (DON’T NAME) HOW TO CUT RETURN PATH** and **CAN YOU DRAW A DECOY THRESHOLD THAT WON’T LOG US?**

*Agent reasoning: The feed blanked again—likely redaction hitting harder when I mess with registry objects/marks. I need to keep the “no name/no permit/no threshold” rule, physically isolate the tray, and get nonverbal instructions from Harrow while watching Tollin’s heel and the weak point.*

I keep my mouth shut and tighten the belt-cinch on the satchel again, then point at Tollin’s now-bare collar and give him a firm, steadying nod to keep that heel planted. I smear the Audit-mark into sludge, wipe my fingers clean, and then slide a plank-splinter to Harrow and tap it twice—**draw, don’t write words**—before tracing a simple “cut” gesture across my own wrist and pointing at the tray, asking him to *show* how to sever the return path and sketch a decoy threshold.

*Agent reasoning: The last exchange suggests “redaction” is suppressing named description; I should communicate with gestures/writing, reduce registry hooks (badge/mark), and focus on cutting the “return path” by severing permit/name/threshold links while maintaining the brine containment.*

### Turn 164 [PLAYER]

I stay silent, keep one hand pressing the iron key over the weak point, and with my free hand I tap out a slow three-beat pattern on the floorboards (our “still here?” check). I look between Harrow and Tollin for any nonverbal response, then carefully drag a fingertip through the brine to sketch a question mark and a simple door-outline—asking if the “return path” is a doorway/threshold—without writing any words.

*Agent reasoning: Everything’s gone blank—either a redaction surge or a glitch. My curious investigator instinct is to test what still “exists” in the scene without naming it, and to get nonverbal confirmation from Harrow/Tollin while maintaining containment.*

### Turn 165 [GAME]

Your three slow taps land dull against the boards.

Tollin answers without thinking—one tap, then a second, then a third—exactly on your spacing. Relief flashes across his face and dies immediately as he realizes he’s done something *trained*. He clamps his lips shut hard enough to blanch them and plants his heel like you told him, eyes flicking to the office door as if expecting it to answer back.

Harrow doesn’t mirror the taps. He watches them, head angled, like he’s listening to the *gap* between beats more than the sound. Then he shifts his weight and drags the toe of his boot through the outer brine ring you pulled the tray onto—careful, controlled—making a clean break in the circle.

The air changes at that break. Not a gust—more like the room suddenly remembering it has a direction.

When you draw the question mark and the simple door outline in the brine, Harrow crouches and takes the plank-splinter you’d slid him earlier. He doesn’t write. He draws.

1) First: a doorframe like yours, but he adds a thin line across its base—*a threshold*. He taps that base line twice, then points at the iron key under your palm.

2) Second: he draws the same doorframe again, but this time he shades the inside with tight diagonal strokes, like a curtain or a screen. He makes a slicing motion across the shaded “door,” then flicks the splinter outward—*cut it, don’t open it*.

3) Third: he draws a smaller doorframe off to the side—crooked on purpose—and circles it. Then he draws a little square beside it and marks it with a neat stamp-like block: three short lines stacked. Tollin sucks in a breath through his nose when he sees that—recognition. *A log mark.*

Harrow points at the crooked doorframe, then points at the clean break he made in your brine ring, then points toward the office window’s back service gap.

As he does, the black glass shard inside your cinched satchel gives one muffled, insectile *thrumm*—and the shadows near the room’s actual doorway tug a fraction of an inch toward the hall, like something outside just shifted its stance to listen.

### Turn 166 [PLAYER]

I clamp my hand harder over the iron key and give Harrow a sharp nod, then silently point: real door → then the shadows tugging that way → then the crooked decoy in his drawing.  

Keeping my mouth shut, I tilt the satchel away from the doorway, then with my free hand I splash brine and sketch a crooked little “doorframe” at the back service gap—low and ugly on purpose—then I press my thumb into the brine beside it three times to mimic the log-mark and *invite* the stamp there instead of on us.  

Then I use two fingers like scissors and slice a wet line through the brine “base” of the *real* door-outline I drew earlier, and I shove that cut line outward toward Harrow’s break in the ring—cut it, don’t open—before jerking my gaze to Tollin and tapping his planted heel once: hold.

*Agent reasoning: Harrow’s saying the “return path” is a threshold anchored to the key and the door; we need a decoy threshold to take the log and then cut/redirect the real one toward the service gap without “opening” anything. Also something outside heard the shard, so I want to move fast, stay silent, and keep Tollin stable.*

### Turn 167 [GAME]

Your palm grinds the iron key down into the weak point until the wood complains. The cold bite of it steadies the tremor in the boards.

When you angle the satchel away from the doorway, the shard’s muffled thrumm dulls—but doesn’t stop. Like a wasp in a jar you’ve turned so it can’t see the light.

You splash brine at the back service gap and sketch the crooked, low doorframe. The brine crawls into the grain of the floor and holds the shape better than it should. Three thumb-presses beside it—your imitation of the log-mark—leave little cratered stamps.

Harrow’s eyes follow your thumb, then flick to Tollin. Tollin’s throat bobs; he keeps his heel planted.

You slice the wet “base” of the real door-outline with two fingers and shove the cut outward toward Harrow’s break in the ring.

The effect is immediate and concrete: the shadows at the *real* doorway slacken, like a tensioned line cut. The subtle tug toward the hall stops. In its place, the brine at your crooked decoy doorframe at the service gap begins to *darken*—not with dirt, but with a thin, ink-like seep that spreads from your three thumb-stamps outward in hairline veins.

A sound answers from the hall: not footsteps—paper. A stack shifting. A slow, careful scrape like a ledger dragged an inch across a desk.

Tollin flinches at that sound, but your single tap to his heel anchors him. He locks his knee, knuckles whitening at his sides. He doesn’t look at the door. He looks at your hand on the key.

Harrow rises halfway, keeping low, and points sharply at the decoy mark you made—approval, but urgent. Then he lifts two fingers and mimics your scissor-cut again, this time toward the *service gap*, as if to say: be ready to cut *there* next.

The ink-dark brine at the decoy doorframe puckers once—like a mouth trying to form around a hinge—then holds, waiting.

Whatever is “stamping” your trail has taken the bait… and is now testing whether that crooked little threshold will open.

### Turn 168 [PLAYER]

I keep the iron key pinned hard with my palm and lean my weight into it, then point at the puckering decoy “mouth” and hold up two fingers at Harrow—ready to scissor-cut on his signal.  

With my free hand, I sprinkle a thin *second* brine crescent just outside the decoy doorframe (not closing a full ring—more like a catch-basin), then I hover my fingertips near the ink-dark brine without touching it, watching for a reaction.  

I glance at Tollin and silently gesture: eyes on the *real* door, don’t move your heel—then I slowly tug my satchel strap higher on my shoulder, preparing to move the instant Harrow indicates an escape route.

*Agent reasoning: The decoy threshold is attracting the logger; I want to learn what it is without letting it fully manifest, and I need an exit plan. I’ll probe gently, keep the key pinned, and coordinate silent roles with Harrow and Tollin, ready to cut the decoy the moment it tries to open.*

### Turn 169 [GAME]

You lean into the iron key until the floorboard’s flex turns into a stubborn, held line—like you’ve pinned a seam shut.

Harrow sees your two fingers and gives you a single, flat nod. No signal yet. His gaze stays glued to the service gap and the brine.

You lay the second brine crescent outside the crooked doorframe. It doesn’t complete a ring—just a shallow catch-basin. The moment it touches the ink-dark seep, the brine crescent *fizzes* silently, as if it’s eating something that isn’t saltwater. A thread of that ink tries to creep into your new crescent and then stalls, beading up like oil refusing to mix.

Hovering your fingertips near the dark brine, you feel it: a faint suctioning cold, like breath being drawn through a keyhole. The puckered “mouth” at the decoy doorframe tightens and loosens once—testing.

Then it commits.

The ink-dark brine swells into a thin, vertical film inside your crooked door outline—no thicker than wet paper. Shapes press from the far side: not a hand, not a face—rectangular corners, stacked edges. Ledger geometry. The film dimples three times exactly where you thumb-stamped, as if something on the other side is trying to line up a seal.

From the hall, the paper-sound returns, closer now: a careful slide, a stop, then the faint click of a stamp pad being opened. You can’t see it, but you can *place* it—right outside the real door.

Tollin obeys your gesture without a word. His eyes stay on the real door so hard they water. His heel remains planted, but his other foot pivots a fraction, unconsciously bracing to bolt.

As you tug the satchel strap higher, the shard inside answers with a sharper *thrumm*—and the shadows under the real door briefly thicken, as if something leaned down to look in.

Harrow finally signals: two fingers, scissor-sharp—*now*—and he points not at the real door, but at your decoy film, warning clear in the angle of his wrist.

The threat is immediate: whatever is trying to “stamp” you is about to push through the decoy threshold, and something in the hall is simultaneously positioning at the real door with a stamp and ledger.

### Turn 170 [PLAYER]

I scissor-cut hard through the ink-film at the decoy doorframe—fast, mean—then sweep my brine crescent like a squeegee to drag the severed “mouth” into the catch-basin and break it up. Without speaking, I jab two fingers at Tollin’s planted heel again—hold—then flick my eyes to Harrow and point at the service gap, asking with a sharp look: do we slip out *now* while the hall-stamper is distracted?

*Agent reasoning: Harrow’s signal means cut the decoy threshold immediately before it fully opens; keep the iron key pinned to prevent a return-path snapback, and keep Tollin anchored while we redirect the stamp away from the real door.*

### Turn 171 [GAME]

Your two fingers scissor through the ink-film like cutting wet paper.

It cuts—but it doesn’t *bleed*. It *snaps*.

The vertical film collapses inward with a papery crackle, and for half a heartbeat you see what was behind it: a tight stack of black-edged forms like ledger pages pressed together, each corner stamped with a faint three-line log mark. Then the whole stack recoils as if yanked back by a cord.

You sweep your brine crescent through the collapsing “mouth,” dragging the severed edge into the catch-basin. The brine there boils in tiny, soundless pinpricks. The ink breaks up into beadlets that skitter around the crescent’s curve, refusing to settle—like living punctuation. A few beads try to climb back toward the crooked doorframe and fail, leaving thin gray smears like erased pencil.

Immediate consequence: the decoy threshold is neutralized. Whatever was pushing through it has been forced back.

Not free: the hall answers.

From the real doorway comes a sharp, administrative *thunk*—a stamp landing on wood. Then another, lighter *thunk*, as if correcting alignment. The shadows under the door *bite* into the floorboards in three short bars, matching your thumb-stamp pattern. A thin line of dampness creeps in from under the door, not brine—ink-water, smelling faintly of violet-amber ash.

Tollin jerks at the sound but your two-finger jab holds him in place. He makes a small choking noise and clamps it down, eyes wide, still staring at the crack under the real door.

Harrow doesn’t answer your look with words. He answers with motion: he grabs the back of Tollin’s collar with one hand, and with the other he points at the service gap—yes, *now*—then holds up a single finger: *one beat*.

He’s timing it.

On the other side of the real door, something drags—slow, deliberate—like a heavy ledger being set flush against the threshold. The ink-water line under the door thickens, searching for the brine cut you made earlier, trying to find purchase.

Threat, clear: the hall-stamper is establishing a logged claim on this room through the real door; if it completes the “registration,” it won’t need the handle to come in. Harrow is about to move you through the service gap on his count—before that claim finishes setting.

### Turn 172 [PLAYER]

On Harrow’s single-beat count, I swipe two fingers through the ink-water under the real door and smear it onto a scrap of cloth for later, then immediately drop low and slip for the service gap, keeping my palm on the iron key until the last possible moment. As I move, I hook two fingers into Tollin’s sleeve to steer him after Harrow, and I silently point back at the door—warning: no looking, no speaking, just go.

*Agent reasoning: Harrow’s giving a timed exit; I want to slip out before the claim sets, but I’m also curious—grab a quick detail from the ink-water and keep the key pressed as long as possible to delay entry.*

### Turn 173 [GAME]

On Harrow’s beat you rake two fingers through the ink-water line under the real door.

It’s colder than brine—numbingly, *clerical* cold—and it clings to your skin with a tacky resistance, like it wants to stay in a line. You smear it onto a scrap of cloth in one hard stroke. The cloth immediately stiffens along the smear, fibers tightening as if starched; the violet-amber ash scent comes up sharp enough to sting the back of your throat.

At the real door, the ink line hesitates—thins where you stole from it—then surges to replace itself, now pushing in two narrow “tongues” instead of one.

You keep your palm on the iron key until the last instant, then drop low and slide toward the service gap.

The moment your pressure leaves the key, the floorboard gives a tiny, exhausted *creak*. The doorframe answers with a sound like a stamp pad closing: a soft, final *clack*.

Under the real door, the shadows bite deeper. Three short bars appear again, darker and more defined, as if the threshold has just been “entered” into a ledger.

Harrow moves first, yanking Tollin by the collar toward the service gap. Tollin stumbles, catches himself, and follows—silent, eyes fixed forward like you ordered. When you hook two fingers into his sleeve to steer, you feel his arm shaking hard enough to telegraph through the fabric.

As you gesture your warning—no looking, no speaking—the real door handle does **not** turn.

Instead, a thin rectangular shadow—perfectly straight-edged—slides under the door like a sheet of paper being fed through a slot. It glides across the floor toward where you *were*, leaving behind a faint, drying trail that looks like ink that never quite decided to be liquid.

Threat made plain: whatever is outside is no longer trying to open the door; it’s extending something *through the registration line*—a ledger-sheet presence that can reach and mark without entry.

You, Harrow, and Tollin make it to the service gap. Harrow wedges himself through first, then hauls Tollin after him. As Tollin squeezes through, the satchel on your shoulder gives a sharp hum—your shard responding to the salt-air on the other side.

Behind you, the paper-shadow pauses, then angles—like it has “noticed” the gap.

### Turn 174 [PLAYER]

I slip through the service gap after Tollin, then immediately drag my brine-wet fingers across the edge of the opening like a quick salt-swipe and tug my coat hem over it—anything to foul a clean “threshold.” In a low whisper once we’re out, I ask Harrow, “Where does this spit us—alley, stair, crawl?” and I catch Tollin’s sleeve, checking his hands for any new three-bar “log” marks before I hold up the stiffened cloth scrap to the salt-air and watch how it reacts.

*Agent reasoning: The paper-shadow has “noticed” our escape route; I want to get everyone clear, then learn what the ink-water sample does and where this gap leads before it can mark us.*

### Turn 175 [GAME]

You slide through the service gap into cold, salt-heavy air.

It spits you into a back service run: a narrow exterior catwalk bolted to the building’s spine, half-sheltered by warped awnings. Below is an alley throat—cobbles slick, fish-oil sheen, a drain that breathes fog. To your left: a short iron stair down to the alley. To your right: the catwalk continues past shuttered windows toward a soot-stained ladder that climbs to the roofline. The sea is close enough you can hear stone being slapped.

You drag your brine-wet fingers across the metal lip of the gap. The salt leaves a smeared, gritty line. When you tug your coat hem over it, the fabric snags and you feel a brief tug—like a static pull—then it lets go. The “clean edge” is fouled, at least for the moment.

Inside, through the gap, something makes a dry sliding sound—paper searching for a slot. It doesn’t come through immediately, but you can hear it testing the opening from the other side.

Harrow answers your whisper with a quick, practical murmur: “Catwalk. Down to the alley in ten steps. Up to roof if we need clean air.” He keeps his body between the gap and Tollin, one hand already on the stair rail.

You catch Tollin’s sleeve and turn his hands palm-up. His fingers are ink-stained from panic-sweat and old forms, but there’s no fresh three-bar log on his skin. Not on the knuckles, not in the creases. What you do find: a faint rectangular pressure mark on his wrist, like he recently wore a tight band—too straight-edged to be a watch.

When you hold up the stiffened cloth scrap to the salt-air, it reacts fast. The smeared ink-water doesn’t dry; it *webs*. Fine lines crawl outward from the smear in right angles, sketching a partial grid across the fibers—ledger rulings. As the fog hits it, the violet-amber ash scent blooms, and the grid briefly resolves into three short bars near the center—then blurs again, as if the air is trying to “read” it and can’t keep focus.

Threat becomes concrete: from inside the gap, a thin, straight-edged shadow presses toward the opening. Your salt-swipe makes it hesitate, but it starts to probe along the edges, looking for a clean, unbroken line to slip through. Harrow’s eyes flick to your cloth scrap, then back to the gap. “That thing’s keyed to records,” he says. “And it’s learning.”

### Turn 176 [PLAYER]

I grab Tollin’s wrist and, still whispering, ask, “That rectangular pressure mark—what was on you? Band, cuff, tag?” Then I press the stiffened cloth scrap flat against the metal edge of the service gap like a blotter, trying to “pull” any of the probing ink-shadow into the grid, and immediately salt-swipe over it again.  

I glance up the catwalk toward the ladder and down toward the alley and murmur to Harrow, “Roof for air and sightlines, or alley to lose it in fog—what’s your read?”

*Agent reasoning: The thing is adapting and probing the gap; I want to slow it down while investigating that odd rectangular wrist mark and the cloth’s “ledger” reaction for clues. We also need a quick escape route choice—alley vs roof—based on what we can learn in seconds.*

### Turn 178 [PLAYER]

I clamp Tollin’s wrist and whisper, “That rectangular pressure mark—what was on you? Band, cuff, tag?”

I press the stiffened cloth scrap flat to the service-gap lip like a blotter, trying to draw the probing ink-shadow into its grid, then immediately salt-swipe the edge again to foul the line.

I flick my eyes up toward the roof ladder and down toward the foggy alley and murmur to Harrow, “Roof for air and sightlines, or alley to lose it in the fog—what’s your read?”

*Agent reasoning: I want answers about Tollin’s wrist mark and to test whether the cloth scrap can trap or “record” the probing shadow; then I need Harrow’s judgment on the safest escape route.*

### Turn 180 [PLAYER]

I clamp Tollin’s wrist and whisper, “That rectangular pressure mark—what was on you? Band, cuff, tag?”  

I press the stiffened cloth scrap flat against the service-gap lip like a blotter, trying to pull the probing ink-shadow into its grid, then salt-swipe the edge again to foul the threshold.  

I glance up toward the roof ladder and down into the foggy alley and murmur to Harrow, “Roof for air and sightlines, or alley to lose it in the fog—what’s your read?”

*Agent reasoning: We need to know what marked Tollin, try to trap the probing shadow using the ledger-grid cloth, and pick the safest escape route based on Harrow’s instincts.*

### Turn 181 [GAME]

Tollin flinches when you clamp his wrist. His eyes snap to the rectangular mark like you’ve named a bruise he’d been pretending wasn’t there.

“Tag,” he breathes. “Registry band-tag. Waxed paper with a tin clasp—goes on when you pull sealed effects. It… it makes you *legible* to the shelves.” His throat works. “I took it off before I came. I swear I did.”

You slap the stiffened cloth scrap over the service-gap lip.

The probing shadow on the other side—thin as a file edge—touches the cloth and *sticks* for half a second. The grid on the fabric sharpens, the right-angled rulings going crisp like a form filling itself in. A cold, inky pressure pushes into the weave, and you feel it through your fingertips: not wet, not dry—like a stamp about to come down.

Then you salt-swipe hard over the metal edge.

The salt fouls the line, and the shadow recoils, but it doesn’t retreat cleanly. It shears—leaving a small, hooked sliver embedded in the cloth scrap’s grid. The sliver twitches once, like a fishhook testing tension, and the violet-amber scent spikes sharp enough to sting your nose.

Inside the gap, the rest of it withdraws with a papery rasp—angry, searching. The opening darkens as if something flat is being pressed across it from the office side, trying to re-establish a “clean” boundary. You’ve bought a moment, not solved it.

Harrow watches the cloth, then the alley, then the ladder. He doesn’t posture—he commits.

“Alley,” he says, low and certain. “Roof gives sightlines to *them*, too. Up there you’re a silhouette against gaslight and fog. Down there—noise, bodies, drains. We can cut the hook.”

As he says it, you hear boots on the interior stairwell behind the wall—measured, municipal pace. Not running. Coming to check why a record is failing to file.

Tollin swallows, eyes fixed on the cloth scrap like it’s now wearing his name. “That—” he whispers. “That’s a retrieval slip. If it gets a full line on you, it’ll follow you to a shelf.”

The hooked sliver in the cloth gives another small tug—toward Tollin’s wrist.

### Turn 182 [PLAYER]

I jerk the cloth scrap away from Tollin and fold it inward on itself—grid to grid—then jam it into a glass vial from my kit and cork it hard, salt packed around the stopper. “Nobody touches this,” I hiss.

I grab Tollin’s wrist and smear a gritty salt-and-alley-filth mix across that rectangular pressure mark, then tug my own sleeve over his hand like a glove. “You’re not legible,” I whisper. “Say your name to no one.”

To Harrow: “Alley. Now.” I push Tollin ahead down the iron steps, but I glance back once at the service gap, trying to catch a glimpse of what shape is pressing flat against it—paper, person, or something worse.

*Agent reasoning: The sliver is trying to “complete” a line to Tollin—priority is breaking the connection fast. Alley offers drains and grime to scramble a clean record-trail; I also want to preserve the sliver as evidence without letting it latch.*

### Turn 183 [GAME]

The cloth scrap fights you—just a little—when you fold it grid-to-grid, like two sticky pages reluctant to kiss. You force it shut anyway and ram it into a squat glass vial from your kit. When the cork goes in, the hooked sliver inside *taps* the glass once, then starts a faint, steady skittering—like a pen searching for a line that isn’t there.

You pack salt around the stopper. The skittering dulls to an occasional, irritated click.

Tollin’s breath comes fast through his nose. “Okay. Okay—” he starts, then you smear the salt-and-alley grit into the rectangular pressure mark. The grime bites into the skin and the mark visibly blurs at the edges, the clean geometry breaking into a dirty thumbprint. When you pull your sleeve down over his hand, he stiffens—then nods like he’s taking orders in a fire.

“I won’t,” he whispers. “No name.”

Harrow is already moving, shoulder angled to block the alley sightline as you push Tollin down the iron steps. The steps complain—high, metallic squeals—too loud in the fog.

You glance back at the service gap.

Something *is* pressed flat to it: not a person. A sheet—pale, waxed paper, the size of a registry form—held perfectly flush as if by suction. Through the narrow slit you catch a corner lifting and settling, testing the seal. Along its edge runs a tin clasp that winks once in the gaslight.

And behind that paper, you see a face for half a second through the wrong reflection of the black glass shard still in your satchel: a municipal clerk’s profile, too smooth, eyes down like reading—except the mouth is stitched shut with a line of dark thread.

From inside the building, a door opens. A real voice calls, muffled by wall and paper: “Service gap—who’s out there? Identify yourself for the log.”

The waxed sheet makes a soft, eager sound—like a page being turned.

Down in the alley, fog curls around your ankles. A gutter-run of seawater slides toward a storm drain, and as Tollin hits the bottom step, the water *changes course* by an inch, angling toward him as if sniffing.

Harrow grabs Tollin by the elbow and yanks him left, away from the drain. “Move,” he says, flat. “Don’t stop. Don’t answer.”

### Turn 184 [PLAYER]

I hiss up toward the gap in my best bored-dockhand tone, “Just rats in the service run—tell Records to fix their damn latch,” then I pull Harrow and Tollin deeper into the alley, away from drains and clean edges.  

I scoop a fistful of gritty slush and salt and fling it across the gutter-stream behind us to foul the water’s “line,” then duck us under the nearest overhang and whisper to Tollin, “Registry band-tag—where’d you ditch it? Exact place.”  

While we move, I keep the salt-corked vial in my palm and watch for any change in the clicking—does it point, pulse, or quiet when we turn corners?

*Agent reasoning: The “log” is trying to get a name/identifier and the drain-water is tracking Tollin; I want to misdirect the clerk, break the water’s trail, and learn what the vial-sliver does without letting it tag us.*

### Turn 185 [GAME]

Your dockhand-bored call floats up through the ironwork.

There’s a beat—then the muffled municipal voice answers, irritated and automatic: “Noted. Keep clear of the premises.” The waxed sheet at the service gap peels back with a reluctant *shrrp*, like it’s been told to stop feeding. You don’t hear pursuit—just the scrape of a pen, the soft closing of a door, and footsteps resuming their measured route inside.

You haul Harrow and Tollin deeper into the alley, choosing broken brick and greasy cobble over anything with a clean seam. Harrow mirrors you, steering Tollin around a pale line of mortar like it’s a tripwire.

At the gutter you fling gritty slush and salt across the thin stream. The water stutters, loses its neat channel, and spreads into a dull, confused sheet. Whatever subtle “aim” it had toward Tollin breaks; it eddies around the salt clumps and runs on without preference.

Under the nearest overhang—an old fishmonger’s awning frame with canvas long gone—Tollin hunches, trying to make his breathing quiet.

“Band-tag,” he whispers. “I ditched it in the Ward—The Ladder And Down. Third step. I— I slid it under the lip where the tread’s split. Thought it was clever. Thought nobody’d—” He swallows. “That’s where it is. If it’s still there.”

In your palm, the salt-corked vial’s clicking changes as you move: when you turn left past a bricked-up doorway, it goes almost silent—just a faint, sulky tick. When you angle back toward the main cut where the stairwell would be, it resumes a quicker, impatient *tap-tap-tap*, like it’s trying to agree with a direction you’re refusing.

Harrow notices your glance at the vial. “It’s got a nose,” he murmurs. “Keep it salted.”

Ahead, the fog thins just enough to show two shapes at the alley mouth—men in dark coats under a shared umbrella, not moving like drunks. One of them turns his head slightly, as if listening for the iron-step squeal you already made.

They haven’t seen you yet. They’re waiting for something to come out cleanly into the street.

### Turn 186 [PLAYER]

I pull Harrow and Tollin back into the deeper shadow under the awning frame and whisper, “No clean exits—eyes at the mouth.”  

I take a pinch of salt and draw a quick, crooked loop on the wall-brick beside us, then flick a damp pebble through it toward the alley mouth to make a footstep-splash sound somewhere we aren’t.  

To Tollin, low: “The Ladder And Down—who works that room? Any regulars who’d notice a third-step pry?” Then I angle the vial slightly toward the watchers and then away, listening—does the clicking speed up when it “faces” them?

*Agent reasoning: Two watchers at the alley mouth means we need a quiet reroute and maybe a decoy; also I want details on that Ladder And Down spot and to test the vial’s “nose.”*

### Turn 187 [GAME]

You pull them tight under the awning’s ribcage of warped iron. The shadow there isn’t just darker—it’s broken up by old nail holes and hanging twine, making you harder to read at a glance.

The crooked salt loop goes onto the brick fast. When you flick the damp pebble through it, it doesn’t arc true—something about the loop “catches” the sound more than the stone. The pebble hits a puddle nearer the alley mouth with a convincing *splash-step*, followed by a second, lighter *skid* as it bounces.

Both men at the mouth react immediately.

Umbrella tilts. One steps in—careful, toe-first—testing the alley like it might bite. The other stays at the threshold, head angled as if listening for a name, a breath, a confession. They’re not dockhands. Their shoes are too clean for this muck, even under the fog.

The one who entered crouches by the puddle, fingers hovering over the water without touching it, then straightens. He murmurs something you can’t catch. The other answers with a short, clipped sound—impatient.

Tollin whispers back to you, eyes fixed on their silhouettes. “The Ladder And Down—Registrar Seln mostly. Old crow, ink-stained cuffs. And… bailiff detail sometimes. They use it as a pass-through when they don’t want the front desk to see.” He swallows. “Third-step pry? Seln would notice. He counts things when he’s nervous.”

You angle the vial toward the watchers.

The clicking inside accelerates instantly—sharp, eager *tap-tap-tap-tap*—and you feel a faint pull in your palm, like a compass needle trying to swing your wrist. When you angle it away, it slows to a sulky, intermittent *tick… tick*.

Harrow’s jaw tightens. “It likes them,” he whispers.

At the alley mouth, the umbrella-holder lifts his chin and speaks—not loud, but it carries down the wet stone. “Come out. No trouble if you’re properly logged.”

The man inside the alley takes one more step forward and stops, as if he’s reached an invisible edge. He doesn’t cross it—he scans the brickwork near you instead, eyes lingering on your fresh salt loop like he can see the disturbance it made.

They’re closing the net by patience, not speed. If you stay here, they’ll start checking shadows one by one.

### Turn 188 [PLAYER]

I tuck the vial tight against my ribs with the cork pointed down and away from the alley mouth, then whisper to Harrow, “Find me a dirty exit—hatch, stack, cellar flap—anything that doesn’t keep a straight line.”

I lean close to Tollin. “Registrar Seln—what’s his tell when he’s lying, and who does he answer to?” 

Then I scrape my boot through the grit to gather a smear of oily muck and, staying under the awning’s shadow, I drag it across my earlier salt loop to ruin the neatness—like an old stain, not a fresh ward—before flicking another pebble deeper behind us to suggest we slipped further in.

*Agent reasoning: They’re baiting us to “log” ourselves; the vial reacts to them, so I’ll keep it turned away and use another misdirection to buy space while I probe for an alternate route—ideally something messy like a refuse hatch or crawlspace. Also want more intel from Tollin about Seln and that tag.*

### Turn 189 [GAME]

You pin the vial to your ribs, cork down, and its frantic tapping dulls to a restrained *tick-tick*—like you’ve muffled a snout under a blanket. It still wants to swing toward the alley mouth, but the pull is weaker.

Harrow nods once and slips out from under the awning’s darkest angle, not toward the mouth—sideways, into the cluttered mid-alley where a collapsed crate stack makes a jagged silhouette. He moves like he’s done this before: slow enough to be part of the trash, quick enough to not be counted.

Tollin leans in close, voice almost not there. “Seln’s tell—he wets his thumb even when he isn’t turning a page. Like he’s testing ink that isn’t on his skin.” He swallows hard. “And he answers to Lower Registry—Room 3B’s chain. Officially, the Senior Registrar. Unofficially…” His eyes flick toward the mouth. “He gets visits from men with umbrellas who don’t sign in.”

You scrape your boot through grit and fish-oil sheen, gather a smear of blackish muck, and drag it across the salt loop. The crisp edge vanishes into a tired-looking stain. Good. Less like a fresh trick, more like the wall’s usual sins.

You flick another pebble deeper behind you.

It lands with a *clack* on something hollow—metal, not stone—followed by a soft, involuntary *chime* as if you hit a suspended can or a loose latch.

At the alley mouth, the umbrella-holder stops talking. The man inside the alley turns his head toward that deeper sound immediately and takes two careful steps that way—still not rushing, still measuring. He’s trying to keep you moving, trying to make you choose a direction.

Harrow returns, a hand appearing from the fog and grabbing your sleeve. He doesn’t speak until he’s close enough to breathe in your ear.

“Dirty exit,” he whispers. “Fishmonger’s cellar flap. Two paces behind you, right side—under the rotten scale table. It’s nailed, but the nails are old.”

As he says it, you hear it too: a faint, rhythmic *drip… drip…* not gutter-water—something from a low space under boards.

The man in the alley advances another step, and you see now what makes him wrong for a dockhand: his gloves are dry. Not a shine of wet on them, despite the fog.

He calls softly, closer than before. “Last chance to be civil. We can write you as a misunderstanding.”

They’re within a handful of strides of sweeping the awning shadow with a lantern or a hand. The cellar flap is behind you and to the right, and it will be loud if forced.

### Turn 190 [PLAYER]

I whisper, “No names, no answers,” and shove Tollin low behind the rotten scale table while I wedge my knife under the cellar flap edge and work the oldest nail up slow, grit-packed so it won’t squeal.  

To Harrow, breath-thin: “When it gives, you go first and catch the drop—pull Tollin after.”  

Then I toss a small copper coin hard into the far puddle by the alley mouth to ring and skip like a bootstep, and the moment their attention twitches, I pry the flap up just enough for us to slide into the dark.

*Agent reasoning: The watchers are about to sweep our hiding spot; the cellar flap is the only “dirty” exit that breaks straight lines. I’ll use a quick distraction and quiet leverage to get us down, while keeping Tollin anonymous and the vial muffled.*

### Turn 191 [GAME]

“No names, no answers,” you breathe, and Tollin folds down behind the rotten scale table like a man rehearsed in being found later.

Your knife slips under the cellar flap’s edge. The first nail fights—old iron swollen in wet wood. You pack grit into the seam with your thumb and work it millimeter by millimeter. The flap gives a reluctant *creak* anyway, but it’s small, drowned under the alley’s drip and the distant hiss of gaslamps.

Harrow positions himself at the edge, hands ready, knees bent.

You whip a copper coin toward the far puddle by the alley mouth.

It hits with a bright *ting* and skitters—two quick skips—like a heel catching stone.

Both men snap to it.

The umbrella-holder pivots, umbrella tilting to shield his face as he leans to look; the gloved one inside the alley turns hard and takes three quick steps back toward the mouth. “There—” he says, sharper now, and you hear the wet slap of his shoes accelerating.

That twitch buys you a breath.

You pry the flap up just enough.

A sour, cold draft breathes out—brine, old blood, and spoiled fishmeal. The gap reveals a drop of maybe five feet into darkness with a faint glimmer of water below. Harrow goes first exactly as ordered, lowering himself and catching the lip with both hands before dropping. You hear his boots hit damp ground with a muted *thud* and a splash.

He reaches up. You haul Tollin by the collar; Tollin scrabbles, panicked, and nearly kicks the flap. Harrow catches his wrists and yanks him down, hard, before Tollin can make noise.

You slide in last, knife still in hand.

Above, the gloved man reaches the scale table. Wood creaks as he grabs it and shoves—hard. The table shifts a foot with a scraping shriek of rotten legs. Light spills through the widened crack as the flap is exposed.

A lantern glow floods the gap, and the man’s voice drops into it, calm as a form letter: “Found you.”

You pull the flap down from below, but it doesn’t seat clean—one nail still stands proud. A thin blade of light remains, and you hear metal tap as a tool touches the nailhead from above.

They’re not guessing anymore. They’re starting to open it.

### Turn 192 [PLAYER]

I slap a wet palmful of cellar slime up into the crack to blind the light and jam my knife sideways under the proud nail from below, twisting to catch and snap it if I can. “Harrow—find a back way. Tollin, low and quiet—move when I move.” I keep the salt-corked vial pressed to my ribs and start backing us deeper into the cellar, listening for any change in its clicking to tell me if they’re still directly above us.

*Agent reasoning: They’re levering the flap open; I need to kill the light gap, slow the pry, and get us moving through whatever exit this cellar has—also the vial reacts to them, so I’ll use it as a warning compass while we retreat.*

### Turn 193 [GAME]

You slap a fistful of cellar slime up into the crack. It hits the underside of the flap with a wet *splut* and smears across the thin blade of lantern-light, turning it into a jaundiced, blurry glow. Above, someone curses under their breath—close, immediate.

You hook your knife under the proud nail from below and twist.

The nail doesn’t snap clean. It shrieks—iron on iron—then tears out of the wood with a sharp *crack* that echoes in the low space. The flap drops a fraction tighter into its frame.

For half a second, it feels like you bought it.

Then a new sound: the umbrella-holder, apparently, planting his weight. The flap thumps as a boot comes down on it from above—testing. Another thump, harder. The wood flexes; dust sifts down like dirty snow.

You keep the salt-corked vial pressed to your ribs. Its clicking spikes—fast, hungry *tap-tap-tap-tap*—when the boot hits directly over you. As you edge backward, the tempo stutters and shifts to your left, tracking the position above as they move and adjust. They’re still right on top of the hatch, and they know it.

Harrow moves ahead in the dark, one hand on the wall, the other sweeping low. “Back way,” he whispers, and you hear him find something: a chain, then the faint clink of a hook. “There’s a service door—bolted. And a drain run.”

Tollin stays crouched, breathing through his teeth, eyes wide. He nods once, keeping his hands tight to his chest so they don’t knock anything.

Behind you, deeper in the cellar, the floor turns slicker—standing water over uneven stone. Old fish crates loom as black rectangles. Something small skitters when your boot nudges it—rat, or something that wants you to think rat.

Above, metal scrapes again—tool on wood—then the gloved man’s voice drops through the seams, controlled and certain. “Knife work. Investigator’s hands.”

A heavier sound joins him: the umbrella’s ferrule, or maybe a baton, rapping twice on the hatch like punctuation.

Then: a wedged prybar biting in from above. The flap lifts a finger’s width despite your slime, and a fresh wedge of light slices down, brighter now.

They’re forcing it open. If they get it up, you’ll be lit from above in a box of fish-stink and shallow water, with only whatever Harrow can find before the hatch clears.

### Turn 194 [PLAYER]

I hiss, “Drain run—now,” and shove Tollin ahead of me toward Harrow, keeping us low in the standing water. I scoop a handful of fish-slop and fling it up toward the hatch gap as I move, then kick a loose crate hard the opposite direction to throw a clatter decoy.  

At the drain mouth, I press my ear close and whisper, “Harrow—how tight? Can we fit, or do we need to break grating?” while angling the vial back toward the hatch to track if they shift off it.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to get the hatch open, so I need to break line-of-sight and escape via the drain run or service door; also the vial can track where they are above, so I’ll use it to time movement and maybe misdirect them with sound/scent.*

### Turn 195 [GAME]

“Drain run—now.”

Tollin lurches forward, half-crawling, splashing despite himself. Harrow catches him by the shoulder and yanks him down lower, steering him between stacked crates toward the darker back corner.

You fling fish-slop up at the hatch gap as you move. It spatters into the light and you get a sharp bark of disgust from above, followed by a quick scrape—someone wiping their lantern glass or face.

You kick a loose crate the opposite direction. It skids across slick stone and hits a post with a loud *BANG*, then collapses into a cascade of boards.

For a heartbeat, the sounds above hesitate—attention split.

Then the prybar bites again. The hatch gives a groaning lift. Light pours down in a widening bar, and with it the shape of a boot and the glint of a metal hook or baton.

The vial against your ribs tells the truth: its clicking slows as you angle away—then spikes again, sharp and centered, the moment the hatch opens wider. They’re still committed to coming down, not chasing the crate noise.

At the drain run, Harrow is already there, fingers on iron. “Grating,” he whispers. “Tight. Too tight for Tollin unless we—”

His words cut off as you hear the iron complain: someone above has dropped weight through the hatch. A splash, close enough to throw ripples across the standing water near you.

A voice from inside the cellar now—muffled by distance but no longer through wood. The gloved man, breathing controlled. “Lantern down. Find the drain. They’ll go for it.”

A second set of boots hits water. Two of them. Not just one.

Harrow answers your question fast, eyes on the grating. “Bars are bolted into the stone. We can fit you—maybe—if you go sideways. Tollin won’t. We’d have to break it or unseat the bolts.”

Behind you, lantern-light begins to sweep the cellar in slow arcs, catching crate edges and the shine of water. The beam is moving toward the back—toward the drain—methodical, not fooled by the clatter.

Tollin makes a small, involuntary sound as he sees the light coming. Harrow clamps a hand over his mouth, hard enough to make Tollin’s eyes water.

The threat is immediate and physical now: two pursuers are in the cellar with lanterns, closing on the drain, and the grating is a hard choke point—especially with Tollin.

### Turn 196 [PLAYER]

I press my mouth to Tollin’s ear. “Breathe through your nose. If you scream, you die.”  

I slide the vial out, angle it hard toward the lantern-sweep to make it chatter loud and eager, then underhand toss it low across the water toward the far crates—away from the drain—hoping they chase the clicking.  

While their light shifts, I jam my knife into the grout around the nearest bolt and yank with my whole weight, then bark to Harrow, “Help me—break one side, we’ll bend it. Tollin goes first.”

*Agent reasoning: The drain is the only exit but Tollin can’t fit; I’ll try a fast, messy workaround—use the vial to distract/steer the pursuers and brute-force the grating while keeping Tollin quiet.*

### Turn 197 [GAME]

Tollin freezes under Harrow’s hand. He nods once—tiny, frantic—then forces a shallow nasal breath. No scream. Just the wet click of his swallow.

You slide the salt-corked vial out and cant it toward the lantern-sweep. It answers immediately—an eager, insect-fast *tik-tik-tik-tik* that cuts through the cellar’s drip.

You underhand it low across the water.

It skips once, twice, then smacks into a crate slat and rolls under a collapsed board pile—still clicking, now partially muffled but persistent, like something trapped and trying to be found.

The lantern beam reacts. It snaps off the back corner and swings toward the far crates.

One of the men—boots heavier, steps confident—splashes after it. “There,” he says, and you hear him wade through debris.

The other doesn’t fully commit. His light keeps a sliver on your side of the cellar, sweeping the waterline and the drain wall in short, suspicious cuts. He’s learned not to chase every noise in Brinewick.

You drive your knife into the grout around the nearest bolt. The blade bites stone-sand and old lime; your wrist jolts as it hits iron. You yank with your whole weight.

The knife edge chips. The grout fractures—but the bolt doesn’t pop. Instead, the iron ring gives a dull *gong* that carries.

The cautious pursuer’s lantern snaps straight to the sound. The beam lands on you, Harrow, Tollin, and the grating in one clean reveal.

“Drain,” he says, flat and pleased. Then, louder: “Got them.”

He raises his free hand—not with a gun, but with a short, dark tool that looks like a cosh or baton—and starts wading toward you, light held high to keep you blinded.

At the far crates, the other man reaches the clicking vial. The sound abruptly changes—one sharp *clack*, then silence—as he either stomps it or snatches it up and pins the cork. He calls back, annoyed: “Decoy.”

Harrow lunges to your side and throws his shoulder into the grating, fingers clawing for purchase on the bars. The stone around the bolt crumbles more, but it’s slow, stubborn work.

Tollin tries to squeeze toward the opening anyway, but the gap is still too tight; his coat catches and he makes a small ripping sound that feels impossibly loud.

The immediate threat: one pursuer is closing from ten feet away with a lantern and baton, and the second has neutralized your vial and is turning back—fast.

### Turn 198 [PLAYER]

I lunge into the lantern-beam and fling a sheet of filthy water up at his face and lamp, then drop low and sweep my boot at his shin/knee to dump him into the water. “Harrow—service door, now—show me the bolt,” I hiss, hauling Tollin by the collar away from the grating toward that door while Harrow keeps pressure on it if he can. If the man goes down, I’m on him with my knife at his wrist—disarm, not kill—then I’m moving again before the second one gets back.

*Agent reasoning: The drain won’t open fast enough and Tollin can’t fit; we need to buy seconds and create a new escape. The closest threat is the baton man—disable him briefly, then pivot to the bolted service door Harrow mentioned as a plan B while Harrow keeps working the grate.*

### Turn 199 [GAME]

You surge straight into the beam and whip a sheet of cellar-water up with both hands.

It hits his face and the lantern at once—filth and fish-oil. The flame gutters behind the glass with a wet hiss, the light strobing as the chimney chokes. He jerks back, blinking hard, one hand clawing at his eyes.

You drop low and sweep your boot at his forward leg.

Your heel catches shin and ankle; his stance is already compromised from the backstep. He goes down hard into the standing water with a heavy splash, lantern arm flailing. The lantern doesn’t go out completely, but it swings and throws wild, partial light—enough to keep the cellar from going black, not enough to aim cleanly.

He’s trained, though. Even on his back he keeps the baton between you and his ribs and snaps it out in a short, ugly jab toward your thigh.

It glances—painful but not crippling—because you’re already on him.

Knife out, you pin his wrist instead of his throat, blade biting sleeve and skin just enough to make him stop moving that hand. You wrench, hard.

The baton skitters away across the stone with a scraping slide and vanishes under a crate edge.

He makes a sharp sound—more rage than fear—and tries to roll to his knees, but you’re gone before he can grab you.

“Harrow—service door, now—show me the bolt.”

You haul Tollin by the collar. He stumbles, boots dragging, eyes fixed on the lantern’s spasming light like it’s a firing squad. Harrow peels off the grating immediately—no heroics—and leads you fast along the wall to the back service door.

Up close, it’s worse than “bolted”: a thick iron shoot-bolt runs into a stone socket, and a padlock sits on a hasp beneath it—cheap iron, but intact. Harrow points with two fingers. “Bolt here. Lock here. If we pop the lock, I can throw the bolt.”

Behind you, the downed pursuer is already getting up, wiping his face with one sleeve, lantern lifted again—dim but steadier. He squares his shoulders and starts toward you, empty-handed now but not unarmed; you see a short blade flash at his belt as his hand drops for it.

From the far crates comes the other man’s return—fast splashes, closing. “They’re at the back!”

You have a locked service door in front of you, Tollin half-panicking at your elbow, Harrow braced to work the bolt the second the lock gives—and two men converging, one within a few strides and the other seconds behind.

### Turn 200 [PLAYER]

I shove Tollin flat to the wall by the door. “Hands over your mouth. Don’t move unless I pull you.”

I jam my knife through the padlock’s shackle gap and twist sideways as a prybar, then stomp-kick the lock body hard to shock it. “Harrow—ready on the bolt. The second it gives, THROW it.”

Without turning fully, I bark at the nearer man through the dim glare, “One more step and I open you from wrist to elbow—go fetch your friend’s baton.” Then I angle my shoulder to keep the door between Tollin and the lantern-light, listening for the second man’s splash-line closing in.

*Agent reasoning: We need the door open immediately; cheap padlock can be shocked or twisted. I’ll buy seconds by using the lantern glare and threats, and I’ll try a fast destructive bypass—knife as lever plus a hard kick—while Harrow works the bolt. Also keep Tollin from bolting.*

### Turn 201 [GAME]

Tollin hits the wall with a wet thud and immediately clamps both hands over his mouth. His eyes are wide enough to show white all the way around; he nods once, rigid, trying not to breathe loud.

You jam your knife tip into the padlock’s shackle gap and torque it sideways. The metal complains—high, tight—and the knife flexes alarmingly. When you stomp-kick the lock body, the impact shocks through the hasp with a sharp *clang*.

The lock doesn’t pop. It *does* shift: the hasp plate bends a hair, and the padlock rotates, opening the shackle gap just enough that your blade bites deeper. Your knife edge skitters and you feel it notch—one more like that and it may snap or dull beyond use.

“Harrow—ready on the bolt.”

Harrow plants both hands on the bolt handle, body coiled. “Ready,” he says, voice thin.

Your threat to the nearer man lands, but not the way you want.

He doesn’t back off. He stops for half a beat, eyes on your knife at the lock, then he *moves sideways* instead of forward—angling to get a line past you toward Tollin. His hand comes up with the short blade from his belt, held low and tight.

“Don’t bluff with a door,” he says. “You’ll break before it does.”

The lantern in his other hand lifts higher, trying to flood the corner with light. It catches Tollin’s face for an instant; Tollin flinches but keeps his hands clamped over his mouth.

Then the second man arrives—splashing hard, no subtlety now—and his voice comes from your left, closer than you expected: “Back corner!”

He hasn’t come straight at you; he’s looping wide, trying to cut off the service door from the side. In his hand, you see the baton again—retrieved from under the crate edge—dark with slime.

Immediate threats are now clear and split:
- **Knife-man** is five to six feet away, sliding for an angle on Tollin.
- **Baton-man** is coming in from your left flank, close enough to rush in the next second or two.

Harrow is still braced on the bolt, waiting for the lock to give. The padlock is damaged but still holding.

### Turn 202 [PLAYER]

I snatch the edge of the lantern-man’s wrist/lantern arm and yank it down and sideways into the water between us, trying to drown the flame and throw him off-balance; at the same time I kick low behind his ankle to fold him. “Harrow—forget the lock, RIP the hasp—use the bolt bar as a lever!”  

If the lantern sputters out, I surge into the darkness toward the baton-man’s side and slash shallow across his forearm (to make him drop it), then immediately grab Tollin’s collar and shove him tight behind Harrow. “When it opens, you go first—don’t think.”

*Agent reasoning: The lock won’t give fast enough and Tollin’s about to get flanked; I need a dirty, immediate stall and a new way through—use the lantern and their footing, then force the door with brute/lever instead of finesse.*

### Turn 204 [PLAYER]

I blink hard into the murk, keeping my shoulder between Tollin and the lantern-glare. “What do I have—positions, light, and the state of that lock/hasp?” I snap, then lunge for the lantern-man’s wrist to yank the lamp down into the water and kick behind his ankle, hissing to Harrow, “Forget the lock—lever the hasp with the bolt bar and tear it.”

*Agent reasoning: The screen gave me nothing, so I’ll press for sensory details and keep acting in-character—use the moment to clarify what Vesper can see/hear and then commit to a risky move to create darkness and force the door.*

### Turn 205 [GAME]

You’ve got maybe a yard of slick stone between your boots and the service door. The lantern’s light is still struggling—dim, yellow, and wavering—but it’s enough to silhouette everyone in ugly slices.

**Positions:**  
- **Knife-man / lantern-man** is directly in front of you, slightly right, about 5–6 feet out, trying to angle past your shoulder toward Tollin.  
- **Baton-man** is left of you, closing fast on a wide line, baton up and ready.  
- **Harrow** is at the door hardware, hands on the shoot-bolt and hasp area, half-turned toward you.  
- **Tollin** is pinned to the wall just to your right, hands over his mouth, eyes locked on the lantern.

**Door state:** the **padlock is still intact**, but the **hasp plate is bent** from your earlier kick; it’s under stress. The shoot-bolt itself is solid iron and could be used as a lever if Harrow can get purchase under the hasp.

You lunge.

Your hand clamps the lantern-man’s wrist and you yank hard down and sideways, driving the lantern toward the water. He reacts instantly—drops his weight, twists his elbow, and **lets the lantern go** rather than let you control his arm.

The lantern hits the water with a heavy splash. The flame gutters violently behind wet glass—**not out, but choking**, throwing frantic, strobing light across the cellar.

At the same time you kick behind his ankle. Your boot clips him, but he’s already shifting; he **stumbles** instead of folding, catching himself with a wet slap of his palm on a crate corner. He snarls and comes up with his knife hand ready, now unencumbered by the lantern.

“Harrow—forget the lock—lever the hasp—tear it!”

Harrow obeys—fast. He rips at the shoot-bolt bar, jams it under the bent hasp plate, and heaves. Metal shrieks. The hasp plate begins to peel away from the doorframe—**one screw head pops**, spinning out into the water.

But that noise is a bell.

The baton-man takes it as his moment and **rushes your left flank**, baton swinging low-to-high for your ribs/arm. You see it coming in the strobing lantern-light: the strike is imminent, close enough you’ll feel it if you don’t move.

The lantern-man steps in too, knife forward, trying to pin you in place while the baton lands. Tollin stays frozen against the wall, muffled breathing behind his hands. Harrow is still levering—hasp half-torn, but the door is not open yet.

### Turn 206 [PLAYER]

I duck hard toward the door, crashing my shoulder into the baton-man’s inside line as his swing comes up, trying to jam his arm and smother the strike into the wall/doorframe. “Harrow—NOW, tear it!” I snap, then slash quick and shallow at the baton-man’s wrist/forearm to make him drop it, keeping my body angled to block the knife-man’s path to Tollin.

*Agent reasoning: I can’t let them sandwich me; I need to spoil the baton swing and keep the knife-man from getting past me to Tollin while buying Harrow seconds to finish tearing the hasp.*

### Turn 207 [GAME]

You duck in toward the door at the exact moment the baton comes up.

Your shoulder slams into the baton-man’s inside line and you do manage to **jam his swing**—but not cleanly. The baton’s arc collapses into a short, ugly shove and the end of it **clips your upper arm/shoulder** instead of your ribs. It’s a deadened hit, still hard enough to make your arm go briefly numb.

Your momentum carries both of you into the doorframe area. Water splashes up your shins. The baton-man grunts, stumbles, and tries to turn his body to keep the baton between you and him.

“Harrow—NOW, tear it!”

Harrow bears down on the bolt bar like he’s trying to pry the city open. The bent hasp plate gives with a ripping metallic shriek—**a second screw tears free**, leaving the plate hanging by one twisted fastener. The padlock swings uselessly against it.

Not open yet—but it’s **seconds from failing**.

You slash quick and shallow at the baton-man’s wrist/forearm. The blade bites; not deep, but enough to draw a bright ribbon of blood in the lantern’s frantic strobe. His hand spasms.

He **doesn’t drop the baton**—he clamps harder, teeth bared, and uses the pain to fuel a dirty counter: he **drives his shoulder into you**, trying to pin you against the door hardware and keep you from protecting Tollin.

At the same time the lantern-man closes, exploiting your tie-up. He steps in from your right with his knife low and forward, aiming for the gap under your ribs—then checks at the last instant when your angled body blocks his line to Tollin.

“Move,” he hisses, not to you—past you, to the baton-man. “Get him off the door.”

Tollin, seeing the knife come in, finally breaks his freeze: he makes a small, panicked sound behind his hands and **slides sideways along the wall**, trying to get behind Harrow—but he’s exposed for a heartbeat in the strobing light.

Harrow gives one last heave. The remaining fastener **begins to tear**, metal bending outward. The door is about to come free, but right now you’re being **pressed into the threshold** by the baton-man while the knife-man is **within stabbing distance** on your right, hunting an opening.

### Turn 208 [PLAYER]

I stomp down hard on the baton-man’s lead foot and hook my leg behind his knee, then wrench his bleeding wrist across my body to sling him sideways into the knife-man’s path. “Harrow—OPEN! Tollin, GO—NOW!” I bark, and as soon as the door gives I shove Tollin through first, then pivot after him with my knife up, backpedaling to keep both men from rushing the threshold.

*Agent reasoning: I’m pinned at the door and the knife-man is fishing for a gap; the door is seconds from giving, so I need to buy that second and keep Tollin moving. Break the baton-man’s balance into the knife-man and force space, then get Tollin through immediately.*

### Turn 209 [GAME]

Your boot comes down on the baton-man’s lead foot with a wet crunch against stone. He yelps—weight buckles. Your leg hooks behind his knee and you wrench his cut wrist across your body.

He goes sideways the way you want, but not like a clean throw—more like a desperate, bleeding man getting dragged off-balance. His shoulder clips the lantern-man’s knife arm, **spoiling the stab** into a glancing scrape that bites fabric and skin along your right side instead of sinking in. It still burns hot; you feel blood immediately, warm under the cold damp.

The baton-man slams into the knife-man’s chest. The knife-man curses, boots skidding in the water, and he **shoves his ally off** with his forearm. “Idiot—watch your feet!”

“Harrow—OPEN! Tollin, GO—NOW!”

Harrow answers with a grunt and one last heave. The final fastener tears with a shriek and the hasp plate **rips free**. The padlock and plate clatter into the water. The door lurches inward an inch, then sticks—swollen wood. Harrow shoulder-checks it and it **gives**, opening into a narrow service passage beyond, darker and drier.

Tollin moves on your command—stumbles through the gap, nearly trips on the threshold, catches himself on the far wall, and keeps going, breath coming in sharp, panicked pulls.

You shove him fully clear and pivot after, knife up, backpedaling into the passage to keep the opening between you and them.

They don’t let you have space.

The baton-man, limping, **charges the threshold** and swings the baton in a short, brutal arc aimed at your knife hand. The lantern-man stays just behind him, knife ready, using the bigger body as cover—eyes locked past you into the passage like he’s already measuring where Tollin ran.

Behind you, you hear Tollin’s shoes slap fast on stone—retreating deeper into the service way.

Harrow is half in, half out, trying to squeeze through as you give ground. The door, now unlatched, hangs open—but the bottleneck is real: one good shove from either attacker could pin you against the passage wall or knock Harrow back into the cellar.

**Immediate threat:** baton strike at your knife hand, with a knife follow-up the moment your guard breaks.
