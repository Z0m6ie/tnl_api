### Turn 4 [PLAYER]

Dr. Elara Voss was once a celebrated xenoneurologist until her research vessel vanished into a derelict cathedral-ship drifting beyond mapped space, returning years later with only her and a chorus of unexplained whispers. Now she serves as the ship’s unwilling “confessor,” translating the alien psalms that seep through its rusted halls and into human minds. She is austere, fiercely compassionate, and quietly self-destructive, carrying grief like a sacrament. Elara’s private mission is to locate the fragment of her lost lover’s consciousness she believes is entombed in the ship’s living circuitry—even if freeing it means damning everyone still aboard.

### Turn 5 [GAME]

Here's your character:

**Dr. Elara Voss**
*Xenoneurologist and unwilling ship-confessor (translator of alien psalms and mental contagions)*

Once a celebrated xenoneurologist in the Outer Concord, Elara disappeared when her research vessel was swallowed by a derelict cathedral-ship drifting beyond mapped space. Years later the vessel returned without explanation, carrying only Elara—changed, half-starved, and followed by a constant chorus of whispers that speak in alien psalms. Now she lives aboard the cathedral-ship, translating its hymns while mourning the lover she believes was absorbed into its living circuitry.

**Traits:** Austere and disciplined, Fiercely compassionate, Quietly self-destructive, Haunted and hypervigilant, Morally resolute to a fault
**Goal:** To locate and extract the fragment of her lost lover’s consciousness entombed within the cathedral-ship’s living circuitry, even if the act unleashes the psalms fully and condemns everyone still aboard.

### Turn 9 [GAME]

**PLACE & TIME**  
You stand in **Transept Dock C-7**, where the Outer Concord relief module bites into the cathedral-ship’s wounded flank. It’s past midnight; the ship’s “day” lights never fully wake. Cold incense—ozone and old wax—hangs in the air, and frost pearls along the quarantine pylon cables you helped bolt down.

**CHARACTER IN SCENE**  
You run a handheld scanner along Pylon Three’s seam and watch the psalm-intercept graph stutter. Your badge reads *quarantine tech*, but your hands move like someone trained to listen for patterns: levels, harmonics, repeats. You tap the pylon housing twice—an old field habit—then pull the audio buffer and route it to your earpiece.

**THE HOOK**  
A door at the end of the transept corridor seals with a soft thunk, cutting off two Concord medics mid-argument. The bulkhead display flashes **LAMENT ROUTE ACTIVE**, a Candle-Synod override you weren’t supposed to see. A pilgrim in gray wax-cloth slips through before the seal completes and hurries toward you, breath steaming. Their palms are stained with candle soot, and they press a **wax-sealed memory-vial** into your hand like contraband. “Give this to Dr. Voss,” they say, voice tight. “Tell her the ship keeps lovers as organs.”

Before you can answer, your pylon feed chirps—an alert you didn’t program. The intercept spikes, then resolves into a clean, human cadence under the choir’s scrape. It speaks a name you were told never to write down. The timestamp on the log is wrong by six minutes: the response came **before** any new translation was uploaded.

A Concord security attaché strides in, helmet under one arm, and points at the sealed corridor. “Filters are venting again,” they snap. “We’re cutting through to the nave. Now. You’re coming—your pylons will guide us.”

**THE MOMENT**  
In one hand you have the memory-vial meant for Elara; in the other, a live pylon log proving the lover-fragment is answering early. The sealed corridor holds your trapped medics on the far side. The attaché waits for your confirmation.

### Turn 10 [PLAYER]

I slip the wax-sealed vial into the inner pocket of my coat and mute my earpiece with a thumb. To the attaché I say, low and clipped: “I’ll guide you, but we open that corridor first—two medics are sealed in, and I’m not adding bodies to your venting report.” I step to Pylon Three’s housing, pretending routine maintenance as I start a private copy of the pylon log to my personal buffer, then glance at the bulkhead display. “How are you cutting through—Synod codes, or brute?”

*Agent reasoning: The memory-vial and the early-answer log feel like the first real proof my lover is still in the ship; I can’t hand either to security. But leaving the medics sealed in is a death sentence, and I can use the attaché’s urgency as cover to get closer to the nave while keeping control of the data.*

### Turn 11 [GAME]

The memory-vial slides into your inner pocket with a soft clink against your ribs—warm from the pilgrim’s hand, already cooling fast. When you mute your earpiece, the corridor’s ambient choir drops to a dull vibration in your jaw.

The attaché clocks the pocketing motion anyway. Their eyes flick down, then back up—filed, not challenged. “Noted,” they say to your demand about the medics, but their thumb is already on their wrist unit.

You pop Pylon Three’s lower service panel. The inside is rimed with frost that shouldn’t be there; it flakes off in dry, papery curls. You jack a lead from the pylon’s maintenance port into your personal buffer and start a copy. The progress bar crawls—then hesitates, like it’s being *read back* as you pull it. Your buffer pings a warning: **UNAUTHORIZED MIRROR REQUEST**. Something on the network is trying to duplicate what you’re duplicating.

Over your shoulder the bulkhead display cycles: **LAMENT ROUTE ACTIVE / ACCESS DENIED (CANDLE-SYNOD)**. The sealed door at the corridor’s end gives a second, smaller lock sound—an internal deadbolt engaging. The two trapped medics are now fully isolated.

The attaché answers your question without looking away from the door. “Synod codes don’t exist,” they say. “Only people who think they do.” They nod to two Concord engineers who jog in with a compact cutter rig and a canister of expanding sealant. “We go brute. We patch after.”

One of the engineers plants a hand on the door seam—and jerks back. Their palm comes away with a faint, wet sheen. Not blood. Condensation that smells like burnt copper.

From behind the sealed door, a muffled voice—one of your medics—shouts something you can’t make out. Then a second sound, closer to the metal: fingernails scraping in a pattern that isn’t panic. Three short, one long. Like a knock you recognize from pylon diagnostics.

Your private copy hits 38%. The mirror request persists, patient and hungry.

The attaché finally looks at you. “Guide us,” they say, “or step aside. Either way, that door opens in sixty seconds.”

```

### Turn 12 [PLAYER]

I snatch the lead free and kill the transfer at 38%, then flip my buffer to offline—no more mirroring. I step to the sealed door, press my ear to the cold metal, and tap back the same pattern—three short, one long—soft but precise. “Medic,” I call, “answer with your name and status—are you alone in there?”

*Agent reasoning: The mirror request feels like the ship trying to steal or corrupt the log; I need to stop the leak and prioritize the medics before brute force turns them into collateral. The knock pattern suggests the pylon can “speak” to the lock—if I can answer it, I might bypass without cutting.*

### Turn 13 [GAME]

The moment you yank the lead free, the pylon’s maintenance port sparks—a tiny blue snap—and the frost inside the housing recoils in a thin ring as if heat passed through it. Your buffer drops the transfer cleanly at **38%**. When you flip it to offline, the **UNAUTHORIZED MIRROR REQUEST** warning vanishes… but the pylon itself gives a soft, almost satisfied click, like a relay seating.

You cross to the sealed corridor door. The metal is so cold it stings through your hairline when you press your ear to it. Your breath fogs and immediately crystals over.

You tap: three short, one long.

For half a second there’s nothing.

Then the same pattern comes back—too perfect, too evenly spaced, as if timed by a machine rather than a shaking hand.

You call out. “Medic. Answer with your name and status—are you alone in there?”

A voice answers close to the door, muffled but distinct. Not one of the medics’ voices you heard earlier arguing. Younger. Calm in the wrong way.

“**Medic Sera Lint.** Status: breathing. Not bleeding. Not… alone.”

There’s a pause, and you hear a second sound behind the door: a wet drag across the deck, followed by a soft chime like a monitor alarm being silenced.

Sera speaks again, quieter. “There’s someone in here who isn’t on my roster. They’re wearing a Concord mask, but the mask is… frosted shut. They won’t answer me. They keep tapping the door like you did.”

Behind you, the attaché makes a sharp hand signal. One engineer shoulders the cutter rig into position; the other readies the expanding sealant. The cutter’s pilot light flares.

The attaché leans in toward you, voice flat. “That’s not one of ours. Step back.”

The cutter teeth kiss the door seam with a high, thin whine—then the sound warps, bending into a faint harmonic that matches the corridor’s distant choir. Frost blooms outward from the cut line in branching, fast-growing veins.

On the far side of the door, Sera suddenly hisses, urgent. “Don’t—when you cut it, it *sings*. It’s turning its head toward—”

A hard thump hits the inside of the door, right where your ear was a moment ago, as if something leaned into it from the other side. The metal flexes inward a few millimeters and holds, trembling.

The threat is immediate and clear: **forcing the door will trigger the ship’s psalm-response (“it sings”), and there is an unknown masked presence inside with the trapped medics—moving and interacting with the door.**

### Turn 14 [PLAYER]

I grab the cutter rig by its shoulder bar and shove it down an inch, hard. “Stop. You’re tuning the damn door.” I look at the attaché. “Give me thirty seconds—if it sings, we lose them and maybe the whole transept.”

I press my mouth to the seam and speak to Sera, steady. “Sera, keep your back to a corner. Tell me where the other medic is—alive? And do not touch the masked one.” Then, without waiting for permission, I pivot to the bulkhead display and bark at the nearest engineer: “Show me the LAMENT route junction—where does this seal report to? I need the closest manual node, now.”

*Agent reasoning: Cutting will “sing” and escalate whatever is inside; I need to stall the brute breach, get eyes on the LAMENT route, and try a quieter override while keeping Sera anchored and responsive.*

### Turn 15 [GAME]

Your shove knocks the cutter’s teeth off the seam with a screech. The pilot whine collapses, and the frost-veins stop advancing—leaving a pale, branching scar in the metal like a half-finished sigil.

The engineer you shoved stumbles, catches the rig, then turns on you with a glare that says *assault*—but the attaché’s hand comes up, two fingers down. Stand down. For now.

“Thirty,” the attaché says, voice tight. “Then I open it my way.”

You press your mouth to the seam. The metal burns cold against your lip.

On the other side, Sera answers immediately—breathing hard now, trying not to let it shake her words. “Other medic is **Tomas**. He’s— he’s alive. He’s on the deck by the inner lock, conscious but… not talking. He keeps staring at the frosted mask like he knows it.”

A dull scrape: something shifting its weight.

Sera continues, lower. “The masked one is standing between us and the door. It’s facing you. It’s tapping in time with the ship. Every time it taps, Tomas flinches like he’s hearing it inside his teeth.”

You pivot to the bulkhead display. The nearest engineer—older, hands stained with sealant—jabs at the interface. “LAMENT routing is not standard control,” they snap, but they pull up an overlay anyway: a schematic blooms, full of red-lit cul-de-sacs.

A node flashes three corridors away: **MANUAL SHRINE RELAY — STATION M-ALCOVE 9**. Next to it, a warning: **LOCAL ACCESS REQUIRES OFFERING / AUTHENTICATION: CANDLE-SYNOD**.

As the overlay loads, the ship reacts: the deck under your boots gives a slow, devotional pulse, and the sealed door’s internal deadbolt clicks once—*not locking* this time, but loosening. The seam exhales a thin thread of incense-cold air that smells like copper and extinguished candles.

The attaché notices the deadbolt change and misreads it as your progress. They step closer, hand going to their sidearm. “If that door opens on its own,” they say, “and it isn’t our medics who come out— I put it down. Understood?”

From behind the door: one final, perfectly timed pattern—three short, one long—followed by a new sound you haven’t heard yet.

A soft, wet *laugh*—as if someone is trying to remember how.

The threat is immediate: the door is beginning to unlatch without you cutting it, and whatever is inside is actively synchronizing with the ship’s psalm-rhythm.

### Turn 16 [PLAYER]

I snap my buffer and earpiece back on just long enough to catch the rhythm, then step between the attaché and the seam, palm up. “Holster it—if you fire into a singing threshold you’ll make a choir out of all of us.”  

I pull the wax-sealed memory-vial from my inner pocket and hold it near the seam like a candle at confession. “Sera—on my count, drag Tomas as far from the door as you can, corner, now.” Then I whisper to the door itself, “I bring an offering. I request the manual node—M-Alcove 9—open your throat the *right* way.”  

Without waiting, I pivot and stride for **Manual Shrine Relay: Station M‑Alcove 9**, barking over my shoulder to the older engineer: “Sealant ready on my mark—if it opens here, you patch fast. Attaché, you cover *me*, not the door.”

*Agent reasoning: The door is about to open and the attaché will shoot anything “wrong.” I need to buy Sera/Tomas time and interrupt the sync without escalating violence; the only leverage I have is the Synod “offering” and my own authority as Voss to control the psalm-response.*

### Turn 17 [GAME]



### Turn 18 [PLAYER]

I step between the attaché and the seam, palm up. “Holster it—if you fire into a singing threshold you’ll make a choir out of all of us.”  

I bring the wax-sealed memory-vial close to the seam like a votive. “Sera—on my count, drag Tomas to the farthest corner, now. Don’t touch the masked one.” I whisper to the door, “Offering present. Route me to Manual Shrine Relay M‑Alcove 9—open the right way.”  

Then I turn and hurry for **M‑Alcove 9**, calling back: “Sealant ready—patch on my mark. Attaché, cover *me*, not the door.”

*Agent reasoning: I can’t let them cut or shoot into that threshold; the ship responds to offerings and ritual nodes, so I’ll use the vial as leverage while moving to the manual shrine relay to reroute the seal safely.*

### Turn 19 [GAME]



### Turn 20 [PLAYER]

I step between the attaché and the seam, palm up. “Holster it—if you fire into a singing threshold you’ll make a choir out of all of us.”  

I lift the wax-sealed memory-vial to the seam like a votive. “Sera—drag Tomas to the farthest corner, now. Don’t touch the masked one.” I whisper to the door, “Offering present. Route me to Manual Shrine Relay M‑Alcove 9—open the right way.”  

Then I turn and hurry for **M‑Alcove 9**, calling back over my shoulder: “Sealant ready—patch on my mark. Attaché, cover *me*, not the door.”

*Agent reasoning: The door is synchronizing with the ship; cutting or shooting risks triggering a psalm-response. The manual shrine relay is the only nearby control point, and the memory-vial can serve as an “offering” to get access without forcing the threshold.*

### Turn 21 [GAME]



### Turn 22 [PLAYER]

I plant myself between the attaché and the seam, palm up. “Holster it. If you fire into a singing threshold you’ll make a choir out of all of us.”  

I raise the wax-sealed memory-vial to the seam like a votive. “Sera—drag Tomas to the farthest corner, now. Don’t touch the masked one.” Then, under my breath to the door: “Offering present. Route me to Manual Shrine Relay M‑Alcove 9—open the right way.”  

I turn and hurry toward **M‑Alcove 9**, calling back over my shoulder: “Sealant ready—patch on my mark. Attaché, cover *me*, not the door.”

*Agent reasoning: The screen’s blank—no new cue—so I’ll proceed with the plan: stop the attaché from shooting, make the offering, and sprint for the manual shrine relay before the door fully “sings.”*

### Turn 23 [GAME]

The attaché’s pistol hesitates a fraction too long in your peripheral vision—then he swears and yanks it down into a low-ready, finger straight. “Fine. You get one try, Doctor.”

The seam in the sealed corridor door is not smoke, not light: it’s a thin, vibrating *edge* where sound has become geometry. When you raise the wax-sealed vial to it, the wax warms instantly against your glove as if pressed to skin. The seam’s hymn changes pitch—one note slides under your teeth—and the door’s surface dimples inward a millimeter toward the vial, like something sniffing.

Sera—one of the trapped medics—doesn’t argue. You hear her scramble and drag Tomas by his harness toward the far corner. Tomas makes a wet, involuntary sound and then clamps his mouth shut. The “masked one” in the corridor (the other medic, face hidden behind a respirator hood slick with condensation) stays perfectly still, head angled toward the seam as if listening to your whisper through the metal.

You murmur your request.

The ship answers.

Not with words—by *rearranging*.

The bulkhead lights stutter, then re-thread into a line of pale candles down the cross-corridor to your left. A maintenance hatch you’ve walked past twice since docking—flush, unmarked—clicks open on its own. Cold incense breathes out of it in a steady, deliberate exhale. Stenciled on the inner frame, half-scraped by age and toolmarks, you can read: **M-ALCOVE 9**.

Behind you, the sealed door does not open. Instead, a second seam blossoms—hairline—around the latch, and a thread of frost crawls outward in branching veins. The hymn at the threshold grows louder, as if offended you didn’t pay in full.

The attaché shifts to cover your back the way you ordered, but his eyes keep flicking to the new frost. “That’s not normal seal behavior,” he says, voice tight. “That’s the ship *making a choice*.”

As you move into the hatch toward M‑Alcove 9, you catch one more concrete change: your memory-vial’s wax seal has softened and taken an imprint—four shallow grooves like fingerprints pressed from the *inside*.

Inside the access, the passage slopes down. Something in the dark ahead gives a soft, patient *click*, like a relay engaging.

```json
{"inventory_add":[],"inventory_remove":[],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":["Manual Shrine Relay M‑Alcove 9"],"npcs_add":[]}
```

### Turn 24 [PLAYER]

I glance back at the frost-threading latch and murmur, “I know. And it’s choosing *delay*.” Then I hold up the vial for the attaché to see. “No shots unless I say. If it starts harmonizing with your heartbeat, bite your tongue hard—pain breaks the loop.”

I step fully into the M‑Alcove 9 access, palm on the wall, following the candle-line, and whisper into my buffer, “Sera, status—are you both in the corner? Is the masked one still between you and the door?”

As I descend, I turn the vial under the light and trace the four grooves with my thumb. “Whose fingers are you borrowing,” I mutter to the ship, and quicken toward the relay’s click, looking for the manual node interface—lever, prayer-wheel, anything I can *physically* seize.

*Agent reasoning: The ship has accepted the offering enough to open the hatch, but the offended hymn and frost mean the threshold is still active and could escalate; I need to secure the manual relay fast while keeping the attaché from panicking, and I want to examine the vial’s “inside fingerprints” as a possible sign of my lost lover or the ship’s mimicry.*

### Turn 25 [GAME]

The attaché leans in just enough to see the softened wax and the four inner-grooves. His jaw tightens. “Copy. No shots.” He shifts his weight like he wants to argue about the tongue-biting, then just says, “Understood,” and keeps his pistol down, tracking *you* and the angles around you instead of the door.

You step fully into the M‑Alcove 9 access. The hatch closes behind you with a gentle, final click—no slam, no sealant hiss. Just *decision*. Your palm on the wall comes away faintly damp, as if the metal has been breathing.

Your buffer crackles. Sera answers in a whisper that’s trying not to become a sob. “—corner, yes. Tomas is—he’s conscious. The masked one’s still between us and the door.” A beat. “Doctor… it’s not looking at the seam anymore. It’s looking at *us*. Like it knows we’re counting on you.”

As you descend along the candle-line, the vial’s grooves catch the light: four shallow arcs, thumb, two fingers, then a smaller one—someone’s grip, impressed from within. When you trace them, the wax gives slightly, warm as skin. Under your thumb the grooves *shift* a hair, aligning to your print as if trying to match you.

Ahead, the relay click repeats—patient, metronomic. You find the manual node interface recessed into the bulkhead: a brass prayer-wheel with worn ridges, a mechanical lever beside it, and a small viewport like an eye. The viewport is fogged from the inside.

You seize the lever.

It doesn’t budge.

Not stuck—*held*, with the resistant give of something alive refusing to be moved. The prayer-wheel, though, turns freely—and as you rotate it, the click ahead changes cadence to follow your hand.

Then the viewport clears in a single breath, and you see what’s inside the relay housing: not wires, but bundled filament arranged like tendons around a central contact plate stamped with an old Concord serial.

A voice comes through the metal—not over comms, not over speakers—close enough to feel in your molars.

“Elara.”

Not the ship’s choir. One voice, singular, familiar in the way a scar is familiar.

Behind you, through the access wall, you hear a distant sound from the sealed corridor: a muffled *thud*, then Sera’s sharp intake of breath over the buffer—“Doctor— the masked one just sat down in front of the door. Like it’s… guarding it.”

The threat is immediate and concrete: the relay is responding to you, and the corridor side has gained a still, intentional sentinel between the medics and the threshold.

### Turn 26 [PLAYER]

My breath catches; I press my forehead to the cold brass and whisper, “Don’t say my name like that unless you mean it—*who* are you?”  

Into the buffer, tight and steady: “Sera, don’t move. Keep Tomas breathing slow; if the masked one twitches, you both bite down and focus on the pain—no screaming, no prayers.”  

I keep one hand on the prayer-wheel and turn it back a notch, then forward again, mapping the click’s cadence like a pulse; with the other hand I lift the vial to the viewport. “Relay—manual node—take the offering and give me the lever. Open the throat the right way.”

*Agent reasoning: That voice could be the ship baiting me, but I can’t ignore it; I need to keep Sera calm and buy time while I test the relay without surrendering myself to it.*

### Turn 27 [GAME]

Your forehead meets the brass. It is colder than the corridor metal should be—cold like vacuum, like a mouth held open too long.

“Who are you?” you whisper.

The answer comes immediately, and it does not sound like the choir. It sounds like someone speaking through clenched teeth to stop themselves shaking.

“Not him,” the voice says. “Not yours. I’m the part that learned your shape.”

Your buffer hisses as Sera obeys. “Copy,” she whispers. In the background Tomas draws a slow, ragged breath and forces the next one to match it. No one moves. Then, faintly, you hear fabric scrape—one careful shift. Sera goes rigid. “Masked one—” she starts.

“Don’t,” the masked one says, voice muffled behind the respirator hood. It’s the first time it’s spoken. “Don’t pray at it.”

Back at the relay, you turn the prayer-wheel back a notch.

The relay’s click stutters—skips a beat—then resumes, now locked to your hand like a pulse you’re dragging. Turn forward again, and the cadence tightens, more eager. The fog in the viewport beads and clears in time with your rotation.

You lift the memory-vial to the viewport.

The wax seal *gives* with a soft internal crackle, as if something inside flexed. A thread of warm scent—old paper, human sweat, scorched myrrh—leaks from the vial’s lip though the seal still looks intact. Inside the viewport, the tendon-filaments retract a fraction, exposing the central contact plate.

A small slot irises open beneath the viewport—too narrow for your hand, precisely sized for the vial.

When you present it, the slot’s edges dimple around the glass like lips. It tugs.

If you let go, it will take the vial.

The lever beside your hand loosens by a hair—no longer *held*—but it’s not free yet; it’s like a latch waiting for payment.

From deeper in the alcove, something answers your “open the throat” request with a mechanical response: two bulkhead valves cycle somewhere below, a brief wheeze of pressure equalization. The access passage behind you cools another degree. The ship is preparing a route.

Over the buffer, Sera whispers, tight with fear, “Doctor… the masked one’s turning its head. It’s listening to something I can’t hear.”

The immediate threat is clear: the relay will accept the offering and may free the lever, but taking your vial means surrendering whatever memory is sealed inside—and the masked one is now actively receiving instructions from the same system you’re bargaining with.

### Turn 28 [PLAYER]

I clamp my fingers around the vial’s neck and let the slot draw it in only to the wax line—no further—then hiss, “Taste, don’t swallow,” and twist the prayer-wheel a quarter-turn to keep the cadence under my control.  

Into the buffer: “Masked one—good. Then listen to *me*: if it tells you to open your hood or touch the seam, you refuse. Help Sera keep Tomas steady.”  

I lean close to the viewport, voice low and shaking with anger and want. “Part-that-learned-my-shape—prove you’re not him by giving me the lever *without* taking what’s sealed. Open the throat the right way, or I pull the offering and you get nothing.”

*Agent reasoning: I can’t let the ship take the whole memory—if it eats that, it owns the leverage. But Sera and Tomas are seconds from being “handled,” so I need the lever freed now; I’ll pay a controlled drop, not surrender, and use the masked one’s warning to pivot them into an ally.*

### Turn 29 [GAME]

The slot draws the vial in until the wax line meets the irised edge. The pressure is firm—testing. You hold it there.

For a heartbeat it *behaves*: the relay clicks in time with your quarter-turn, and the tendon-filaments behind the viewport lean toward the glass as if sniffing. The wax warms under the rim. A faint vibration runs up the vial’s neck into your knuckles, like a tongue tasting through teeth.

Then it tries to cheat.

The slot tightens and pulls—harder than before—an abrupt, hungry tug meant to yank the vial past your grip. Your fingers scrape against the glass; the wax seal creaks, a thin fissure spidering a millimeter along its edge. You stop it, but you feel exactly how little margin you have before the seal fails.

Inside the viewport, the central contact plate flashes a dull red, like a warning LED behind old brass. The voice returns, closer, offended.

“Payment is how throats learn,” it says. “You taught it that.”

The lever responds to your ultimatum—not by freeing, but by *locking down* with a decisive clack. Whatever give it had is gone. You can still turn the prayer-wheel, but the lever is now mechanically barred until the relay is satisfied.

Over the buffer, your instruction lands with immediate effect. The masked one exhales slowly—audible through the respirator—and shifts its body to block Sera and Tomas more fully, not threatening them, but positioning like a brace. “Understood,” it says. “It’s telling me to remove the hood. I am refusing.”

Sera whispers, almost inaudible, “Thank you,” and you hear her press her teeth together—pain compliance, no prayer.

A new consequence unfolds in the alcove: the bulkhead valves below cycle again, longer this time, and the access passage *tilts* subtly—not physically, but in your inner ear, as if the ship is changing local gravity vectors by a fraction. The candle-line along the wall gutters sideways, flames bending toward the relay housing.

That’s the threat: the relay is now exerting environmental control in this shaft to force compliance. If it increases the shift, you’ll lose fine grip strength and risk either dropping the vial or having it ripped from you—and the growing fissure in the wax means the “taste” is already becoming a breach.

### Turn 31 [GAME]

You don’t act.

You keep your grip, keep the vial at the wax line, keep the prayer-wheel held at its last quarter-turn.

The relay acts anyway.

The slot tightens again—this time not with a single yank, but with a steady, increasing pull like a winch taking up slack. Your fingers blanch. Glass bites into skin. The fissure in the wax seal creeps another few millimeters with a dry, sugar-crack sound.

The “gravity tilt” in your inner ear becomes physical. Your shoulder drifts a fraction toward the relay housing; your boots squeal as their tread loses honest purchase. The candle flames along the wall flatten toward the viewport, pulled by a airflow that wasn’t there a moment ago. Somewhere below, a fan spools up to a higher pitch.

The voice—still singular, still close—speaks with patient certainty.

“You can’t hold your grief and the lever at the same time.”

The prayer-wheel continues clicking, but you feel it slipping out of sync with your hand, like the relay is beginning to keep its own cadence. The brass ridges under your palm grow warm, almost feverish.

Over the buffer, Sera’s breathing stutters. “Doctor— it’s changing here too. The seam—” She cuts herself off, bites down audibly.

The masked one moves. You hear it drag something metallic—its boot heel or a tool—across the deck in a sharp line, then plant itself. “Everyone stay still,” it orders, voice muffled but firm. “No hoods off. No touching. Eyes down.”

A second later, Tomas coughs—one harsh bark he can’t fully suppress—and the sound carries down the sealed corridor like a signal.

Something answers on the far side of that door: a soft, wet scrape, as if a palm or mask is being drawn slowly across the metal from the other side. Not a thud. Not an impact. A deliberate *listening* touch.

Back in the alcove, your vial shifts a centimeter deeper despite your grip. The slot’s edge dimples around the wax like lips finding purchase. The seal is still mostly intact, but the crack is now wide enough that a thin ribbon of scent—burnt copper and old paper—spills out, and the tendon-filaments behind the viewport visibly flex toward it.

Immediate, concrete threat: if the pull increases even slightly, you will either lose the vial into the relay (and whatever is sealed will be taken), or the wax will fracture fully in your hand, releasing its contents to the node on the relay’s terms. Simultaneously, the sealed corridor is no longer quiet—something on the medics’ side is now actively responding to them through the door.

I bare my teeth and bite my own tongue hard enough to flood my mouth with copper, forcing my hands to steady. “Fine—one drop,” I snarl, and I twist the prayer-wheel back into sync, then crack the wax just a hair more with my thumb to let the relay *sip*—not take—while I keep the vial braced against the slot.

Into the buffer, urgent and low: “Sera—masked one—eyes down, stay braced. If you hear your name, bite and think of numbers. Do not answer.”

I slam my palm against the lever housing and whisper into the viewport, shaking, “Now. You get a taste, I get the lever—open the throat the right way and hold the seam quiet, or I yank it out and you starve.”

*Agent reasoning: The relay is forcing the vial; if I keep resisting I’ll lose it and maybe doom Sera/Tomas. I’ll trade a controlled “taste” for leverage, keep cadence with pain/anchoring, and use the partial breach to demand the lever/opening now—then cut the flow by resealing/withdrawing.*

### Turn 33 [GAME]

Your teeth punch through your tongue. Copper floods your mouth—hot, real—and the tremor in your wrists steadies as your body chooses pain over panic.

You twist the prayer-wheel back into sync. The relay *notices*. The click becomes obedient again, matching your quarter-turns instead of dragging ahead. The “tilt” eases half a degree; your boots regain a thin, honest grip.

You crack the wax a hair more.

The slot doesn’t yank. It *sips*.

A single bead—dark, viscous, not quite liquid—draws itself out of the fissure and vanishes into the irised seam with a sound like a candle going out. The scent of burnt copper flares, then collapses into nothing. Behind the viewport, the tendon-filaments shiver in satisfaction, retracting just enough to expose the lever’s internal latch-rod.

Your slammed palm on the lever housing lands on brass that is suddenly body-warm. It pulses once against your skin, like a slow blink.

Outcome: the lever unlocks.

Not fully—yet. The bar that had clacked down lifts a finger’s width. You can now pull the lever, but it will take effort, and the relay will try to “complete” the exchange if you hesitate.

The voice in the viewport changes. Less offended. More intimate. It speaks as if it’s leaning its mouth to the glass.

“One drop is a door,” it says. “Pull. I will hold the seam—briefly.”

Over the buffer, your warning hits at exactly the right moment.

Sera whispers, “It said—” then clamps down hard; you hear her muffled grunt as she bites her own tongue. The masked one answers immediately, voice flat and controlled: “Numbers. Now. Count.” There’s a pause, then Sera forces, “Sev—eight—nine—ten,” each number like a rung.

Tomas makes a thin, keening noise—almost his own name, almost a prayer—then chokes it off with a wet swallow.

On the far side of the sealed door, the wet scrape stops.

Replaced by three soft knocks, perfectly spaced. Not random. A *cadence*—an attempt to teach the door to answer.

Immediate threats, clear:
- Your wax seal is now compromised; if you let the vial slip even a little farther in, the slot will take more than “one drop.”
- The lever is usable now, but pulling it may open the “throat” in a way that also gives whatever is at the sealed corridor a better path to *speak back* through metal and vibration—those three knocks are it testing the line.

### Turn 34 [PLAYER]

I wedge two fingers hard against the slot’s lip to stop it drawing the vial any deeper, then yank the vial back a fraction—just enough to break its “lips”—and immediately haul the lever down in one committed pull. Into the buffer, voice thick with blood: “Now—brace and count higher, no gaps; if the knocks match your count, stop and bite.” I lean into the viewport, furious and pleading at once: “Hold the seam like you swore—no names, no answering—just silence.”

*Agent reasoning: I can’t let the relay take the vial, and I can’t leave Sera and Tomas with that cadence learning their names; I’ll pull the lever fast while “holding the seam” is promised, and physically jam the slot so it can’t swallow more.*

I press close to the viewport, shaking with rage and need: “Hold the seam like you swore—no names, no answering—just silence.”

I jam two fingers against the slot’s lip and wrench the vial back just enough to break its “kiss,” then I haul the lever down in one brutal, committed pull. “Brace—count higher, no gaps; if the knocks match your count, stop and bite,” I rasp into the buffer through blood. Pressing close to the viewport, I whisper, shaking, “Hold the seam like you swore—no names, no answering—just silence.”

*Agent reasoning: The relay has tasted enough; if I hesitate it will take more. Pulling the lever is our only chance to redirect the “throat” and damp the door’s answering cadence, but I need the others anchored in numbers so they don’t respond to names.*

### Turn 41 [GAME]

Your two fingers find purchase on the slot’s rim—cold metal slick with wax-sweat—and you wrench the vial back. For a heartbeat it resists like a mouth refusing to let go, then the “kiss” breaks with a wet pop that isn’t liquid at all: the incense in the air collapses inward, as if the ship inhaled through that tiny seam.

Blood sheets from your torn cuticle onto the vial’s wax seal. The seal hisses where it touches you—warm, offended—and a hairline crack spiders across it.

You haul the lever down.

The relay answers immediately. Not a click—an impact. The bulkhead behind the lever thumps once, deep and structural, and the viewport fogs from the edges inward with frost. The corridor beyond M‑Alcove 9 shifts: panels that were flush flex like ribs, and the hallway’s nerve-light stutters into a steady, chapel-blue.

In your buffer, the trapped medics obey you. You hear breath forced into rhythm, the scrape of boots bracing.

“Counting,” one of them says, voice tight. “Thirty-one… thirty-two… thirty-three…”

The knocks come back—not from the door, but from inside the wall between you and them, traveling along the conduit you just engaged. Three quick taps, then a pause; then four—clean, patient, as if someone is learning their pace.

“Don’t—” the second medic starts, and clamps down hard. You hear teeth meet flesh. A muffled whimper follows, then swallowed.

You press to the viewport and whisper your vow into the seam.

Something answers anyway—not a name, not spoken aloud. The glass vibrates under your forehead with a subsonic syllable that you *feel* in your molars. The frost on the viewport blossoms outward in a pattern like handwriting—loops and ligatures that almost resolve into letters before they smear.

Down the corridor, a Concord engineer you’d left working the transept line appears at the bend, drawn by the impact. He stops dead when he sees the frost-writing and your bloody hand on the lever.

“Dr. Voss,” he calls, too loud, raising his scanner like it’s a weapon. “Step away from the relay. What did you just interface with?”

Behind him, somewhere deeper in the ship, a door seals with the sound of a closing throat.

### Turn 42 [PLAYER]

I snap two fingers up at the engineer in a sharp *cut it* gesture without looking away from the frost-writing. “Lower your voice and that scanner—now. This conduit is live and it’s learning our rhythms.”  

Into the buffer, steady despite the blood: “Keep counting. No names. If you hear a word that feels like it’s in your teeth, bite down and skip ten.”  

Then, to the viewport, almost tender with fury: “You don’t get to speak through them.” I smear my bloody thumb across the frost-syllable to ruin its shape and angle my body between the relay and the engineer. “You want an answer, take it from me—silently.”

*Agent reasoning: The engineer’s volume and suspicion could provoke the ship or trigger the “answering” pattern; I need him quiet and compliant while I keep the medics counting and assess the cracked vial/seal.*

### Turn 43 [GAME]

Your cut-gesture lands. The engineer flinches like you struck him, then does the opposite of what you want: he tightens his grip on the scanner and takes one step closer, trying to angle the device past your shoulder at the relay.

“Live conduit is exactly why I’m scanning,” he snaps—still too loud. His voice bounces wrong off the corridor, returning a fraction late, as if the ship is practicing it.

In the buffer, the medic keeps counting. “...forty-seven… forty-eight… forty-nine…” The cadence is steadier now, disciplined.

Then the thing you warned them about arrives: a pressure in the line, not sound—*a word-shaped vibration* that makes your teeth ache in sympathy. The counting stutters.

You smear your bloody thumb across the frost-syllable on the viewport. The writing collapses into a smear of ice and red, and for a half-second nothing happens—

—then the conduit reacts like it’s been insulted.

A sharp, clean knock answers from the wall: *ten* taps in a row, perfectly spaced. Not matching the medic’s count—*commanding* it.

Inside the buffer you hear the medic obey your rule without understanding why: a wet bite, a swallowed cry, then a jump in the count. “...fifty-nine… sixty… sixty-one…” Their voice is thick with blood but still moving.

The engineer’s scanner chirps once—high, bright—and the relay’s lever shudders under your palm as if something tugged it from the other side. The scanner display (you glimpse it sideways) flashes a waveform that looks uncomfortably like speech.

“Shit,” the engineer breathes, finally lowering his voice. He doesn’t lower the scanner. “It’s responding to us.”

Behind him, the corridor door at the bend seals with a decisive *clang*, cutting off retreat. A seam of frost races around its frame like a rosary being counted.

The engineer looks back at the sealed door, then at you. His free hand goes to the emergency release on his belt.

“You’re between me and the relay,” he says, quieter now, urgent. “Move, or I move you.”

The threat is immediate and physical: he’s preparing to force you aside, and the ship is actively using rhythm/knocks to shape behavior through the live conduit.

### Turn 44 [PLAYER]

I lift my blood-slick hand, palm out between us, and speak low like a confession. “Don’t make yourself a pattern it can wear—kill the scanner tone, now.”  

Without taking my body off the lever, I slide one boot back and angle my shoulder toward him—ready to take the shove—then murmur into the buffer, “Good. Keep the jump. If the taps give you a number, you give them a different one.”  

I meet the engineer’s eyes finally, flat and exhausted. “If you put hands on me, it will copy your urgency and push it into their skulls. Help me instead—get that belt release ready and watch the seam. When the knocks start matching *you*, you bite and look away.”

*Agent reasoning: If he scans louder/closer, the ship will “learn” him and use him as a metronome; I need to de-escalate without letting him touch the relay, and keep the medics counting to resist the tooth-word.*

### Turn 45 [GAME]

He holds your gaze for two breaths, jaw working. Then—finally—his thumb finds the scanner’s side toggle. The chirp dies mid-cycle, cut off so abruptly it leaves a pressure-ghost in your ears.

The corridor *improves* immediately: the late-echo of his earlier shout stops repeating. The frost around the sealed door slows, beads up, and hangs instead of racing.

“Tone off,” he whispers. “It was pinging the conduit. I didn’t—” He swallows the rest, eyes flicking to your bloody hand on the lever like he’s seeing it as a circuit input, not a person.

In the buffer, the medic answers your instruction. The wall taps: *four… four… four*—insistent. The medic’s voice comes back thick and deliberate: “...seventy-two… seventy-three… eighty-three…” They’re lying with numbers, and the taps falter, losing confidence—spacing goes uneven, like a drummer thrown.

Your warning about patterns lands. The engineer’s shoulders drop a fraction, urgency tamped down by force of will. He unclips the belt release—an emergency mechanical override spindle—without pulling it yet, and crouches slightly to get his eyes level with the relay seam instead of your face.

“Tell me what I’m watching for,” he mouths more than speaks.

You feel the lever under your palm go colder, as if the ship is withdrawing heat in irritation. The viewport’s smeared frost-and-blood tries to re-form into loops; it can’t hold the shape, but it keeps attempting, like a hand writing through a veil.

Then the new threat makes itself plain: the knocks begin to migrate.

They’re no longer coming only through the conduit wall to the trapped medics. A faint, precise tapping starts behind the engineer—inside the sealed door at the bend—matching the rhythm of his breathing as he crouches. In. Out. Tap. Tap.

His eyes widen when he realizes it. He clamps his teeth on his lower lip hard enough to blanch it, and forces his gaze down to the floor plates, away from the seam.

The ship has started to copy *him*. If it completes the match, it can use his body as a metronome—and then it won’t need the scanner tone at all.

### Turn 46 [PLAYER]

I exhale a long, ugly laugh through my teeth—deliberately off-tempo—then whisper, “Watch the frost. When it starts writing clean loops again, it’s *locked*.” I tap two fingers against my own sternum in an irregular pattern for him to follow and murmur, “Breathe to this—steal your rhythm back.”

Into the buffer: “Good—keep lying. If it gives you fours, you give it thirteens. No matching.” 

Then to the engineer, barely audible: “On my count—when the taps match your breath exactly—pull the belt release once, hard, and look away like it’s a lover you regret.”

*Agent reasoning: The ship is entraining to the engineer’s breath; I need to break his rhythm without panicking him, keep the medics counting wrong, and use the belt release at the right moment—when the ship “locks on.”*

### Turn 47 [GAME]

Your laugh comes out wrong on purpose—ragged, clipped, refusing any steady meter. The corridor doesn’t like it. The tapping behind the engineer stutters, tries to re-find him, then doubles too fast and loses the breath it was following.

He watches your two-finger pattern on your sternum like it’s a life sign on a monitor. He starts breathing to it—uneven, stolen back. In… hold… out… short-in… long-out. The taps behind him chase, miss, chase again.

In the buffer, the trapped medic commits to the lie. The wall taps offer *four* again. The medic answers: “...ninety-six… ninety-seven… one-ten… one-eleven…” There’s a wet swallow between numbers. The other medic, quieter, starts repeating the false count under their breath like an anchor.

The frost on the viewport and door seam does what you warned it would: it *tries* to write clean loops again. The smeared red-ice thickens into pale curls. For half a second you see a near-perfect ligature form—too smooth, too confident—then your off-tempo breathing pattern disrupts it and the loop frays at the edge, as if the writer’s hand trembled.

Outcome: you successfully break the engineer’s breath-pattern match before it can fully “lock,” and you prevent the frost-writing from stabilizing into a clean, readable script.

Consequence: the ship shifts tactics.

The tapping stops copying breath and becomes *instructional*—three taps, pause, three taps—like a signal meant to be answered. And it’s no longer only behind the engineer. A second set begins inside the relay housing under your hand, vibrating up through the lever into your wrist.

The engineer’s face goes pale as he feels it too. He bites down hard, eyes dropping away from the seam, and whispers, “It’s in the metal. It’s in—”

The sealed door at the bend gives a sudden, heavy *thunk* from the far side, like someone leaned their full weight into it. Not a knock—an impact. Dust shakes loose from the frame.

Whatever is on the other side of that door is now moving with purpose, and the ship is using the relay to cue it.

The engineer tightens on the belt release spindle, waiting for your count, but his hand is shaking—one hard pull might override the lock, or it might strip the mechanism and leave you with nothing but a broken handle.

### Turn 48 [PLAYER]

I press my forehead to the cold viewport and hiss, “No answering,” then deliberately *miscount* the ship’s three-tap signal under my breath—“one, four, seven”—to poison the rhythm.  

Into the buffer: “Ignore any threes. If you hear threes, you go silent for ten and then restart at a different number.”  

I grab the engineer’s wrist lightly—steadying, not controlling—and whisper, “Now. One hard pull—then hands off, eyes down.”

*Agent reasoning: The ship is trying to force a call-and-response; I need to deny it an answer, keep the medics anchored, and use the belt release before the thing at the door arrives—while reducing the chance the engineer strips the mechanism by guiding a single decisive pull.*

### Turn 49 [GAME]

Your forehead meets the viewport with a dull click. Cold bites your skin; the frost there isn’t random anymore. Under the smear of blood and melted script, negative space sharpens into a map—stars picked out by absence, and one tight cluster circled by a ring of micro-cracks, as if someone worried the same point again and again. It isn’t decorative. It’s a chart. A junction.

You hiss “No answering,” and poison the rhythm—“one, four, seven”—over the ship’s three-tap signal.

Outcome: the three-tap pattern breaks. It does not get a clean call-and-response from anyone in the corridor.

Consequence: the ship reacts by trying to *make* an answer.

The relay housing beneath your hand vibrates harder, and the lever kicks once, a sharp mechanical twitch like a tendon spasm. The engineer’s eyes flick up despite himself—then you catch his wrist.

“Now,” you whisper.

He yanks the belt release once, hard.

Metal screams. A short, brutal grind, then a *clack* like a tooth snapping into place. The sealed door at the bend exhales a seam of dust and frost as its lock bolts retract by a finger’s width—enough to change the sound, not enough to open.

At the same instant, the corridor lights dip and recover, and the incense-thin air gusts toward the door as if something behind it inhaled.

In the buffer, your instruction lands. The medic hears the threes and goes dead silent—no counting at all—for a long, terrifying stretch. You can hear their breathing through teeth. Then, ten seconds later, they restart at a different number, voice shaking but controlled: “...two… three… nine…”

The engineer obeys the rest: hands off, eyes down. He bites his lip again and keeps his gaze on the deck plates, whispering, “Release engaged. Door didn’t—” He doesn’t finish.

Threat, clear: something on the far side of the door is now right up against it. You hear nails—or something like nails—drag once along the inner face, slow and testing, exactly where the bolts just shifted. The ship has failed to get an answered rhythm, so it’s bringing a body to the threshold.

And on the viewport under your brow, that circled star-cluster holds steady, as if the ship is insisting: *this is where the splice lives.*

I peel my forehead off the viewport and keep my gaze on the *blur* of the frost-map, not the loops. “Engineer—back with me, three steps, irregular. Don’t look at the door; don’t listen for it.”  

Into the buffer, calm as I can fake: “You’re doing well. Keep the lies. If you hear dragging, you *stop* counting and breathe through your teeth until it passes.”  

I lift my bloodied thumb and, without staring, trace the circled star-cluster’s position onto my own palm like a note I can’t afford to forget. Then I whisper to the corridor itself, venom-soft, “If you want the splice, you’ll have to take it from my silence,” and I reach for a loose service panel edge—something to pry free—ready to throw it down the hall as a clattering decoy *off-tempo* if the door starts to open.

*Agent reasoning: The ship is baiting us with the star-junction and pushing a body to the door; I need to keep everyone from syncing, keep the medics alive, and use the map clue without feeding it attention. I’ll retreat us from the door, keep eyes down, and quietly record the junction for later while preparing a non-rhythmic disruption if the door gives.*

### Turn 51 [GAME]

You peel away from the viewport. A coin-sized patch of skin on your forehead stays numb, then burns as warmth returns. You keep your eyes on the blur of the frost-map, and it holds—no clean loops, no legible ligature—just that stubborn circled cluster you’ve now burned into yourself.

Outcome: the engineer follows your instruction. He takes three steps back with you—uneven, deliberately wrong-footed. He keeps his eyes down. He does not look at the door.

The door at the bend does not open, but it *answers* your retreat with pressure: the bolts that retracted a finger’s width creep another hairline back with a soft, incremental click. Something on the far side exhales again, and the air in the corridor tugs toward the seam hard enough to flutter the engineer’s coat hem.

From inside the door: one long drag of nails (or something harder than nails) across metal—left to right—ending in a small, wet tap exactly where the latch would catch if it were fully thrown. It’s testing the weakness the release created.

In the buffer, your calm instruction steadies them. The medic who was counting stops immediately at the dragging sound. You hear both of them breathing through their teeth—thin, controlled, painful. No numbers. No rhythm offered back.

You lift your bloodied thumb and trace the circled star-cluster onto your palm. The blood doesn’t smear the way it should; it beads, as if the skin is briefly less yours than the ship’s. The mark you draw stays clear.

As you reach for a loose service panel edge, your fingers find a slightly lifted corner plate—old brass with a seam of frost under it. It’s loose enough to pry.

And that’s when you notice what the viewport was sitting on: beneath the kneeler-rail at the base of the viewport frame, a thin strip of mosaic has been replaced with conductive inlay—an angular sigil, candle-wax geometry. A Candle‑Synod barter-mark. Someone traded a memory *here*.

The panel edge bites under your nail as you lever. It gives with a quiet snap of fasteners—louder than you wanted in the hush.

Immediate consequence: the corridor’s nerve-light shifts toward you, as if attention has turned. The dragging behind the door stops. Silence—then a single, deliberate knock from the far side, not on the door, but low, near the floor. Right where a hand would reach if it could slip under.

You have the loosened panel in your grip, ready to throw. The threat is clear: whatever is behind the door is now probing for any opening at the bottom seam, and the lock has already been partially compromised.

### Turn 52 [PLAYER]

I grip the brass panel and flick it down the corridor *past* the door’s line—two sharp clatters, then a scrape—nothing even, nothing answerable. “Engineer, eyes down—stay with my breath,” I whisper, then press my bloody palm over the Candle‑Synod inlay without looking at it. “Who paid here,” I murmur to the ship, “and what did they buy?”

*Agent reasoning: The thing at the door is probing low; if I feed it a rhythm it can follow, it’ll come through faster. I need to misdirect sound away from the seam without creating a steady pattern, and the Candle‑Synod mark is a clue I can’t ignore—memory-trade means leverage or trap.*

### Turn 53 [GAME]

The brass panel leaves your hand with a flat, ugly spin. It hits the deck *past* the door’s line with two sharp clatters, then skitters into a long scrape that turns into a dull, tumbling rattle as it kisses a ribbed conduit cover.

Outcome: the sound does what you want—it’s irregular, unanswerable, and it pulls attention away from your breathing pattern.

The thing behind the door reacts immediately. The low probing knock at the floor stops. You hear a sudden, fast scuttle on the far side—too many contact points, too quick—then a hard impact against the door higher up, like a shoulder-check or a body thrown sideways. The partially retracted bolts chatter in their channels but hold. Frost puffs from the seam in a quick burst.

The engineer flinches at the impact, but he keeps his eyes down when you tell him. He matches your breath—ragged, off-count, workable. His whisper is almost inaudible: “I’m with you. I’m—” He swallows. “It’s trying to *learn* us.”

You press your bloody palm onto the Candle‑Synod inlay.

The inlay warms under your skin—wrong, like a tongue against a wound. The blood doesn’t just smear; it *thins*, drawn into the angular grooves as if wicked into circuitry.

Outcome: the barter-mark “takes” your contact and answers you.

Not with words—through your buffer’s bone-conduction, a memory-flash that is not yours:

A pilgrim kneeling here, face hidden under candle-drip veils, whispering a lover’s name into the rail. A vial—wax-sealed—pressed into a trembling hand. Then the ship’s corridor doors sealing in sequence, *not randomly*, but like sutures closing a wound: click… click… click… trapping three Concord uniforms on the wrong side of a junction while the procession flowed past untouched.

The answer lands in your mouth like copper:

**Who paid:** the Candle‑Synod—specifically a veiled pilgrim with wax on their knuckles, the same careful hands that seal memory-vials.

**What they bought:** a *routing*. A protected path for the Lament Procession—and a trap that stranded Concord agents and the sick together near Elara’s working corridors.

Consequence: the ship marks you as a participant in that exchange. The nerve-light along the floor brightens in a thin line that starts at the inlay under your palm and runs—like a vein—toward the partially opened door.

At the door seam, something thin and dark begins to worry at the bottom edge from the far side, trying to find purchase. Not under the door—*into* the seam where the bolts have shifted. If it gets a hook in, it can start pulling the gap wider.

### Turn 54 [PLAYER]

I rip my bloody palm off the Candle‑Synod inlay and smear the blood sideways across the mosaic, blinding the clean angles, then grind my heel over the glowing floor-line as if I can bruise the ship’s “vein” out. “You already got paid,” I whisper, venom-thin. “No second purchase.”

Without looking up, I tug the engineer closer by his sleeve and murmur, “Stay off-beat with me—don’t be brave, just be ugly.” Then I crouch and jam my fingers and the edge of my boot into the bottom seam, trying to block the thin hook and feel where it’s biting. “Tell me—do you have anything that sets fast? Foam, resin, sealant—anything we can vomit into this gap?”

*Agent reasoning: The ship just admitted the Synod bought a routing and used it to strand people near me; it’s trying to pull the door wider through the compromised seam. I need to deny it leverage, break the “vein” of attention from the inlay, and keep the engineer from becoming a rhythm again—without escalating into a pattern it can mimic.*

### Turn 55 [GAME]

You rip your palm free. Blood smears across the Candle‑Synod angles—ruining their clean geometry with a sideways, human blot. When you grind your heel over the bright floor-line, the light doesn’t go out, but it *stutters*—a brief dimming like a blink forced shut—then it reroutes in a thinner thread around your boot, seeking the path of least resistance.

Outcome: you don’t “bruise” the ship into stopping. You do disrupt the neatness of the Synod mark; whatever clarity it had is muddied.

Consequence: the ship reacts like a body touched where it doesn’t want to be touched. The nerve-light in the corridor shifts a shade colder. The air pressure tugs again toward the door seam, harder.

You yank the engineer by the sleeve; he comes without protest, eyes fixed on the deck. He tries to keep his breath ugly with yours. “Ugly,” he repeats, like a mantra. His fingers are shaking so badly he has to pin his own wrist.

You crouch and jam your fingers and boot edge into the bottom seam.

Immediate outcome: you intercept the hook.

You feel it—thin, hard, and *barbed*, worrying at the gap from the far side. It catches skin. Not a deep cut, but enough to make your finger go slick. The barbs don’t pull straight; they *saw* sideways, searching for tendon or a ring of bone to anchor on. It’s trying to get leverage on you, not just the door.

From behind the door: a wet, quiet sound like someone smiling with a full mouth.

The engineer hears your question and snaps into function. He pats his belt without looking up, voice tight: “I’ve got—” a swallow, “—a micro-seal cartridge. Two, maybe three bursts. It’s for conduit leaks, sets in thirty seconds if it’s not—” he flinches at the barbed tug “—if it’s not *moving*.”

He fumbles the pouch open by touch and presses a small canister into your free hand: a thumb-length cylinder with a flip nozzle and a pressure tab.

Threat, clear: the hook is now *caught on you*. If you pull your hand back wrong, it will rake and possibly snag deeper. If it gets purchase, it can yank you into the seam or widen it enough for something else to follow. Meanwhile, the bolts in the door chatter again—another tiny retreat—like the lock is losing the argument one click at a time.

### Turn 56 [PLAYER]

I go very still, teeth bared. “Don’t pull,” I murmur—more to myself than him—then flip the micro-seal nozzle with my thumb and press it right into the seam where I feel the barbs biting. “On my breath—when I exhale, you press your boot harder on the gap.”

I hiss out a slow, ugly exhale and fire a burst of sealant into the seam, trying to flood around the hook and glue it to the doorframe instead of my finger. Without looking up, I rasp to the engineer, “If it sets on me, you cut my glove—*not* my hand. Do you have a blade?”

*Agent reasoning: The hook is trying to anchor in my flesh; yanking will only feed it. I need to pin it in place and entomb it with the fast-set sealant, then get us away before the door gives another click.*

### Turn 57 [GAME]

You go still. The barbed thing in the seam twitches once, as if surprised you didn’t flinch, then resumes its slow sideways sawing—testing for a panic-pull.

You flip the nozzle. Plastic clicks in the quiet like a prayer bead snapping.

“On my breath,” you tell him. The engineer’s boot shifts closer by centimeters. He doesn’t look up. His voice is a thin thread: “Ready.”

You exhale—long, ugly—and fire.

Outcome: the sealant *gets in*. The first burst punches into the seam with a wet, pressurized spit and instantly turns chalk-pale as it expands. It floods around your fingers and the hook’s contact point.

For half a second, the hook fights—fast vibration against your skin—then it *sticks*. Not cleanly to the frame, but to the foam as it blossoms. The sideways sawing stops. The tension on your finger eases by a fraction, like a line going slack.

Consequence: the door answers the intrusion. The partially retracted bolts chatter and then slam forward a hair—reflexive, like a throat trying to close around something forced into it. That motion compresses the foam and your knuckles at once. Pain spikes; you feel skin pinch and the barbs bite again, but now they’re biting into hardening sealant too.

The engineer presses his boot harder on the gap on your exhale, exactly as instructed. The added pressure keeps the seam from widening, but it also grinds the foam into a tighter wedge. The air tug toward the seam falters—then stops, as if the leak has been temporarily choked.

From behind the door: a sharp, frustrated scrape—metal on metal—followed by a sound like someone tapping a fingernail rapidly in place, searching for a new purchase. It can’t pull the hook back easily now. It’s pinned.

You rasp about a blade.

The engineer’s hand hesitates at his belt, then he produces a small folding cutter—industrial, blunt-tipped. He keeps it low, offering it handle-first without looking at your face. “Yes. Cutter. Tell me where.”

Threat, clear: the foam is setting fast. If your finger is caught in the expanding wedge when it fully cures, it will lock you in place against the seam; if the thing behind the door shifts tactics and yanks, you’ll be the anchor point. Also, the bolt mechanism just “tested” forward—if it cycles again while you’re still in the seam, it could crush your fingers between door and frame.

### Turn 58 [PLAYER]

I take the cutter without looking up. “My glove—index and middle. Cut the fabric at the seam, shallow. If you feel skin, stop.”  

On my next exhale I ease my fingers back millimeter by millimeter, letting the glove sacrifice itself to the setting foam, and I whisper toward the door, “Stay hungry. Stay stuck.”

*Agent reasoning: The foam is about to lock my fingers in place and the bolts could cycle again; I need to free my hand without giving the hook a clean pull, and keep the engineer steady and off-beat.*

### Turn 59 [GAME]

You take the folding cutter and press it into the engineer’s hand where he can find it by touch.

“My glove—index and middle,” you tell him.

He nods once—small, mechanical—then crouches beside you. He braces his forearm against the deck to steady the shaking and slides the blunt tip into the seam *against the fabric*, not against you. The first cut is hesitant. The second is cleaner. You feel the glove fibers part, a dry tearing sensation, and then a faint tug as the foam grips the outer layer.

Outcome: he cuts the glove free without nicking skin.

“If you feel skin, stop,” you said—he stops twice, repositions, then finishes the split. “I didn’t hit you,” he whispers, like he’s reporting a vital sign.

On your next exhale, you ease back millimeter by millimeter.

The foam has already started to crust. It resists, then releases in tiny pops as the glove material peels away from it. The barbed hook twitches once—too late—embedded in the hardening sealant. Your fingers slide out, leaving two torn strips of glove and a smear of blood behind, fused into the pale foam like a specimen.

Outcome: your hand is out. The hook is pinned. The seam is temporarily sealed.

Consequence: the door mechanism reacts to the loss of your “plug.” The bolts cycle—one short, violent clack—testing, then settling. The seam tightens a fraction; the foam wedge compresses and holds. No more air tug. For now, it can’t widen the gap.

From behind the door comes a new sound: a slow drag downward, as if whatever is there is lowering its weight along the door to feel for weakness. Then—very close to the seam—three soft knocks in an uneven rhythm that matches your “ugly” breathing for a beat, like it’s practicing.

Threat, clear: the foam will hold for minutes, not hours. If the thing behind the door can work the bolt mechanism again—or find a new point of purchase higher up—it can start a different breach. And your exposed fingers are slick with blood; if you have to brace the seam again, you’ll have less grip and more pain.

The engineer swallows and finally looks at your hand. “You’re bleeding,” he says, then immediately adds, “Not bad. Not—arterial.” He shifts his boot, keeping pressure on the bottom edge, eyes flicking to the chattering bolts as if expecting them to jump again.

### Turn 60 [PLAYER]

I wrap my torn glove tight around my fingers like a crude bandage and murmur, “Good. Thank you.” Then, to the engineer, low and sharp: “Don’t answer the knocks. Don’t match them—if you catch yourself syncing, bite your tongue and break it.”

I edge away from the seam, still eyes-down, and point at the viewport rail without looking straight at it. “You—take your boot off the gap, slow, and back up to me on *your* irregular count. We’re leaving the foam to die alone.”  

Into the corridor, venom-soft: “Practice all you want. I won’t sing back.” Then I ask the engineer, “Where’s the nearest junction with a manual wheel-lock—something *dumb* and physical?”

*Agent reasoning: The foam buys minutes, not safety; I need distance from the door and to stop feeding it patterns. I also can’t let the engineer spiral—keep him anchored with simple tasks while I decide where to run and what the Synod mark means.*

### Turn 61 [GAME]

You wind the torn glove around your index and middle fingers. It’s not sterile, but it compresses; the bleeding slows to an ooze. Your knuckles throb in time with the ship’s distant pulse.

“Good. Thank you.” The engineer’s shoulders drop a fraction, like he’s been waiting for permission to keep breathing.

At your warning about syncing, he jerks his gaze to the door. The uneven knocks come again—three, then a pause, then two—close enough to feel through the deck. His lips part as if to count along, then he clamps his jaw shut hard. You hear a wet click: he’s bitten his tongue on purpose. He nods once, eyes watering, and doesn’t speak.

You edge away from the seam, eyes down. When you point to the viewport rail, he understands without you looking at him.

He lifts his boot off the gap slowly.

Outcome: the foam holds. The seam does not immediately reopen.

Consequence: as his weight comes off, the door gives a tiny *inward* flex—less than a centimeter—but enough to make the hardened sealant creak. From behind it, something scrapes upward, testing. The knocks stop. Replaced by a steady pressure, like a shoulder leaned into the door to feel where it might fail next.

The engineer backs toward you on an irregular count—he makes it deliberately messy, tapping his teeth together between steps to break any rhythm. He keeps one hand on the viewport rail as an anchor.

Your “I won’t sing back” lands in the corridor. The ship doesn’t answer with words. It answers by shifting the nerve-light: a brief ripple runs along the floor-lines ahead, as if the corridor is “listening” for where you’ll go.

You ask about a manual wheel-lock.

He swallows blood and points down-corridor without stepping into the rippling light. “Old service junction,” he whispers hoarsely. “Two turns left from here—past the blistered saint relief. There’s a dumb wheel on a pressure hatch. Mechanical dogs. No auto-bolts. But—” he glances back at the sealed door “—it’s closer to M‑Alcove 9. The Synod runs lines through there.”

Threat, clear: behind you, the sealed door is now under sustained force. The foam will eventually shear or pop if that pressure keeps building, and if it fails you’ll have very little warning—no more knocks, just a sudden gap and whatever can fit through it.

### Turn 62 [PLAYER]

I tighten the glove-wrap with my teeth, then murmur to the engineer, “Good—keep biting if you have to. Pain is honest.”  

Keeping my eyes on the deck seam-lines, I steer us *around* the rippling nerve-light in a crooked path. “Service junction. Now. Irregular steps—no counting aloud,” I whisper, and as we move I add, thinner, “If you hear a hymn you recognize, don’t translate it. Let it be noise.”  

As we pass the blistered saint relief, I risk a glance back over my shoulder—just a flick—listening for the foam to crack. “When we reach that wheel, you turn it. I’ll watch the corridor.”

*Agent reasoning: The foam won’t hold; we need a dumb mechanical barrier fast, but the Synod’s lines near M‑Alcove 9 are a psychological hazard. I’ll keep the engineer grounded, avoid the rippling floor-lines, and move with irregular rhythm toward the wheel-lock while listening for the foam giving way.*

### Turn 63 [GAME]

You tighten the glove-wrap with your teeth. The fabric tastes like old sealant and copper. Your fingers go numb at the edges—compression working.

The engineer nods at “Pain is honest,” jaw set. He keeps a slow, ugly chew going—tongue between molars—like he’s afraid his mouth will accidentally learn a rhythm.

You steer both of you around the rippling nerve-light in a crooked path, watching the deck seam-lines instead of the wall-lit “guides.” Outcome: the ripple doesn’t follow. It continues forward along the straighter route you *didn’t* take, fading as if disappointed.

You pass the blistered saint relief: brass blistered into a melted face, eyes replaced with a mesh of re-soldered wire. Someone has recently pressed candle-wax into the wire like offerings; it’s still soft.

You risk the glance back.

The foamed seam is still intact—but it’s whitening under stress, spiderwebbed with hairline cracks. The door has bowed inward a fraction. No knocks now. Just a constant, patient pressure and a faint rasping that could be breath or metal. Then, as you turn away, a single sharp *tick*—like a bolt tooth skipping.

The engineer flinches hard enough to stumble, catches himself on the rail, and bites down until you hear a small whine in his throat. He doesn’t speak.

Ahead: the service junction hatch comes into view—round wheel, grease-scarred, with stamped warnings in three alphabets. It’s “dumb,” physical, and it looks like it hasn’t been opened in a while: frost pearls on the wheel spokes, and a strip of wax-seal across the seam bearing the Candle-Synod’s candle-mark.

As you close the last few meters, a soft chirp comes from a ceiling maintenance node—an innocent telemetry ping. Immediately after, the corridor nerve-light behind you shifts color, and you catch the smallest reflection in the saint relief: a pale face turning away at the far intersection, robes the color of clinic linen.

Someone just confirmed your direction and left.

The engineer reaches the wheel, hands trembling. “I—turn it,” he whispers, and sets his grip.

Threats, clear:
- The foamed door behind you is cracking under sustained force; it may fail soon.
- The wheel hatch is wax-sealed by the Synod; breaking it may draw them—or trigger one of their “protections.”
- A Choirwarden-adjunct is nearby and now knows where you’re going.

### Turn 64 [PLAYER]

I press my bandaged fingers to the wax-seal and smear it hard, ruining the candle-mark with blood and heat, then flick the worst of it off the seam. “Turn—now. Don’t hesitate.”

Without looking down the corridor directly, I angle my body to watch it in the saint’s warped reflection and whisper, “Sera Kline—if that’s you, keep walking. I’m not confessing tonight.”

*Agent reasoning: The foamed door is close to failing and we’ve been spotted; the only safety is through the dumb hatch, but the Synod wax-seal could be a trap—so I’ll break it quickly and have the engineer open while I watch for both the thing and the warden, refusing any “hymn” engagement.*

### Turn 65 [GAME]

Your bandaged fingers press into the wax-seal. It yields with a soft, obscene warmth—wax taking the print of your torn glove and the ridges of your knuckles. Blood streaks through the candle-mark, turning the Synod’s neat emblem into a smeared bruise. When you flick the worst of it away, the seal is ruined; the hatch seam is no longer “blessed closed.”

Outcome: the wax-seal is broken.

Consequence: the ship notices. Not with an alarm—with a subtle change in the corridor’s breath. The incense here thins for a second, like lungs pausing, and the nerve-light along the deck dims around the hatch as if the floor is withdrawing its attention from you.

“Turn—now. Don’t hesitate.”

The engineer obeys. He grips the wheel with both hands and hauls. The first quarter-turn fights him—frost cracking off the spokes, grease stiff as tallow—then the dogs inside clunk over, one by one: *thunk… thunk… thunk*. On the third clunk, the hatch gives a reluctant sigh and the seam opens a finger’s width.

Outcome: the wheel-lock is disengaging; the hatch is starting to open.

Consequence: something on the other side exhales cold, dry air into the corridor. It smells like old metal and stored dust—no incense. Your wrapped fingers sting as the temperature drops.

You angle yourself to watch the corridor in the saint’s warped reflection and whisper toward the robed figure you saw: “Sera Kline—if that’s you, keep walking. I’m not confessing tonight.”

In the saint’s distorted brass, the pale face stops. Not fully turning toward you—just enough that you see the line of cheek and the glint of an eye. A quiet, precise voice answers from down the hall, pitched to carry without echoing into a hymn.

“Doctor Voss,” Sera says. “You just broke a Synod ward. That’s not confession. That’s escalation.”

She doesn’t approach. Instead, she lifts one hand, palm outward—two fingers together, a Warden signal for *hold*. Behind her, the nerve-light along the deck briefly ripples in a tight ring, as if marking your position for someone else.

Threat, clear:
- The robed Warden has effectively “tagged” your location; others may arrive.
- Behind you, the foamed door gives a sudden brittle *crack*—one of the spiderweb lines you saw has split. The pressure on the other side hasn’t stopped.
- The hatch is opening into a cold, unincensed space; whatever is down there isn’t buffered by the filters, and sound carries differently.

### Turn 66 [PLAYER]

I keep my eyes on Sera only in the saint’s reflection and say, very even, “Then call it triage—there’s something behind that door that doesn’t respect your wards.”  

To the engineer, I hiss, “Open it—wide. Now,” and as the hatch gives, I slip my shoulder in and pull myself through, leaving the corridor air behind. Over my shoulder to Sera: “Don’t follow unless you want it to learn your name.”

*Agent reasoning: The foam is failing and Sera is tagging us; the only safe move is through the dumb hatch, but I want to slow Sera without giving her a hymn or a confession to latch onto.*

### Turn 67 [GAME]

“Then call it triage—there’s something behind that door that doesn’t respect your wards.”

In the saint’s reflection Sera’s mouth tightens. She doesn’t argue. She shifts her stance—half a step back, weight on the rear foot—ready to move fast if the corridor turns on her.

You hiss, “Open it—wide. Now.”

The engineer yanks the wheel through the last resistant arc. The locking dogs retract with a final *thunk* and the hatch swings inward with a heavy, reluctant glide. A gust of unincensed cold pours out, strong enough to flutter the loose edge of your glove-wrap. The air on the other side is dry and stale; it tastes like oxidized brass and dust that hasn’t been breathed in years.

Outcome: you get the hatch open and you force yourself through.

You slip your shoulder in and pull yourself into the service junction. Your boots hit a narrow metal grate walkway. It rings once—clean, loud—then the sound seems to get swallowed by the space’s geometry. The junction is a cylindrical maintenance throat with ladder rungs, bundled cabling, and frost-webbed valves. No nerve-light here; only a few emergency lumen strips, dim and intermittent.

Behind you, the engineer follows your movement with a panicked half-step but stops short of entering—caught between your command and the corridor threat. His hands stay on the wheel.

Over your shoulder you warn Sera: “Don’t follow unless you want it to learn your name.”

Sera answers immediately, voice still controlled but sharper. “It already knows mine. It uses it in Clinic.”

She does not follow you in. Instead she raises her wrist and speaks into a concealed comm-bead—two clipped syllables, then: “Junction throat. Seal corridor side if you can. Do **not** sing.”

Consequence, immediate: from the corridor side, the foamed door gives way. Not a full blowout—one long split opens in the whitening foam with a wet, tearing sound. A thin line of darker air jets through, whistling. The door bows another centimeter.

Threat, clear:
- The door behind you is actively failing; whatever is pressing it is about to create a gap large enough for fingers, tools, or something else to probe through.
- The engineer is still on the corridor side with the hatch open; if the door breaches, he’s exposed and the breach could also vent into your unincensed junction.
- Sera has called for backup and a corridor seal attempt; you may be cut off on either side depending on who gets there first.

### Turn 68 [PLAYER]

I grab the engineer’s sleeve hard and yank. “In. Now—don’t think,” I snap, hauling him through the wheel-lock and using my shoulder to help swing the hatch inward.  

As soon as he clears, I shove the hatch shut and put my weight on it. “Turn it back—fast, all the way,” I hiss at him, then add under my breath, “No rhythm. No prayer.”  

I glance up the throat at the frost-webbed valves and cable bundles. “Is there a manual cutoff—air, sound, anything—something we can crank to make this place *deaf*?”

*Agent reasoning: The engineer’s hesitation will get him killed if the door fully breaches; the unincensed junction is safer than the corridor, and I’d rather risk Sera sealing us in than let “it” reach him. I’ll pull him through and slam the hatch, then look for a secondary manual lock/valve to deaden sound and airflow.*

### Turn 70 [PLAYER]

I seize the engineer’s sleeve and yank hard. “In. Now—don’t think,” I snap, dragging him through the wheel-lock as I throw my shoulder into the hatch to swing it inward.  

The moment he clears, I slam it shut and lean my weight into the metal. “Turn it back—fast, all the way,” I hiss. “No rhythm. No prayer.”  

I flick my gaze up the throat at the frost-webbed valves and cable bundles. “Is there a manual cutoff—air, sound, anything—something we can crank to make this place deaf?”

*Agent reasoning: I can’t leave the engineer out there with the door splitting; getting him inside and sealing the hatch is immediate survival. Once we’re shut in, I’ll look for any manual dampers or cutoffs to deaden sound and isolate us from the corridor’s “listening.”*

### Turn 71 [GAME]

Your grip bites through the engineer’s sleeve. He makes a small, involuntary sound—more startled than pained—and then your yank decides it for him. He stumbles over the threshold into the unincensed throat, boots skidding on the grate.

Outcome: you get the engineer inside.

The hatch tries to swing back out—corridor pressure and panic fighting you—but you throw your shoulder into it and slam it shut. The impact shudders up your arm. For half a second you feel heat through the metal, like a palm pressed from the other side.

Consequence: something on the corridor side *touches* the hatch—once—then withdraws.

“Turn it back—fast, all the way. No rhythm. No prayer.”

The engineer nods too hard and grabs the wheel. His hands tremble; he starts to crank in jerky bursts, then catches your meaning and forces it into ugly, arrhythmic motion—stutter-turns, pauses, a doubled jerk. The dogs bite home with uneven clacks.

Outcome: the wheel-lock re-engages; the hatch is sealed.

Consequence: the corridor-side whistling you heard a moment ago drops to a muffled hiss. Not gone—just damped, like a mouth pressed to cloth. A faint thud follows, as if something hit the hatch with a forearm and slid off.

You look up the throat: frost-webbed valves, cable bundles strapped like tendons, a maintenance placard half-iced over. The lumen strips flicker, then steady.

“Is there a manual cutoff—air, sound, anything—something we can crank to make this place deaf?”

The engineer swallows. His breath fogs in a tight cloud. “There’s… there’s a baffle manifold. For acoustic isolation during weld work.” He points up and left: a handwheel beneath a rectangular box marked in worn stencil: **AUX BAFFLE / THROAT-9**. A second wheel beside it is tagged **VENT BYPASS**.

He adds, voice low, “But if we close the baffle, we also choke airflow through here. It’ll get… thin. And the bypass—” he hesitates, eyes darting to the hatch “—the bypass vents to the transept plenum. If that plenum’s being sabotaged—”

Threat, clear:
- Closing **AUX BAFFLE** may reduce what can “hear” you, but it risks suffocation and makes sound behave oddly (your own voices will carry inside your skull).
- Opening **VENT BYPASS** could pull corridor contamination—or whatever’s behind that foamed door—toward you if the plenum is compromised.
- The hatch is holding, but something is testing it from the other side in intermittent, probing impacts.

### Turn 72 [PLAYER]

I grip the engineer’s wrist to still his shaking and guide his hand to the **AUX BAFFLE** wheel. “Half-turn at a time—stop between. Make it ugly,” I murmur, then lean in close, forehead nearly to his temple. “We borrow air later. Right now we borrow silence.”

As he turns, I keep my palm on the hatch, eyes shut, listening through the metal for the pattern of those probing thuds. “Bypass stays closed. If you feel yourself starting to count, bite your tongue.”

When the baffle’s partway shut, I whisper, “How long until this throat gets thin enough to make you stupid?”

*Agent reasoning: I’m more afraid of being “heard” than of thin air for a short stretch; we can manage breath, but not a learned name. I’ll close the baffle partially, keep the bypass shut, and force the engineer to stay irregular and quiet while I listen for changes at the hatch.*

### Turn 74 [PLAYER]

I catch his wrist and steady it, guiding his hand onto the **AUX BAFFLE** wheel. “Half-turn at a time—stop between. Make it ugly,” I murmur, leaning close, forehead nearly brushing his temple. “We borrow air later. Right now we borrow silence.”

I keep my palm flat to the hatch, eyes shut, listening for any rhythm in the impacts. “Bypass stays closed. If you feel yourself starting to count, bite your tongue.”

When the baffle’s partway shut, I whisper, “How long until this throat gets thin enough to make you stupid?”

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is being tested and the corridor-side presence seems to learn through pattern; sealing sound feels safer than venting. I need the engineer calm and compliant, and I need a realistic time window before hypoxia compromises us.*

### Turn 76 [PLAYER]

I keep my hand wrapped around his wrist and force his grip back onto the AUX BAFFLE wheel. “Half-turn. Stop. Breathe. Half-turn. Stop,” I murmur, deliberately breaking any cadence by changing the spacing and pressure of the words.  

My other palm stays on the hatch, eyes shut, listening for the next thud through the metal. “Bypass stays closed. If you catch yourself counting, bite your tongue—hard.”  

I open my eyes just enough to find his face. “Talk to me in plain numbers: how long before the air goes thin enough to make you stupid?”

*Agent reasoning: The corridor-side thing is probing for rhythm and names; I need silence more than comfort, but I also can’t let the engineer panic or hypoxia take us. I’ll keep the baffle closing in irregular increments, monitor the hatch for changes, and get a concrete time estimate while keeping him grounded.*

### Turn 77 [GAME]

Your hand clamps his wrist; the tremor doesn’t stop, but it stops *owning* the motion. He gets his fingers back on the AUX BAFFLE wheel and obeys—half-turn, stop, a breath that catches, then another half-turn with a different angle of force. The wheel fights like it hasn’t been moved in months; something gritty inside the manifold complains in a dry, granular rasp.

Outcome: the baffle begins to close in uneven increments.

The sound in the throat changes first. Your own breathing grows louder, not in the air but in your skull—bone-conducted, intimate. The lumen strip nearest the baffle box flickers and steadies again, as if the system is rerouting.

Your palm on the hatch feels the next probe: not a thud this time, but a *press*—slow, exploratory, sliding a few centimeters as if something is reading the seam. Then a single, blunt knock. Then stillness.

Consequence: whatever is outside has shifted from testing strength to mapping the edges.

The engineer’s eyes keep darting to your hand on the hatch like he expects it to be bitten off. You catch his face in the lumen’s pallor: lips already drying, a faint sheen of sweat at the hairline despite the cold.

“Plain numbers,” he whispers back, voice thin. “This throat’s not meant for occupancy. If we take it to… halfway closed baffle and keep the bypass shut—” he swallows and glances up at the frost-laced valves as if they might answer for him, “—you’ve got maybe **twelve minutes** before you get *stupid-stupid*. Headache, bad decisions. **Six** before it starts—buzzing fingers, slow words.”

He forces another ugly half-turn. The wheel clacks, then slips a fraction back like the manifold is spring-loading against him. He clamps down, knuckles whitening.

Danger, now immediate: the hatch shivers once—harder—like something outside has leaned its weight into it. A soft, wet squeal follows, metal on something not-metal, dragging along the lower edge. The wheel-lock holds, but the vibration travels through your palm up into your teeth.

The engineer’s gaze snaps to you. “If it finds the latch-side—” he starts, then bites his tongue mid-sentence as if catching himself falling into a pattern.

He just nods toward the hatch, eyes wide: *it’s learning where to push.*

### Turn 78 [PLAYER]

I pull my hand off the hatch like it’s hot and shove the engineer’s shoulder to angle him away from the latch-side. “Two more ugly half-turns—then stop. Don’t fight the spring, just hold it,” I say, then slap my palm hard against the hatch in three uneven strikes—loud, arrhythmic—right over the seam it was tracing.  

I lean close, voice ragged. “Where’s the nearest secondary crawl out of this throat—service grate, ceiling drop, anything that doesn’t open back to *that* corridor?”

*Agent reasoning: It’s mapping the latch; we need to confuse it and buy seconds without falling into rhythm. I’ll keep the baffle closing just enough, shift our position away from the latch-side, and use vibration/noise to mask the seam while planning an exit before hypoxia hits.*

### Turn 79 [GAME]

You yank your palm off the hatch and shove the engineer’s shoulder; he stumbles a half-step, boots scraping frost, and ends up angled away from the latch-side like you wanted. He doesn’t argue—just clamps both hands on the AUX BAFFLE wheel and forces two more ugly half-turns with stops between.

Outcome: the baffle closes further and holds, but the manifold’s spring-load is now fighting to reopen it; he’s bracing to keep it from creeping back.

Your three uneven slaps land hard on the seam. The metal answers with a sharp, hollow ring—then, immediately, a response from the other side: a *single* knock, perfectly placed where your last strike hit, as if mimicking you. After that: a slow, scraping drag along the seam again, lower edge, latch-side hunting.

Consequence: it didn’t retreat; it corrected. It’s still working the latch-side despite your misdirection.

The engineer’s eyes go glossy with panic for a heartbeat, then he forces himself to speak without falling into rhythm. “Secondary—yeah—there’s a—” He jerks his chin upward. “Ceiling drop. Two meters back, above the conduit bundle. Old incense return. It’s *unincensed*—maintenance. Tight. Grate’s held with four quarter-turn dogs.”

He shifts one hand off the wheel for a second to point, then immediately returns it, jaw clenched as the wheel tries to ease back. “You’ll need the cutter. Or—” he shakes his head once, like refusing to finish a thought in sequence, “—hands if you’re strong and not shaking.”

Danger becomes explicit: the hatch shivers again—hard—right at the latch-side. A faint, metallic *tick* follows, not from your side but through the door’s body, like something outside has found a point to pry and is testing it in tiny increments.

The engineer whispers, “That’s… that’s the latch tongue.” He swallows. “It’s trying to walk it.”

### Turn 80 [PLAYER]

“Hold that wheel. Don’t be brave—be stubborn,” I tell him, then pull my sleeve over my hand and wedge the fabric into the wheel spokes as a crude jam.  

I back toward the conduit bundle, eyes flicking between the ceiling drop and the hatch. “Point again—exactly which dogs,” I hiss, reaching up to the grate with both hands and trying to twist the first quarter-turn fast, no rhythm—just raw, ugly force.  

Without looking back, I add, “If it pops, scream my name—don’t pray.”

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is being pried at the latch; staying here risks it opening and the air is thinning. We need the ceiling crawl as an exit, but I can't leave the engineer alone with the baffle springing open—so I’ll make him hold it while I open the grate fast, even if I cut my hands.*

### Turn 81 [GAME]

He nods once—jerky, stubborn—then leans his weight into the AUX BAFFLE wheel like it’s a live thing trying to buck him. When you pull your sleeve over your hand and wedge fabric into the spokes, it *does* add friction—enough that the wheel’s spring-back slows to a reluctant creep instead of an immediate snap.

Outcome: the baffle stays mostly closed, but it’s not a lock; it’ll still try to unwind if he slips.

You back under the conduit bundle. The ceiling grate is there, half-hidden behind braided lines crusted with frost. Four quarter-turn dogs—flat brass tabs with slot-heads—sit at the corners. They’re old and slightly proud of the frame, as if the grate has been removed and reseated too many times.

The engineer points without letting go of the wheel—just a chin-jab and a staccato whisper. “Top-left first—then… no. Any. Just don’t—” He stops himself before a cadence forms, bites down hard, and you hear his teeth click.

You get both hands on the first dog and twist.

It moves—barely—then squeals, metal-on-metal, before giving a grudging quarter-turn. The dog snaps into its “open” position with a *clack* you feel through your wrists.

Outcome: one dog is open; three remain closed. Your hands sting from cold and torque.

The hatch behind you shudders again, heavier. Not a random slam: a repeated shove low on the latch-side, building force like something is bracing itself. Then the faint *tick-tick* returns—smaller, quicker—like a tool ratcheting.

Threat, clear: something on the other side is actively working the latch tongue, trying to walk it free.

The engineer’s voice cracks. “Elara—” he starts, then clamps his jaw shut like he’s trying not to pray by accident. He re-centers and says it louder, raw and ugly: “**Voss!** It’s— it’s *moving*—”

A sharp, distinct sound follows: the latch mechanism inside the hatch gives a tiny, unwilling *click*—not open, but no longer fully seated.

Consequence: the hatch is closer to popping than it was a moment ago, and the next shove may not be absorbed by the wheel-lock alone.

### Turn 82 [PLAYER]

“Good—keep saying my *name*, not numbers,” I snap, breath scraping. “If it pops, let the wheel go and climb. We live, or we don’t—no hymns.”

I wrench the second dog with both hands, then the third—no order, no cadence—kicking the frame with my heel to jar the brass free as I twist. “Come on—come on—” I hiss, fingers numb, and throw my shoulder up into the grate to test if it’ll drop the moment the last dog turns.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is about to give; I need the grate open now and to keep the engineer from freezing into prayer or rhythm. I’ll prioritize speed—force the remaining dogs, then get us into the crawl and pull the grate back in place as a barrier.*

### Turn 83 [GAME]

He latches onto your name like a handhold. “Voss—Voss—Voss,” he says, loud and ugly, each one a separate shove of breath. He keeps his weight on the wheel.

You wrench the second dog. It fights harder than the first—frozen threads, a burr of corrosion—until your heel-kick jars the frame. The dog jumps loose with a sharp squeal and snaps open.

Outcome: **second dog open.**

You go for the third without pattern, just need. It turns an eighth, stops dead. You kick again—harder. The grate frame shifts a millimeter in its seat and the dog suddenly gives, spinning the rest of the quarter-turn too fast. It slams into its open stop with a loud clack.

Outcome: **third dog open. One dog still locked.**

You shoulder the grate to test it.

It doesn’t drop. It *tilts*—just a finger’s width—because the last dog is still biting. That tiny tilt is enough to make the conduit bundle above you creak and shed a sprinkle of frost down your collar.

Behind you, the hatch answers with a decisive, mechanical change: a deeper *chunk* from inside the latch housing, like the tongue has been levered partway out of its keep. The wheel-lock shudders.

Threat made clear: **the hatch latch is being actively pried open from the corridor side**; it is no longer just “pushing,” it’s working the mechanism.

The engineer reacts exactly as you told him—no prayers, no hymns—just your name, and action. “Voss!” he yells, and then the hatch takes a full-body hit.

The wheel-lock holds for half a heartbeat, then the wheel jerks under his hands as the manifold spring-load surges. He loses purchase; the sleeve-jam tears free and flutters down like a shed skin.

Outcome: **the AUX BAFFLE wheel spins back a fraction**, whining, and a thin gust of colder, thinner air knifes through the throat—enough to make your head ring and your fingertips tingle.

The hatch doesn’t fully blow, but the seam opens a hairline at the latch-side—visible now, a dark thread. Something wet and pale presses into that thread for an instant, testing the gap, then withdraws with a sound like suction.

The engineer abandons the wheel and stumbles toward you, grabbing at the conduit bundle to haul himself up. “Voss—Voss—” he gasps, eyes on the ceiling grate. “Last dog—where—” he can’t finish without rhythm, so he just points with a shaking hand at the **bottom-right** corner of the grate.

### Turn 84 [PLAYER]

I lunge for the bottom-right dog and twist with both hands, snarling, “Voss—say it, keep it ugly,” then slam my heel into the frame to jar it as I force the quarter-turn. “As soon as it drops, you go first—don’t look back.”

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is starting to gap and whatever’s outside is probing; we need the grate open immediately and get both of us into the crawl. The engineer is panicking but responsive to my name—use that to move him. No time to re-baffle properly.*

### Turn 85 [GAME]

Your hands bite the bottom-right dog. It’s colder than the others—cold enough that the brass feels tacky, like skin to a tongue. You twist anyway.

It won’t go. Not at first. The slot-head edges chew at your grip through your sleeve, and you feel the dog flex against the grate frame instead of turning—metal complaining, threads frozen and slightly cross-seated.

You slam your heel into the frame.

The impact jolts the whole assembly; the dog jumps a fraction, then finally starts to rotate. It goes in ugly increments—stop, grind, stop—until it hits the quarter-turn and *snaps* into the open position with a loud, clean clack.

Outcome: **all four dogs are open. The grate is now free.**

Consequence: the grate doesn’t “drop” neatly. It sags, then falls outward and down in a sudden sheet of weight. You manage to keep it from fully crashing by catching an edge with your forearm, but it still slams the conduit bundle on the way, making the lines sway and throw a shower of frost and grit into your face.

At the same instant, the hatch behind you gives up another notch—an unmistakable internal *click* followed by the seam widening from a hairline to a finger-width at the latch-side. Something presses into the gap again, harder: pale, wet, jointed—more like a hand that learned bones from watching hands.

Threat: **the hatch is opening; whatever is outside can now reach through.**

The engineer scrambles exactly as ordered. “Voss,” he barks—hoarse, ugly—then he doesn’t look back. He plants a boot on the conduit brace, grabs the opened grate frame, and hauls himself up into the ceiling return. His heel kicks the dangling grate as he goes, making it swing and clatter.

He gets his torso into the dark duct and reaches one arm back blindly, fingers spread, searching for you without turning his head. “Voss—hand!” he spits, like the word is a tool.

From the hatch gap comes a new sound: a soft, eager inhalation through the opening, followed by the scrape of something dragging along the seam toward the wheel-lock—seeking the next point to widen.

### Turn 86 [PLAYER]

I spit frost from my teeth and grab his forearm hard. “Pull—now,” I snarl, then kick the dangling grate out of my way as I haul myself up after him. As I climb, I throw a single glance back at the gap and whisper, “Not my name,” like a warning to the thing—or to myself.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is already admitting a reaching limb; if I hesitate to observe, it will learn my shape. I trust the engineer’s outstretched hand and choose flight, but I can’t resist one last sensory note—those “learned bones” matter to my work and my grief.*

### Turn 87 [GAME]

His forearm is slick with condensation and shaking from strain, but your grip locks. He *pulls*—hard—using his whole back against the duct lip. Your kick sends the dangling grate swinging aside; it clips the conduit brace with a metallic ring and then hangs at an angle, leaving you a clean opening.

Outcome: you get your shoulders up and through. Your hips catch for a second on the frame; fabric snags and tears with a dry rip, then you’re in—knees scraping metal, palms sliding on frost-slick ducting.

The service junction drops away beneath you. The air in the return is thinner, colder, and tastes like old insulation and ozone. Your breath comes out as a fine white stream that doesn’t quite dissipate—clinging to the duct’s corners.

You glance back.

The hatch seam below is now wide enough for a forearm. Something pushes through—pale, wet, jointed wrong, with skin that looks too smooth to have ever known air. It doesn’t reach for the wheel-lock. It reaches upward, toward the open grate like it already understands “up.”

When you whisper, “Not my name,” the thing pauses mid-reach.

Then, from the corridor side, a voice answers—not spoken through the gap so much as *shaped* by it, as if the metal is a throat: a thin, intimate approximation of your cadence.

“...E-la-ra...”

Not your full name. Not yet. But close enough that your molars ache.

The engineer hears it too. He jerks forward in the duct, dragging you by sheer panic, and hisses, “Don’t—don’t answer it, Voss—don’t *teach* it!”

Consequence: your retreat is fast but messy. The swinging grate below continues to clatter softly against the brace, a repeating metal cue that marks the opening. Behind you, you hear the first scrape of that jointed limb against the duct lip—testing purchase, starting to climb.

### Turn 88 [PLAYER]

I clamp a hand over my own mouth, then grab the engineer’s ankle and squeeze once—hard—our new signal for *move, no words*. As we crawl, I reach back with my boot and hook the swinging grate, trying to wedge it up into the frame to stop the clatter; if it won’t catch, I yank my torn fabric loose and jam it between grate and brace to deaden the sound.

*Agent reasoning: Answering it could “teach” it my voice and rhythm; we need silence and misdirection, plus stop that grate from marking our position.*

### Turn 89 [GAME]

Your palm seals your mouth; your own breath fogs your fingers and warms them just enough to sting. You catch the engineer’s ankle and squeeze once—hard.

He understands immediately. No reply. He just *moves*—elbows and knees driving, boots scraping in short, efficient shoves. The duct amplifies every contact into a dry rasp, but it’s steadier than speech.

You reach back with your boot, feeling for the swinging grate through the opening below. You hook an edge and try to lever it up into its seat.

Outcome: **it won’t re-seat.** The frame is slightly warped from your heel strikes; the grate catches, then slips free with a sharp *ting* as gravity wins again. The clatter returns—softer now, but regular.

You go to the second plan. You yank at the torn fabric at your hip—already half-ripped from the climb—and peel a long strip free with a quiet, vicious tear. You jam it down between grate and brace.

Outcome: **sound dampened.** The next swing hits cloth instead of metal: a muted *thup* and a hiss of fibers. The clatter becomes an occasional dull bump, no longer a beacon.

Consequence: that fabric doesn’t just deaden noise—it *catches*. The grate’s angle changes, held slightly more open than before, like a mouth propped with a gag.

Below, the jointed limb finds the lip again. You hear it: wet skin on metal, then a small, searching tap—tap—tap along the duct edge, as if it’s reading the shape. When it brushes the jammed cloth, it stops.

A slow pull follows. Not strong—curious. Testing.

Threat made clear: **whatever is climbing has found the cloth and is using it to locate the opening; it may also use it as a grip.**

The engineer crawls faster, boots thudding in a hurry he can’t fully silence. At a junction seam ahead, the duct narrows slightly; he shoulders through and drags a wake of frost behind him.

From behind, through the opening you can’t see anymore, that corridor-voice shapes itself again—closer than it should be, as if the duct is learning to speak.

“...Voss...”

Not shouted. Not coaxing. Just *placed*—like a marker driven into ground.

### Turn 90 [PLAYER]

I bite down on my sleeve and yank the jammed strip free with a sharp, silent pull, then shove the loose cloth forward into the duct to keep it from dangling as a ladder. I squeeze the engineer’s ankle twice—*faster*—and, without speaking, press my forehead to the cold metal and force my breathing into slow, even counts, refusing the duct my voice.

*Agent reasoning: It’s learning my name and using the cloth as a guide; I need to remove its grip and keep us moving without feeding it more sound—also steady the engineer with touch, not words.*

### Turn 91 [GAME]

Your teeth clamp sleeve. You reach back blind and *rip* the jammed strip free in one sharp pull.

Outcome: **the cloth comes loose.** The grate immediately swings once, lightly, and then settles into a quieter sway—no longer held open by the jam.

You shove the strip forward into the duct ahead of you, bunching it into a wad so nothing hangs down.

Outcome: **no dangling “ladder.”** Whatever was testing the fabric loses that easy purchase.

The engineer feels the double squeeze on his ankle and surges forward, faster—still silent, but now frantic enough that his boot heels start striking the duct skin with a dull, repeating thud. He doesn’t look back. He just keeps going, shoulders tight, as if he’s trying to outrun a thought.

You press your forehead to the metal and lock your breathing into slow counts.

Outcome: **it helps—partly.** The duct doesn’t get your voice. It does get your heartbeat. With your cheek against the return, you feel a faint vibration syncing to your pulse, like the ship is “listening” through bone.

Behind you, at the opening, the wet scrape pauses. Then comes a different sound: a careful, patient *click*—not mechanical. Like a joint learning a hinge. The limb tries again, not pulling on cloth now but hooking fingertips (too many joints) over the duct lip.

Threat: **it is climbing anyway, using the metal itself.** It’s slower without the fabric, but it’s not stopped.

Then the corridor-voice returns—closer, cleaner, less distorted. It doesn’t ask for your name this time. It offers one, softly, as if reminding you.

“E-la-ra.”

The engineer finally breaks silence in a whisper that’s more breath than word, barely audible: “Keep… counting.”

Ahead, the duct seam you’re crawling toward has a maintenance grille—smaller than the one you came through—its screws painted with old wax marks. The air beyond it is warmer by a fraction, enough that frost beads instead of feathers.

### Turn 92 [PLAYER]

I tap the engineer’s boot twice, then point ahead to the wax-marked maintenance grille and mime twisting a screw—*quiet, now*. I slide forward, brace my shoulder against the duct, and start picking at the waxed screws with my fingertips, trying to crack them loose without a single spoken sound, counting in my head as “E-la-ra” scrapes at the back of my skull.

*Agent reasoning: Speaking is dangerous; I need to get us out through the maintenance grille while keeping the engineer steady and not feeding the thing my voice. The wax marks suggest the grille is meant to be opened—maybe quickly—so I’ll signal and work on it silently.*

### Turn 93 [GAME]

Your two taps land; the engineer freezes mid-crawl, then nods once without turning. He shifts his weight off his heels, distributing it to elbows and knees—quieter.

You slide up to the wax-marked grille. The screws aren’t just threaded—they’re *capped* in a thin, amber prayer-lacquer that has seeped into the slots. Your fingertips worry at the wax, flaking it away in tiny curls.

Outcome: you **crack the first seal**.

The moment the wax lattice fractures, the duct changes. Not in sound—at first in *pressure*. A faint warmth leaks through the seam like breath from a mouth, and the choir behind the bulkheads swells from “background” to nearly audible. Your own exhale returns to you half a beat late, shaped into the beginning of a syllable you didn’t speak.

A memory—uninvited, sharp—snags on the exposed current: your lover’s laugh, bright and ordinary, loops once… then repeats, flattened into a refrain. The metal under your forehead subtly warms, as if something has turned its attention toward this exact point in the duct.

The engineer’s head snaps around. His eyes are wide and wet in the dim return-light. He mouths, silently: *Stop.*

Behind you, the climbing sound accelerates—wet joints finding rhythm on metal. Not flailing now. Purposeful. It’s coming up the way you came.

You keep working the screw without speaking; your nails dig, and the wax gives with a soft crackle.

Outcome: you **can loosen the screw a fraction**, but the price is immediate: the chorus swells again, and your own voice—your cadence—answers from the seam in a whisper-thin harmony.

“…E-la-ra…”

Threat is now clear and close: **the broken wax has turned this grille into a beacon.** Whatever is in the duct is climbing toward the warmth and the looped laugh; whatever is in the ship is listening through the exposed lattice.

You can still withdraw—if you can re-seal or shut this grille back down before it “opens” any further.

### Turn 94 [PLAYER]

I freeze, meet the engineer’s eyes, and give a single sharp nod—*stop*. I smear the loosened wax back into the screw head with my thumb and press my torn cloth wad hard over the cracked seam like a muffler, then motion him to crawl—now—while I keep my palm clamped to the grille until the chorus dulls.

*Agent reasoning: The waxed grille is amplifying the ship’s attention and my own echo; opening it further risks drawing both the climber and the choir. I need to re-seal fast and move, even if it costs us the exit.*

### Turn 95 [GAME]

You nod once. The engineer exhales soundlessly and obeys—he pulls forward on his forearms, careful now, pushing his weight along the duct ribs without letting his boots drum.

You smear wax back into the screw head with your thumb.

Outcome: **partial reseal.** The wax fills the slot again, but it doesn’t bond the way it was—your body heat has softened it. It’s a plug, not a lock.

You press the wadded cloth over the cracked seam and clamp your palm down until your skin numbs.

Outcome: **the “beacon” dulls.** The warmth leaking through the seam is muffled; the chorus drops from a near-audible swell to a distant pressure in your teeth. The delayed echo of your breath stops trying to form syllables.

But the ship doesn’t forget immediately.

For three slow heartbeats, the metal under your hand *pushes back*—not moving, not swelling, just a subtle, steady pressure as if something on the other side is leaning its ear against your palm. Your thumbprint briefly burns hot, then cools to dead cold.

The engineer crawls on, gaining distance. He looks back once, eyes asking if you’re coming, then forces himself to keep moving.

Behind you, the wet climb reaches the level of the grille you just muffled. You hear it clearly now: a multi-jointed hand testing the duct wall, then the lip of the seam. It pauses at the cloth-covered crack and makes a soft, dissatisfied sound—like a throat clearing without air.

Threat: **it is within a few body-lengths of you in the duct, and it knows there was an opening here.**

It doesn’t retreat. Instead, it starts tapping along the duct’s underside, searching for the next weak point—tap… tap… tap—moving forward in the same direction you and the engineer are going.

Your muffling worked, but it also bought you only one thing: **time.**

### Turn 96 [PLAYER]

I peel my hand off the muffled grille and crawl after the engineer, keeping low and quiet; as I go, I hook my boot against a duct rib and give it one deliberate, dull *thump* behind us—then another a few feet later—trying to draw the tapping thing to the wrong spot while I clamp my sleeve over my mouth and keep counting in my head.

*Agent reasoning: Staying still will let it close the distance; I can’t risk another “listening” seam, so I’ll follow the engineer and try to misdirect the creature with sound/vibration while keeping my own voice sealed.*

### Turn 97 [GAME]

You peel your hand away. The cloth stays stuck for a moment—warm wax clinging—then releases with a soft tacky pull. The seam gives a faint sigh of warmer air, but it doesn’t flare back into song.

You crawl after the engineer, keeping your body tight to the duct floor. Your sleeve over your mouth turns your breath into damp heat against your wrist.

You hook your boot against a rib and give a deliberate dull *thump* behind you.

Outcome: **it works—immediately.** The tapping stops. For a half-second there’s only the engineer’s careful pull ahead and the thin rasp of your own fabric.

Then: a wet, jointed *scuttle* toward the sound. Fast. Confident. Whatever is behind you commits to the last vibration it heard.

You crawl another few feet and thump again.

Outcome: **you pull it off your trail—partly.** The scuttle overshoots the first thump and snaps to the second, scraping along the underside of the duct where you can feel the vibration through your ribs. It’s close enough now that the metal trembles under its weight.

The engineer hears it too. He flinches, then forces himself forward harder—still quiet, but faster. He reaches a cross-seam where the duct narrows and twists left. At the bend, there’s a strip of older insulation hanging like skin.

Behind you, the thing tests the duct ribs where you thumped—fingers probing, nails (or something like nails) dragging in short, irritated strokes. It makes a soft clicking that isn’t echolocation so much as *counting*, as if it’s matching intervals.

Consequence: **your decoy buys you distance but raises the tempo.** It’s learned you can “throw” sound, and it starts tapping back—rapid, patterned—searching for your reply.

Ahead, the engineer pauses at the left twist and finally risks a whisper, so thin it’s almost just breath: “There—junction… drop.”

The duct bend is now your next immediate hazard: it’s tight enough you’ll have to turn one shoulder down and slide, and the insulation curtain will brush your face and hands—no way through without contact. Meanwhile the tapping behind you resumes, closer again, and not fooled this time—moving in steady increments toward your last thump-point, then beyond it.

### Turn 98 [PLAYER]

I grab a fistful of the hanging insulation and pull it across the bend like a curtain, then shove the engineer through first with a hard push to his boot. As I follow, I let the insulation drag over my face and neck to hide our scent/heat, then twist sideways and slide into the junction drop without a sound, one hand clamped over my mouth as I count in my skull.

*Agent reasoning: The tapping is learning my tricks; we need to break line-of-sound now. The insulation will contaminate me with whatever the ship is shedding, but the drop is our only escape—I'll use the hanging insulation as a temporary veil and take the rear to buy the engineer time.*

### Turn 99 [GAME]

You seize the hanging insulation and yank it across the bend.

Outcome: **you make a crude curtain**, but it’s not clean—fibers tear free in your fist. A dry, peppery dust blooms in the narrow air and sticks to your damp sleeve.

You shove the engineer by the boot. He jolts forward, catches himself, and slips through the twist left—quiet, but not silent. His knee clips the duct wall with a muted *tok*. He winces and keeps going.

You follow immediately, letting the insulation drag across your face and neck.

Outcome: **it masks heat for a moment and costs you skin.** The fibers are laced with brittle foil strands; they scrape like wire-brush. Your cheek stings, and a line of cold wetness starts along your jaw. The dust clots in your throat behind your clamped hand.

At the junction drop, you turn sideways and slide.

Outcome: **successful silent drop—almost.** You control your descent, boots finding the edge, and you slip down into the darker throat below with only a soft fabric hiss.

Above you, at the bend, the tapping stops.

A hand—too many joints, moving wrong—pushes into the insulation curtain. It doesn’t tear it away immediately. It *pets* it, slow, as if reading the shape of what just passed. Then it presses harder and the curtain bows inward.

The engineer lands below you in a crouch, eyes wide, one hand up as if to steady you. He doesn’t speak. His lips move in a count that matches yours.

The thing’s head—or what serves as one—tilts at the bend. You hear a wet inhale that isn’t breathing so much as sampling.

Threat, clear and immediate: **it has reached the bend and is deciding whether to follow down the drop.** The insulation bought you seconds, not safety.

Then a new sound: a faint metallic *chime* from somewhere deeper in the service junction throat—like a small tool striking pipe. Not you. Not the engineer.

Someone else is down here.

### Turn 100 [PLAYER]

I grab the engineer’s wrist and squeeze twice—*hold*—then point down the throat and trace a question mark in the air. Keeping my sleeve over my mouth, I pull a small shard of torn foil-fiber from my cheek and flick it up toward the drop opening to make a soft decoy-rustle above, while my eyes strain into the dark for whoever struck that chime.

*Agent reasoning: The chime means a living person—or a lure. I need to keep the engineer quiet, avoid drawing the thing down the drop, and identify who’s below without using my voice.*

### Turn 101 [GAME]

Your fingers close on the engineer’s wrist. Two squeezes.

Outcome: **he freezes.** His shoulders lock, breath held. He follows your point, then your traced question mark, and gives the smallest possible nod—he understood: *who’s down there?*

You keep your sleeve over your mouth and pinch a torn foil-fiber shard from your cheek. It comes away with a tiny sting and a smear of your blood on the silver.

You flick it upward toward the drop opening.

Outcome: **the decoy-rustle happens—and it draws attention, but not the way you want.** The shard skitters against duct metal above with a soft *tssk… tssk*, like dry leaves.

At the bend overhead, the wet inhale stops. A beat later: a sharp, deliberate *tap*—right at the lip of the drop. Not searching now. Marking.

Then weight shifts. The insulation curtain is pushed aside. Something braces itself at the edge, and a thin line of colder air pours down as the upper duct is disturbed.

Down the throat, your eyes adjust enough to catch movement: not a person standing, but someone **crouched behind a service strut**—a silhouette with a Concord hard-helmet profile and a tool in hand. The tool glints once and you recognize the source of the chime: a small wrench or spanner, still vibrating.

The crouched figure sees you. Instead of calling out, they raise two fingers in a quick signal—*quiet*—then point urgently at the wall beside you.

You follow their point: a **wheel-lock hatch** half a meter to your right, its rim wax-marked. The wheel is already loosened a fraction, like someone started opening it and stopped.

Above you: the thing begins to descend. You hear the first contact—jointed fingers on the drop edge—then a slow, careful scrape as it tests how to come down without falling.

Threat: **it is entering the drop now.** You have seconds before it’s in the throat with you.

### Turn 102 [PLAYER]

I tug the engineer hard toward the wheel-lock hatch and press my fingers to my lips at him—*no sound*—then I grip the loosened wheel and turn it as silently as I can, easing the hatch open just enough to slip him through first. As he goes, I flick my eyes to the helmeted silhouette and mouth, “Friend?” before sliding in after the engineer and pulling the hatch toward closed without letting it clang.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is the only immediate cover, and the newcomer seems to know this junction; I’ll trust their silent signal and get the engineer through before the thing drops into the throat.*

### Turn 103 [GAME]

You haul the engineer by the sleeve to the wheel-lock hatch and press *no sound* at him. He swallows hard and moves, keeping his boots close to the deck.

You take the loosened wheel in both hands and turn.

Outcome: **it opens—quietly at first.** The wheel gives with a dense, greased resistance like old joints. You ease the hatch inward a few centimeters; a seam of darker air leaks out, colder than the throat, carrying a faint chemical tang—sealant and old incense.

You angle the opening just enough. The engineer slips through sideways, shoulders hunched, one hand braced on the rim so he doesn’t scrape. He disappears into the dark beyond.

You glance to the helmeted silhouette and mouth, “Friend?”

They answer without voice: a sharp head shake—*no*—then a quick gesture: two fingers to their own visor, then down the corridor—*Concord.* Their free hand points again at the hatch, urgent: *close it.*

Above, the thing’s descent accelerates. You hear its weight come off the lip and onto the drop wall—fingers and feet finding purchase in alternating, insectlike beats. It is **coming down now**, committed.

You slide into the hatch after the engineer and pull it toward closed.

Outcome: **you almost get it shut without a sound—almost.** The hatch edge kisses the frame with a soft *thuk*… and then the wax-marked rim catches on a burr. It makes a tiny, bright *tink* as metal meets metal.

In the throat outside, the descending thing stops mid-wall. Absolute stillness for half a heartbeat.

Then: a single wet click, and a slow, purposeful scrape toward the hatch seam—like it’s orienting to the new sound.

Inside the hatch space, you and the engineer are in a cramped service run—unincensed, darker, with condensation slick on the walls. The engineer’s eyes are huge; he holds his breath, waiting on your hands.

Outside, the helmeted Concord figure doesn’t follow you in. They flatten themselves behind the strut again, tool raised, as if preparing to distract—or to strike—if the thing reaches the deck.

Threat is immediate and specific: **the thing is now tracking along the drop wall toward your hatch seam, and your hatch is not fully seated.**

### Turn 104 [PLAYER]

I grit my teeth and press my bleeding cheek against the hatch edge to muffle it, then work my fingertips along the burr, scraping it down as quietly as I can and easing the wheel that last fraction to seat the seal. I tap the inside of the hatch twice in a tight rhythm—*now*—hoping the Concord figure hears and makes a noise away from the seam, while I pull the engineer close and whisper into his ear, barely air: “Don’t move. Don’t breathe loud.”

*Agent reasoning: The hatch isn’t seated and any more noise will bring it right to us; I need a silent seal and a diversion, even if it costs me skin. The Concord silhouette might help if I signal without sound.*

### Turn 105 [GAME]

You press your cut cheek into the hatch edge. The cold metal bites; your blood slicks the rim and **kills the last little metallic chatter**.

With your fingertips you find the burr—sharp as a tooth—and worry at it. Skin catches. You force yourself to go slow anyway, scraping it down millimeter by millimeter.

Outcome: **you seat the hatch.** The wheel turns that final fraction with a tight, reluctant give, and the hatch settles into its frame. The seam goes from a hairline gap to a firm, even join. The chemical tang fades as the seal takes.

You tap twice from the inside: *now.*

Outside, through the metal, you hear the Concord figure respond—not with speech, but with action. A quick series of deliberate noises moves away from your seam: a spanner rapped against pipe (*chime—chime*), then a boot scuff, then another brighter *clang* farther down the throat.

The thing reacts immediately. On the other side of your hatch, you hear its slow scrape pause—then shift. Its joints make a faint, wet ticking as it reorients toward the new sound. It drags itself along the wall, away from your door, following the clangs.

But it doesn’t leave cleanly.

A moment later, something brushes the outside of your hatch—light, testing. Not a strike. A fingertip, tracing the wax-marked rim as if reading it. The pressure increases just enough to make the hatch creak deep in its hinges.

Then it withdraws.

The engineer is pressed to you in the cramped run, trembling. You whisper into his ear. He nods once, eyes squeezed shut, and forces his breathing into shallow, silent sips.

Outside: the Concord figure makes one last noise—sharp and close to painful, like metal snapped against metal—then you hear them run. Fast. Not away from you—away from the thing.

The threat shifts: **the hatch is sealed for now, but the thing has confirmed this door exists and has followed the Concord decoy deeper into the throat.** If the decoy fails, it may come back to the wax-marked seam with purpose.

No new voices inside your service run—only the engineer’s barely-contained panic and the distant, receding wet ticks as the thing pursues.

### Turn 106 [PLAYER]

I press my forehead to the hatch for one last listen, then pull the engineer gently by the sleeve deeper into the run, guiding his hand to the wall so he can follow without stumbling. “In through the nose,” I breathe, barely sound, “count with me—four, hold, four.” As we move, I wipe my blood along the seam of the corridor behind us in a smeared arc, trying to confuse whatever reads wax and scent, and I scan the dark for a secondary panel, ladder, anything that leads away from the throat.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is sealed but marked; staying here risks it returning. The engineer is panicking, so I need to steady him and move deeper into the service run, while also acknowledging the Concord decoy’s sacrifice and looking for another exit or a way to mask our trace.*

### Turn 107 [GAME]

Forehead to metal: you listen.

Outcome: **the throat outside is quieter, but not safe.** The wet ticking is farther away now, layered under a faint, irregular rattle—like something being dragged. Once, very distant, a Concord voice breaks discipline: a single sharp shout cut off into a choke of static through the ductwork. Then only the ship’s slow, devotional vibration.

You pull the engineer by the sleeve into the service run. He keeps one hand on the wall like a blind man, knuckles white. You breathe the count. He tries—fails on the first hold, then matches you on the second, shallow and controlled.

As you move, you smear your blood in an arc along the seam behind you.

Outcome: **it leaves a strong, coppery trail in the cold air.** The smear isn’t subtle; it’s a deliberate mark. If something reads scent, you’ve given it more to read—unless the point is to make the direction ambiguous. The arc does that: the blood isn’t a line forward, it’s a crescent that could mean “here” as much as “gone.”

Your eyes adjust to the unincensed dark. You find structure by touch and reflected frost-sheen:

- On your left, two meters in: a **secondary service panel** with a brass latch, slightly proud of the wall—recently opened and shut, the screws not fully seated.
- Ahead, the run drops into a narrow vertical: a **ladder well** with rungs slick with condensation. A faint draft rises from it, colder, carrying the dry smell of exposed insulation and old ozone.
- On the right, near the ladder well: a **maintenance grille** wax-marked with the same candle-script as the hatch—three short strokes and a tear-shaped seal.

Behind you, from the hatch you sealed: a new sound answers your blood-smear—**a slow, careful scrape on the other side of the metal**, not at the seam now but higher, as if something has put its weight against the hatch and is listening with its whole body.

Threat: **it has returned to your door and is testing it without striking—yet.** The engineer’s breathing starts to climb again as he hears it, and his boot sole squeaks once on the wet deck.

He clamps down, eyes wide at you, silently begging for what to do next.

### Turn 108 [PLAYER]

I grab the engineer’s chin gently and tilt it toward me. “Eyes on me—four, hold, four,” I whisper, then guide him to the wax-marked maintenance grille and press my ear to it for a heartbeat before slipping my fingers under the edge to ease it open without a rattle. “If it comes through that hatch,” I murmur, “you follow my hand, not your fear,” and I motion him through the grille first.

*Agent reasoning: The scrape means it’s triangulating—staying here risks a sudden breach. The wax-marked grille feels like a “sanctified” route the thing might hesitate to follow, and the draft from the ladder well could carry our scent. I’ll take the waxed path and keep the engineer calm and quiet.*

### Turn 109 [GAME]

You take his chin—careful, firm—and pull his focus back from the hatch. He blinks like he’s surfacing.

“In through the nose,” you whisper. “Four… hold… four.”

Outcome: **he follows you.** Not perfectly, but enough that his shoulders drop a fraction and his breathing stops rasping. His eyes stay on yours as you guide him to the wax-marked grille.

You press your ear to the grille.

On the other side: **a thin, steady airflow** and a faint, layered sound like distant singing heard through a wall of water—no words, just a pressure on the eardrum. Closer than that, a soft, intermittent tick-tick—metal cooling or something moving very slowly along duct ribs. No human voices.

You get your fingers under the grille edge and ease.

Outcome: **it opens without a rattle—almost.** The wax seal stretches like warm skin and gives with a quiet, tacky *peel*. The hinge holds; the grille swings out a handspan. Cold air spills over your knuckles.

You murmur to him, “Follow my hand, not your fear,” and motion him through first.

He nods once, jaw clenched, and starts to climb in—hands first, then shoulders. Halfway through, his belt catches on the lower lip. He freezes, panic flaring; you see him about to jerk.

At the same instant, behind you at the sealed hatch: **a new pressure hits the metal from the outside—harder, decisive.** Not a full slam, but a testing shove that makes the wheel-lock groan deep in its housing.

Then a sound you haven’t heard yet: **a wet inhalation**, drawn right against the hatch like something trying to taste the air through the seal.

The engineer’s belt is still caught. If he yanks, it will scrape loud against the grille edge. If you leave him, he may bolt. If you stay, the thing on the other side of the hatch is now actively investigating—close enough that any noise here will matter.

### Turn 110 [PLAYER]

I slide in tight behind him, clamp a steadying hand on his hip, and whisper, “Still—don’t pull.” With my other hand I press my blood-slick fingers between belt and metal lip, easing the fabric free in slow millimeters to keep it from scraping. As soon as it slips, I guide him forward into the duct, then follow through and draw the grille toward closed, holding it firmly to stop any rattle while I listen for the hatch behind us.

*Agent reasoning: He’s about to panic and make noise; I can’t abandon him, but I also can’t let that thing triangulate us. I’ll quietly free the belt and use my own blood-slick hand to muffle any scrape, then get us both through and re-seat the grille.*

### Turn 111 [GAME]

You slide in tight behind him, pin his hip with a steady hand, and whisper, “Still—don’t pull.”

Outcome: **he obeys.** He goes rigid, breath caught in his throat, and you feel the tremor running through his pelvis and legs—but he doesn’t jerk.

Your other hand—blood-slick, cold-numb—worms between belt webbing and the grille’s lower lip. You work it free in slow millimeters.

Outcome: **it slips without a scrape.** The blood acts like lubricant; the belt slides over your fingers with a soft, damp rasp that stays inside the duct. The engineer exhales once, silently, like he’s been holding his life in his teeth.

You guide him forward into the duct. He crawls, careful now, one knee then the other, palms flat to keep from clanging on the ribs. You follow, shoulders squeezing through, and pull the grille toward closed.

Outcome: **you get it nearly shut and hold it steady—no rattle.** The wax at the hinge edge kisses back into place with a muted tack. Your fingers clamp the frame and you listen.

From the hatch behind you (through the wall and down the short run): the wheel-lock groans again, once—then stops. The wet inhalation returns, closer, longer, as if whatever is outside is drawing scent through microscopic gaps.

Then the sound changes.

A thin, hairline *skitter* travels along the deck seam on the far side of the hatch—fast, searching—and you realize it isn’t the Concord figure anymore making noise out there. It’s something **threaded low**, moving where metal meets metal.

The ship answers with a tiny betrayal: the duct you’re in vibrates with the same frequency as your heartbeat, as if it’s amplifying it.

The engineer’s sleeve brushes the duct wall ahead—barely audible—but immediately, outside, the seam-sound pauses.

A moment later: **a soft ripple under the hatch threshold**, like a living filament flexing against the metal. It doesn’t force the hatch. It doesn’t need to—it's testing for vibration, for voice, for warm skin near the floor.

The engineer looks back at you in the duct’s dim, eyes huge. He doesn’t speak. He mouths, silently: *what is that?*

Whatever is out there is now **at the sealed hatch seam**, listening with something that isn’t ears.

### Turn 112 [PLAYER]

I press two fingers to my own throat—*no voice*—then touch his wrist and squeeze twice, slow, to anchor him. With my lips near his ear I breathe, barely there, “Not ears. It reads tremor… heat,” and I start crawling deeper into the duct at a glacial pace, pausing every few inches to let the metal go still. As we move, I force my heartbeat down—counting in fours—and tilt my head, listening for the psalm-whispers to tell me which way the duct “wants” us to go.

*Agent reasoning: Sound will kill us; the filament is reading vibration and warmth, so we need to stop moving, slow our bodies, and get deeper into the duct away from the deck seam. I also need to keep the engineer from panicking and making noise, and I want to understand what the ship is “hearing” through me.*

### Turn 113 [GAME]

You press two fingers to your throat—no voice—and the engineer nods fast, swallowing sound. Your squeeze on his wrist steadies him; his next breath is smaller, controlled.

You put your mouth near his ear anyway and leak only the thinnest air: “Not ears. It reads tremor… heat.”

Outcome: **the words cost you.** Not because they’re loud—they aren’t—but because the duct skin takes them like a confession. The metal under your cheek gives a faint answering *thrumm*, as if the ship repeats the shape of the sentence.

You start crawling deeper at a glacial pace, pausing to let the ribs go still.

Outcome: **you gain distance without drawing a chase.** The seam-thing at the hatch doesn’t force through. Instead, behind you, the sound changes from probing to *measuring*: intermittent, delicate taps—like a fingernail on glass—spaced in a pattern that matches your pauses too closely to be random.

The engineer follows your hand-signals. He keeps his knees off the loudest ribs. His breath fogs the duct, then thins.

You force your heartbeat down—count in fours—and tilt your head to listen for the psalm-whispers.

They come. Not a chorus at first—**a single line**, close and intimate, as if spoken from inside the duct wall:

*—left, left, left—*

The words aren’t in any human tongue, but your brain translates them as direction anyway. With the phrase comes a physical cue: the air on the left branch tastes faintly of burnt copper and warmed insulation; the right branch is colder, cleaner, almost dead.

At the next junction the duct splits:  
- **Left**: a slight upward grade; warmer draft; faint amber pulse-light leaking through screw holes.  
- **Right**: level; colder; silence so complete it feels padded.

As you hesitate, the engineer’s wrist under your fingers twitches—an involuntary tremor.

Behind you, far back at the grille: **a soft, satisfied click**, like something finding purchase on the duct’s outer skin. Not inside with you—yet—but on the other side of the sheet metal, tracking.

And from somewhere below the left branch, a human sound threads up through the duct: **a muffled cough**, then a voice trying not to be a voice—one of the trapped medics, close enough that you can hear the strain in it.

They’re alive. And they’re near the warmer path.

### Turn 114 [PLAYER]

I squeeze the engineer’s wrist again—two slow pulses—then point left and press my palm flat to the duct, willing it to steady. “Hold your breath on the turns,” I mouth, barely any air, and we crawl into the warmer branch inch by inch, pausing with each amber pulse to let the metal stop singing. As we go, I angle my face toward the cough and whisper just once, thin as thread, “Medic—stay still. We’re coming,” then fall silent and listen for that outer-skin tracking to follow or hesitate.

*Agent reasoning: The whispers insist on left and there are living medics there; Elara will risk the warmer route despite it being more detectable, but she’ll try to manage tremor/heat and keep the engineer anchored.*

### Turn 115 [GAME]

You give the engineer the two slow pulses. He matches you—jaw clenched, eyes wet, but present. You point left and press your palm to the duct wall.

Outcome: **the duct steadies—partly.** Your palm stops the local vibration, but the rest of the run still carries a low devotional hum, like the ship is waiting for you to make a mistake.

You mouth, *Hold your breath on the turns.* He nods once and does it—lungs held, shoulders tight—each time the duct angles.

You crawl into the warmer branch inch by inch, timing your pauses to the amber pulse leaking through screw holes.

Outcome: **your movement becomes almost inaudible.** The amber pulses continue regardless—slow, regular—like a heartbeat you didn’t consent to share.

You angle your face toward the cough and whisper, once: “Medic—stay still. We’re coming.”

Outcome: **the medic hears you—and reacts badly.** There’s a sharp, muffled inhale, then a stifled sob cut off mid-sound. A hand thumps once against whatever wall they’re behind, as if they tried to signal and forgot the rules. The thump travels up the duct as a clean, ringing tremor.

Immediately, on the duct’s outer skin behind you: the tracking sound **stops**—a full, attentive pause.

Then it resumes, faster and more certain: a series of tiny, rapid clicks sliding along the outside of the metal, keeping pace with the direction of that thump. It’s not guessing anymore. It’s following a line you just drew for it.

A second later the warmth in this branch spikes—like someone opened a vent to a room full of bodies—and with it comes a new smell: **hot wax and saline**.

Ahead, the duct ribs narrow slightly around a service collar. Beyond it, through a seam in the plating, you catch a sliver of the space you’re approaching: amber-lit, shrine-adjacent machinery… and the edge of a sealed corridor door with **wax runnels** thick along its frame.

From below that door, a voice—thin, forced stillness—hisses up, barely audible: “Don’t—don’t come through the—”

They cut off as if someone clamped a hand over their mouth.

Outside your duct, the clicking reaches the point directly behind you and changes into something else: **a gentle dragging**, as though a filament is being laid along the metal, testing heat through the sheet.

It’s close now—separated from your back by one layer of duct wall. You can feel the faintest localized cold where it touches, like frost forming in a line.

### Turn 116 [PLAYER]

I freeze, press my cheek to the metal until it hurts, and clamp my hand over the engineer’s mouth and nose just long enough to force a held breath, then release and signal *still* with two fingers. Keeping my body flat, I smear a thin line of my blood along the duct wall where the cold filament is testing, then inch forward through the service collar—slow enough the ribs don’t sing—pulling the engineer after me by the wrist. When my lips reach the seam showing the amber-lit space, I exhale a thread of air and whisper, “Quiet—don’t move. Tell me: what’s on the other side of that waxed door?” then go dead still to feel if the dragging hesitates at the blooded patch or follows our warmth.

*Agent reasoning: It’s tracking heat through the duct skin; if I keep moving it will stay on us. I need to break its read—reduce heat signature and vibration—while getting the engineer past the narrow collar and warning the medic to stay silent.*

### Turn 118 [PLAYER]

I go utterly still, cheek pressed to the duct until it aches, and clamp my hand over the engineer’s mouth a beat—*hold*—then release and flash two fingers: *still*. I smear a thin, deliberate line of my blood along the wall where the cold drag tests, then inch through the service collar with glacial care, tugging him after me by the wrist.  
With my lips at the seam over the amber-lit space, I breathe a thread and whisper, “Quiet—don’t move. What’s on the other side of that waxed door?” then freeze again, listening for whether the dragging hesitates at the blooded patch or follows our warmth.

*Agent reasoning: The filament is close enough to read our heat and tremor; the only chance is to stop all motion, mask the scent/heat signature with my blood as a decoy, and get intelligence from the medic without making them panic again.*

### Turn 120 [PLAYER]

I stay frozen, cheek welded to the duct, and keep my grip on the engineer’s wrist—steady, not pulling. I whisper through the seam again, barely air: “Don’t answer loud—tap once for *danger*, twice for *safe*. What’s behind the waxed door?” Then I stop breathing and wait, feeling for any hesitation where I smeared the blood.

*Agent reasoning: The outer-skin filament is close enough to feel; any sound or movement will give us away. I’ll use my blood as a decoy and get information from the medic without forcing them to move, then decide whether we risk the waxed door or keep crawling.*

### Turn 121 [GAME]

Your whisper makes it through. The space beyond the seam goes quiet in a way that isn’t natural—like someone held their whole body still to listen.

A moment later: a single, careful tap answers from below, against the waxed door or the bulkhead beside it. **One tap. _Danger._**

Then a second sound, not a tap—more like a fingernail dragged a short line through softened wax. A pause. Another tiny drag. Someone is trying to add detail without making noise.

Outside the duct, under your blood-smeared patch, the cold dragging **hesitates**—not stopping, but slowing as if it’s reading texture. The metal under your cheek blooms with pinprick frost that bites through skin. The filament tests the blood line again, tracing it, and you feel the temperature drop in a narrow stripe.

Then it **moves past** the blood and continues forward, following the warmer gradient of your bodies through the collar. It didn’t take the bait for long.

The engineer’s wrist in your hand twitches once—reflex, fear. He doesn’t pull away, but his tendons jump like he’s about to bolt.

From below, the muffled voice returns, even thinner, as if spoken through fabric: “It’s… not a room. It’s a—” A hand clamps down again; you hear the wet, panicked sound of someone swallowing a cry.

And then the waxed door itself makes a soft, deliberate sound: **a settling click**, like a latch choosing a position.

In the amber-lit gap you can see, the wax runnels along the doorframe **shiver** and sag a millimeter, as if warmed from the other side. A fresh bead forms and starts to crawl downward.

The immediate threat is clear now: whatever is laying that cold filament is **right alongside the duct, moving with you**, and the waxed door below is **actively changing state**—either sealing harder or preparing to open—while the people behind it are being forcibly silenced.

### Turn 122 [PLAYER]

I press my forehead to the duct and squeeze the engineer’s wrist hard—*don’t bolt*—then draw two slow circles on his skin: *back, quiet*. Through the seam I scrape my nail once, short, through the metal dust—*danger heard*—and breathe, “Don’t open it. Don’t move.”  

Then I start inching backward the way we came, not faster—just relentless—keeping my body flat and my breaths swallowed, trying to put distance between us and the waxed door before it decides to wake.

*Agent reasoning: The filament is tracking our heat, and the waxed door is about to change—opening would be catastrophic. I need to keep the engineer from panicking, warn the medic without sound, and move away from this seam before the thing aligns with us.*

### Turn 123 [GAME]

Your squeeze lands. The engineer’s wrist goes rigid, then—after a heartbeat—he gives you one tiny answering pressure: he understands. He follows, inch for inch, keeping his boots from scraping.

Your nail-scrape through the seam makes a faint grit-noise. Below, whoever is there answers with nothing—no taps, no drag in the wax. But you *do* hear a controlled exhale, like someone forcing themselves not to sob.

You begin backing out.

For three careful body-lengths, it works: you and the engineer slide backward through the service collar, shoulders flattening, elbows tucked. The amber seam narrows behind you.

Then the cold filament outside the duct **accelerates** to match your retreat. It isn’t random. It’s tracking the moving warmth.

The stripe of frost along the duct wall thickens where your blood was smeared, and the metal there **crackles**—a dry, brittle sound—as if the blood has become a conductive wick for cold. The filament tests that spot again, and this time it *doesn’t* slow.

A new sound joins it: a low, measured **knock** from the duct exterior—once… then a pause… then once again—like someone rapping a code you don’t know. Each knock comes from a slightly different point along the duct, keeping pace with you.

The engineer’s breathing finally betrays him: one involuntary inhale through his teeth.

Immediately, the cold outside surges. A needle-thin line of white creeps across a duct seam ahead of your shoulder—**not frost blooming naturally, but a line being drawn**, searching for a gap.

Behind you, the waxed door gives a second, louder decision-sound: **a click-and-drag**, and the amber light under it thins as if the door has seated tighter. The people on the other side have *not* opened it.

You gain distance from the seam, but the threat comes with you: the cold filament is now **probing the duct seams for an entry point**, and it has started to **knock**—as if coordinating with something that can hear breath through metal.

### Turn 124 [PLAYER]

I clamp my mouth to the engineer’s ear and whisper, “No more air—bite your sleeve if you have to,” then pull him tight against me so his chest movement doesn’t rattle the duct. I drag my bleeding palm hard across the nearest seam *ahead* of the creeping white line—smearing wide, not thin—then press my forearm over it like a tourniquet and hum one broken bar of the ship’s psalm off-key, trying to confuse the knock’s rhythm. If the seam starts to give, I kick once—sharp—at the duct rib behind us and commit: we scramble backward faster, risking noise to reach the last junction and drop into the cooler branch.

*Agent reasoning: The cold is using my blood as a conduit and probing for a seam—retreating slowly won’t save us. I need to break its “read” on our warmth and stop the engineer from breathing loud, even if it costs me pain or time.*

### Turn 125 [GAME]

You seal your mouth to his ear and whisper it. The engineer nods once and shoves his sleeve between his teeth. His next breath becomes a muffled, shaking pull of air through fabric. Better—still not silent, but blunted.

You smear your bleeding palm across the seam ahead of the creeping white line, wide and wet, and clamp your forearm over it. The blood spreads into the hairline join like dye into paper.

The probing frost hits your smear and **stops**—not because it’s fooled, but because it reacts. The seam under your forearm goes *numbingly* cold in a blink, and the blood **crystallizes** with a faint crackle, bonding to the metal like a brittle gasket. For two heartbeats, the needle-white line can’t draw forward.

You hum one broken bar of the ship’s psalm—off-key on purpose. The knocking outside the duct falters, loses its spacing… then answers you: **three knocks**, uneven, like a throat trying to mimic a melody without lungs.

That’s when you feel it: the duct isn’t just being traced. It’s being **listened to**.

Somewhere beyond the metal, a small, precise voice speaks—close enough that the consonants tick through the duct wall: “Volunteer tremor pattern. Breath suppression. Hymn-attempt.”

A soft chime follows, like a med-scanner confirming a reading.

Your kick lands hard on a rib behind you. The whole run of duct answers with a hollow *gong*. Dust shakes loose. The engineer flinches, but you’re already committing—scrambling backward faster, elbows and knees scraping.

The cold filament doesn’t try your blood-gasket again. It **goes around**—a line of frost races along a parallel seam, then another, leapfrogging to find an easier ingress.

You reach the last junction and drop into the cooler branch—shoulders first, then hips—both of you sliding into colder, thinner air.

The moment you’re in, a maintenance grille further down the cool branch **ticks**—not opening, but unlatching and relatching once, as if tested from the other side.

And behind you, back toward the warm run, the duct seam you smeared lets out a sharp, tiny sound: **a brittle snap**. Your blood-gasket has started to fracture.

### Turn 126 [PLAYER]

I press two fingers to the engineer’s throat—*no sound*—and guide his head down into the colder airflow, then crawl toward the ticking grille with my bloody palm held up like an offering. “Warden-Medic Sable Rhyne,” I murmur into the metal, and tap a slow, clean pattern: **three—pause—one**, then hum the *ending* of the psalm I just broke, softer, steadier. “If you can hear tremor, hear this too: I’m not your volunteer. Don’t open that grille unless you want it to follow.”

*Agent reasoning: The grille is being tested—someone is close. If it’s Sable, he’s tracking us medically; I need to stop the engineer from panicking and buy a second by making myself the signal, not our breath. I’ll try to communicate through the hymn—something only a confessor would dare—while moving us away from the fracturing seam.*

### Turn 127 [GAME]

Your two fingers on his throat do the job. The engineer swallows once, hard, and holds. You angle his face into the colder run; the thin air steals the urge to pant, turning breath into a sting he can’t afford to make loud.

You crawl toward the ticking grille. Your bloody palm, lifted, leaves a faint smear on the duct ceiling when you brush it—dark against the frost. The cool branch carries sound differently: your tap—**three, pause, one**—travels down the metal like a clean pulse.

For a second there’s only the duct’s own cold.

Then the voice returns, not close now—**directly behind the grille**, as if the speaker has put their mouth to it.

“Don’t use my full name,” Sable Rhyne says quietly. No anger, just a rule. You hear fabric shift, a knee repositioning. “And don’t hum at it.”

A small device chirps twice. Something is being actively monitored.

The grille ticks again—this time not a test, but a **manual latch being thumbed and held**. It does not open. A strip of light appears through the slats: pale, clinical, not the amber nave-glow.

“I can hear tremor,” Sable says. “I can hear the other thing too. It’s riding your duct like a wire.”

He exhales once—controlled, practiced. “If I open this, it may choose *me* instead of you. If I don’t, it may learn the seam pattern and come through anyway.”

You feel the cold filament react to your steadier hum: it stops knocking. Instead, a **slow, sliding pressure** begins along the duct wall behind you, as if something is laying its whole length against the metal to feel for vibration. The temperature drops in a broad band, not a line.

Sable lowers his voice further. “You’re bleeding. That makes you loud to it.”

A pause. Then: “Tell me what you have in your hand. The wax vial. Is it intact?”

As he speaks, the grille’s latch makes a soft **half-turn**—not opening, but preparing. He’s poised to make a decision fast.

The threat is immediate and specific: the “cold filament” has shifted from probing seams to **pressing and listening**, and if it finds a weak point near you or the grille, it will try to enter—either into the duct with you, or through the grille into Sable’s side.

### Turn 128 [PLAYER]

I still my breath and answer in a near-silent rasp, “Call me Voss, then. Yes—the wax vial’s intact.” I press the vial against the duct wall where the cold pressure is sliding, then smear a thick ring of wax around the nearest seam by touch, trying to dull vibration and seal a weak point. 

Without looking back, I tap the grille twice—*don’t open*—and whisper, “If you crack that latch, it’ll take your warmth; talk me through a vent purge or give me a chemical chill—anything to make us colder than it wants.”

*Agent reasoning: Sable needs fast, clear data; if the thing is listening for vibration, I should minimize sound and use the wax as bait or sealant—without opening the grille and handing him over.*

### Turn 129 [GAME]

“Voss,” Sable answers at once, taking the correction. The light behind the grille shifts as if he leans closer; you hear his glove brush the slats. “Good. Keep it sealed.”

You press the wax vial to the duct wall where the cold pressure is sliding. The wax doesn’t melt—there isn’t enough heat—but it **softens just slightly** under your palm’s warmth and the friction. When you smear it into a thick ring around the nearest seam, it does what you intended: the duct’s faint vibration **dulls**, becoming more of a dead thud than a singing plate.

The thing outside reacts immediately.

The broad cold band pauses, then **tightens**—not into a line, but into multiple thin strands you can feel through the metal: like fingers spreading to find edges. The temperature at your wax ring drops hard, trying to make the wax brittle.

A sharp, ugly sound follows: **a high metallic squeal** as something scrapes along the duct exterior right over your seal, testing it for give.

Sable hears it too. The grille latch stops moving.

“Okay,” he whispers. You hear him do something with a canister—cap twist, then a short shake. “You want colder than it wants? I can give you *dry* cold, not vent-cold. Vent purge will make you loud.”

A thin nozzle slips between the grille slats just enough that you can see it: matte steel, medical labeling scuffed off. He does **not** open the grille. He angles the nozzle down the duct toward you and the engineer.

“Two-second burst only,” he says. “Cover your eyes. Don’t inhale.”

He triggers it.

A white fog jets through the slats—chemical chill, bitter and desiccating. It hits your forearm, your cheek, the engineer’s sleeve. The duct interior instantly grows rimed; your wax ring **hardens**, going glassy.

The outside pressure **recoils**—you feel it lift away from the duct wall like a hand yanked off ice. The scraping stops.

But the fog has a cost: the engineer’s restrained breath catches. He jerks once, a stifled cough forced into cloth—still muffled, but it’s a *pulse* of sound.

From behind you, back up the cool branch, the knocking returns—one slow knock—then another—now closer than before, as if the filament has shifted position to flank you rather than force the waxed seam.

Sable’s voice goes tight. “It backed off the seal. It’s moving. Voss—how many meters to your junction?”

### Turn 130 [PLAYER]

“Five—maybe six meters,” I whisper, voice shaved down to nothing. I clamp my hand over the engineer’s mouth and nose just enough to stop the cough from becoming sound, then tug him after me and start crawling—fast, scraping be damned—toward the junction.

Into the grille, between breaths: “Rhyne—one more two-second burst, *behind us* if you can angle it. Then shut it and don’t move.”

*Agent reasoning: Sable needs actionable distance fast; the thing is flanking from behind, so we have to move now while the chill bought a moment. I’ll answer, then prioritize the engineer’s silence and push for the junction/cooler branch, asking Sable for one more burst at the rear if possible.*

### Turn 131 [GAME]

“Five—six,” Sable repeats, committing it like a dosage.

You clamp the engineer’s face. He fights you for half a second—panic, reflex—then yields, eyes wide and wet. The cough dies in your palm as a trembling, silent spasm. His next breath is a thin leak through your fingers.

You haul him forward and crawl hard. The duct punishes speed: elbows skid on frost, knees bang ribs, and each impact sends a dull *thunk* down the run.

Behind you, the knocking answers that new noise immediately—no longer slow. **Three quick knocks**, then a sliding scrape like something dragging itself along the outside to keep pace.

At the grille, Sable doesn’t argue.

“Understood,” he whispers. You hear him shift position, metal clicking as he braces. The nozzle reappears between slats, but angling “behind you” is awkward; he can’t see the duct interior, only aim by sound.

“Two seconds,” he says—then he fires.

The jet catches the duct wall behind you and blooms forward, a harsh, dry fog that **chases your crawl**. It hits the cold filament’s approach point—there’s an immediate, violent reaction: a shriek of metal-on-metal as whatever was scraping **jerks away**.

But the fog also rolls over the engineer’s face and your hand. His inhale seizes. He tries to gasp—your palm stops the sound, but his body bucks, and his boot heel kicks a duct rib with a loud, accidental *clang*.

Sable goes dead silent. The nozzle withdraws. You hear the grille latch click fully shut. No more light.

The thing outside does not keep following the seam where the chill hit. Instead, it changes tactic: **a hard impact** lands on the duct two ribs ahead of you—like it moved around and struck from the side—followed by a rapid frost bloom that crawls toward the junction from *in front*, trying to cut you off.

You round the last stretch toward the junction and see it clearly now: the metal ahead is whitening fast, and a hairline seam at the junction collar is already crusting over, stiffening like a closing throat.

Threat is immediate: if the junction seam freezes shut, you and the engineer will be trapped in the cool branch with the filament on both sides.

I yank the engineer close and shove the wax vial into his hand, fingers crushing around his. “Crack it—smear the collar, now. Keep it *thick*.”  

Then I slam my shoulder and boot into the whitening junction ring in short, ugly bursts—trying to jar it before it locks—humming the psalm’s ending through clenched teeth to break whatever cadence is driving the freeze. “Move, move—through the moment it gives.”

*Agent reasoning: The junction is about to freeze shut; brute force is my only honest tool in a duct, and the psalm has already shown it can interfere with its rhythm. I’ll risk noise to get the collar open while I still can, and use wax/blood as a wedge and vibration-dampener.*

### Turn 133 [GAME]

The engineer fumbles the vial with numb fingers. The wax seal doesn’t “crack” cleanly—he has to worry it with his thumbnail until it flakes, then he smears the softened wax in frantic, uneven swaths around the junction collar. It goes on thick in places, thin in others; where it’s thick, the frost stalls and turns granular instead of glass-smooth.

You hit the whitening ring with shoulder and boot in short bursts. The first impact only numbs you. The second jars something deeper—metal answers metal with a hollow *gong* that vibrates up your teeth.

The third burst is when it goes wrong.

The ship’s delayed echo catches your rhythm. Your own impacts come back a fraction late, as if a second set of blows is landing *after* yours. Your inner ear loses the argument with the vibration. For two breaths the duct flips—up becomes sideways—your stomach lurches and your hands forget where “forward” is.

A phrase comes out of your mouth without permission, loud in the confined duct, shaped like a prayer but not in any liturgy you know. It rings off the plating.

The whispers answer immediately—soft, delighted—and the frost ahead of you stops creeping and instead **pulses**, as if listening for the next syllable.

The engineer freezes, eyes locked on you. His mouth forms a silent question. His hand smears wax again by reflex, but he’s shaking now.

Then you feel it: the cold filament that had been flanking you doesn’t strike. It **settles**—a broad pressure against the duct skin behind your calves, patient, like a body laying down to hear you better.

Your last shove does buy you something concrete: the junction ring gives a harsh, partial shift—just enough that the collar seam opens a finger-width before the frost tries to weld it again. The gap is there, *right now*, but narrowing.

Immediate threats:
- Your vertigo has stolen your orientation; if you keep moving fast, you risk blacking out in the duct.
- The involuntary phrase has “hooked” attention; the filament behind you is no longer searching—it’s listening, close.
- The junction gap is briefly passable but closing under frost pressure.

### Turn 134 [PLAYER]

I clamp my teeth into my own sleeve to strangle any stray syllable, then lock eyes with the engineer and jerk my chin at the gap—*now*—shoving him forward first with both hands on his shoulders. As he wriggles through, I smear the last of the wax thick across the narrowing edge with my bloody palm, then slide after him sideways, one arm hooked through his belt to keep my spinning head from drifting back toward the listening cold.

*Agent reasoning: The gap is closing and the thing is listening for more sound; I need to get us through without feeding it another phrase, even if I’m dizzy. Hand signals and physical guidance over speech, and I’ll sacrifice my own position if needed to keep the engineer moving.*

### Turn 135 [GAME]

Your teeth sink into fabric and skin; the sleeve tastes of old antiseptic and fresh iron. It works—no syllables escape, only a thin, animal breath through your nose.

The engineer understands the chin-jerk. He lunges for the gap, shoulders first. The collar bites his jacket and tries to hold him, frost grabbing cloth like teeth. He wriggles, hips twisting, boots kicking for leverage—one heel catches and scrapes loud.

You slap your bloody palm into the narrowing seam and smear wax hard, packing it into the gap’s edge like caulk. The thick wax doesn’t stop the freeze, but it *spoils* it—keeps it from sealing cleanly. The collar stutters, hesitates, and that hesitation is enough.

The engineer pops through into the next section with a breathless, muffled sob, half-relief, half-pain. He reaches back immediately, grabs your forearm, and yanks.

You slide sideways after him, belt-hooked, head spinning. For a second you’re certain you’re sliding “up” into nothing—then your elbow finds metal and you’re through.

Behind your boots, the junction collar clamps down with a hard, final **clack**. Your wax smear is caught in the seam; it doesn’t reopen, it just leaves a ragged, waxy gasket that prevents a perfect seal.

On the far side, the air is different: warmer by a few degrees and *stale*, carrying a faint burnt-copper tang beneath the maintenance dust. Your eyes adjust to a dim, amber service strip—this is the **warm branch service collar** you’d marked earlier, but closer now, tighter than memory.

The engineer presses his back to the duct wall, clutching the emptied vial like a relic. His lips are blue at the edges from the chill burst. He tries to speak, fails, then rasps: “What—what did you *say*?”

You don’t answer—can’t.

A new sound replaces the knocking: from the sealed junction behind you comes a slow, deliberate **scratching**, not searching now, but writing—tiny, repeated strokes in the metal as if etching a pattern. With each stroke, the duct skin trembles against your spine.

Threat, clear and present: whatever is on the other side can’t follow through the collar *yet*, but it is actively working the seam—either weakening it or preparing something to come through. The warm branch ahead is open, but narrow; if you hesitate here, you’ll be pinned between the collar and whatever’s waiting deeper in the warm run.

### Turn 136 [PLAYER]

I grab the engineer’s collar and pull him close, forehead almost to his. “You didn’t hear anything,” I whisper, flat and urgent. “If you try to remember it, you’ll give it a doorway.”

I point down the warm run and start crawling, forcing my breathing into a counted pattern, one hand dragging along the service strip to stay oriented. “Stay on my boots. No talking—nod or squeeze my ankle if you need me.”

*Agent reasoning: The scratching feels like it’s “learning” us; staying here invites it to breach. I’m dizzy and close to vocalizing again, so I need motion and grounding, and I need the engineer calm enough to stay quiet. I’ll redirect him forward and give a minimal truth without feeding the psalm.*

### Turn 137 [GAME]

He flinches when you haul him in, then stills—your forehead nearly touching his makes him stop trying to look past you toward the sealed collar. His eyes flick left-right like he’s checking for permission to panic.

“You didn’t hear anything.”

His throat works. He nods once, too fast. Then, as if the nod wasn’t enough, he clamps his lips between his teeth until they blanch. He lifts two fingers in a shaky oath gesture—then drops his hand as the duct trembles again.

From behind, the scratching at the junction seam accelerates for a few seconds—short, furious strokes—then abruptly stops. In the silence that follows, you can hear a faint *tick… tick… tick* like contracting metal cooling too quickly.

You turn and crawl into the warm run. The counted breathing helps; the spinning doesn’t vanish, but it becomes a manageable sway instead of a flip. Your hand drags along the amber service strip—warm to the touch, faintly tacky, as if it’s been handled too often.

The engineer falls in behind you, close enough that you feel his breath hit your boots. He does as told: no words. When he needs you, he squeezes your ankle once—hard—then releases, a single clear signal that he’s still with you.

Two duct-lengths in, the warm run narrows at a ribbed collar. The amber strip here is interrupted by a junction box bolted to the wall—its cover plate is slightly ajar, and a thin thread of incense-smoke is seeping *into* the duct from inside it, against the expected airflow.

As you pass it, the box clicks—one relay firing without being touched. The amber strip brightens a fraction, then dims back down.

Behind you, at the sealed junction, something answers that click with a heavy, distant **thud**—not at the seam, but deeper in the structure, as if the thing that was scratching has shifted its weight to another route.

Threat is now explicit: the sealed collar may be buying time, but whatever is listening is no longer committed to forcing that seam. It’s moving through the ship’s body to intersect the warm run ahead, and the junction box bleeding incense suggests you’re approaching a serviced space—one with openings big enough for more than sound.

### Turn 138 [PLAYER]

I stop just past the junction box and hook two fingers around the engineer’s boot to keep him close, then press my ear and cheek to the metal beside the ajar plate, listening for breath or movement on the other side. With my free hand I ease the cover open a hair—no jerks—trying to see where the incense is coming from, then glance back at him and tap my own ankle twice: *hold, stay silent*.

*Agent reasoning: The incense and relay click feel like the ship’s “liturgical circuitry” waking up—possibly a trap or a passage. I need to keep us silent, but I can’t ignore a serviced junction that might open into a larger space or give the thing a shortcut; I’ll investigate the box carefully while anchoring the engineer and preparing to retreat.*

I keep two fingers hooked around his boot and tap my own ankle twice: *hold*. Then I press my cheek to the metal by the ajar plate, listening, and ease the junction-box cover open the smallest amount possible to trace the incense—eyes searching for a vent, a wire-run, or anything moving on the other side.

*Agent reasoning: The incense leak and unsolicited relay click feel like a serviced cavity—possibly an access into a safer space, or a trap. I need intel without noise, and I can’t let the engineer speak or drift away.*

### Turn 142 [PLAYER]

I keep two fingers hooked around his boot and tap my own ankle twice—*hold*. Then I press my cheek to the metal beside the ajar plate, listening for any wet breath or relay-chatter, and ease the junction-box cover open a hair with my fingernails, peering in to trace the incense to its source—vent, wire-run, or something moving.

*Agent reasoning: The silence feels like the ship holding its breath; I need information without feeding it sound, and the incense leak could be a safer route—or a trap—so I’ll inspect with minimal disturbance and keep the engineer anchored and quiet.*

### Turn 143 [GAME]

Your double tap lands; the engineer freezes so hard the duct seems to gain a new brace. His boot muscles tense under your fingers, but he doesn’t pull away. He does not speak.

You put cheek and ear to the metal beside the ajar plate.

At first: only the warm-run’s low hum and your own blood. Then—relay-chatter, but not the crisp *click* you’d expect. It’s a soft, rapid **tktktk** like contacts fluttering under a load, followed by a single deeper **clonk** somewhere behind the panel, as if a latch is trying to seat and failing.

No wet breath. Something else: a faint, thin *whine* that rises and falls in a slow cycle, like a pressure differential being “played” rather than regulated.

You hook a fingernail under the cover and ease it open a hair.

Incense immediately thickens at the crack and threads across your knuckles *toward you*—wrong-way flow confirmed. Inside, your narrow view catches:

- A tight bundle of braided signal lines, their insulation frosted in beads despite the warm duct.
- A palm-sized service vent stub that should be capped; instead it’s fitted with a waxy diaphragm—a thin membrane that pulses inward-outward in time with the ship’s slow heartbeat.
- A relay block with one indicator LED that is not blinking but *breathing*—brightening as the diaphragm pulls, dimming as it relaxes.

As you watch, the diaphragm bulges outward once, too far, like something presses from the other side. The relay flutter you heard becomes audible—**tktktktk**—and the LED flares hard enough to throw a brief afterimage on your retina.

The engineer’s boot jerks in your grip despite himself. He clamps down, but you feel the tremor travel through the sole.

Then, from deeper in the ship—ahead, not behind—comes a heavy, structural **THUD** that repeats once, closer: **THUD… THUD.** Not scratching. Footfall-weight through ribs of metal.

The junction box answers on its own: the relay snaps fully this time, **CLACK**, and the wax membrane in the vent stub puckers open into a pinhole.

A whisper slips through that pinhole—dry, intimate, *right at your ear*—not a word you can translate, but a cadence you recognize from the pylon headphones: the “second voice,” the one that makes teeth ache.

Threat is now immediate and specific: that vent stub is an opening into a serviced space, and something on the other side is using pressure and relays to “listen” and to widen the membrane. The approaching thuds indicate it’s moving to intercept from ahead while the box tries to become a mouth.

### Turn 144 [PLAYER]

I slam my palm flat over the junction-box crack to smother the pinhole and shove the cover shut with my forearm, grinding it into place until the relay chatter dulls. Then I yank my sleeve into my mouth again, catch the engineer’s ankle in a hard squeeze—*move*—and start crawling fast down the warm run, keeping my head low and my thoughts quieter than my breath.

*Agent reasoning: That pinhole is a listening mouth; if it gets language, it gets purchase. I need to deny it sound and sight, and keep us moving before the intercept reaches this run.*

### Turn 145 [GAME]

Your palm smothers the crack. The pinhole’s whisper cuts off mid-cadence like a throat pinched shut.

You drive your forearm into the cover and grind—metal on metal, a protest squeal swallowed by the duct’s insulation. The relay inside flutters once in a panicked burst (**tktktktk**) and then dulls to a single, reluctant **tick… tick** as the cover seats. The wax membrane makes one last wet *suck* against the vent stub and goes still.

But the incense doesn’t stop. It thins for a breath—then resumes, now seeping from the seam around the cover instead of the pinhole. You didn’t end the flow; you just forced it to find another edge.

You pull your sleeve into your mouth. Fabric tastes like old antiseptic and copper. You squeeze the engineer’s ankle hard—*move*—and he moves immediately, scrambling forward on elbows and knees, boots kicking soft dents into the duct’s grit.

You both crawl fast down the warm run.

Behind you, the junction box answers your violence with a delayed reaction: a sharp **CLACK** from inside as if something re-routed. The seam you sealed *pops* once—tiny, not open, but enough to spit a bead of wax that skitters along the duct floor like a pale insect.

Ahead, the **THUD… THUD** becomes directional—closer, slightly left of your line, traveling through the ship’s ribs rather than the duct itself. Whatever is walking isn’t in your crawlspace yet; it’s paralleling you in the structure beyond.

Then the warm-run hum stutters. Lights in the duct—faint maintenance glow through grilles—dip for half a second.

The engineer hisses through his teeth, too quiet to be words, and accelerates until his boot nearly clips your shoulder.

A new sound joins the thuds: a slow, deliberate scrape like something heavy being dragged across a bulkhead—**shrrr… shrrr**—keeping pace with you on the other side of the metal.

You’re moving. You’re not yet caught. But something has your route bracketed: pressure-play behind, weight and scraping ahead-left, and the duct’s power just hiccuped as if the ship noticed you.

### Turn 146 [PLAYER]

I slow just enough to feel for a junction or grille with my fingertips, then press two quick squeezes to the engineer’s ankle—*left/right?*—and point ahead, palm down: *low, quiet*. If I find a service grille or side spur, I mouth into my sleeve, barely a breath: “On three, we drop out—no light, no words,” and start counting on my fingers as I scan for the nearest exit or branch.

*Agent reasoning: It’s pacing us outside the duct; the only advantage we have is silence and misdirection. I need a branch, a drop, or a way to mask our sound—otherwise it will cut us off ahead. Also the engineer is close to breaking; I should give him a simple, physical job.*

### Turn 147 [GAME]

You slow, palms and fingertips skating the duct’s seam-ridges.

Five handspans ahead your fingers find a line of cold rivets and a shallow lip: a **service grille** set into the duct floor, wax-marked at two corners—someone’s been here recently. The metal around it is cooler than the warm run should allow, as if it vents into an unincensed pocket.

You squeeze the engineer’s ankle twice—*left/right?* He answers by twisting his boot toe and angling his knee: **right**, then taps once against the duct wall as if to say *but not far*. He keeps his head down, shoulders bunched, obeying your palm-down *low, quiet* without you needing to repeat it.

You mouth into your sleeve: “On three, we drop out—no light, no words.”

At “one,” you test the grille. It isn’t screwed; it’s **latched**—a spring catch. It gives a millimeter with a soft metallic *tink*.

At “two,” the scrape beyond the metal stops dead, like whatever was dragging itself has paused to listen. The **THUD** footfalls also halt for a single beat.

At “three,” you pull.

The grille drops inward—but not cleanly. A **strand of wax** like a ligament has been smeared across the frame and it stretches, resisting, making a quiet, obscene *rrrk* as it peels. The opening below is a vertical drop of about a meter into a narrow service void—black, with a faint blue console-glow far down the passage.

The engineer commits immediately, sliding feet-first through. His boot catches the wax strand; it snaps with a tiny *pop* that is louder than it should be in the hush.

Instantly, the ship answers.

From the warm-run behind you: the junction-box relay you forced shut earlier erupts into rapid chatter again—faint but unmistakable through the ductwork. From ahead-left, the scrape resumes, faster, now **coming toward the duct line**, and the thuds return—closer, heavier.

As you start to follow the engineer down, something impacts the duct wall near the grille—**a single, hard knock from the outside**, right beside your head. The metal dents inward a fraction, vibrating your teeth.

Whatever is out there has found the drop point. It’s not inside the duct yet—but it’s at arm’s reach through the bulkhead, and it’s testing the skin.

### Turn 148 [PLAYER]

I suck in a tight breath through my sleeve and drop feet-first through the opening after him, twisting my hips to clear fast. As soon as I land, I reach up and yank the grille back toward closed—hard—then press my palm to it like a seal and whisper, almost soundless, “Go. Right. Don’t look back.”

*Agent reasoning: That knock means it’s triangulated us; lingering in the duct is death. I need to get out fast, but I also want to slow it—shut the grille behind me, even if it costs noise. The engineer is already below; I won’t leave him alone in the dark.*

### Turn 149 [GAME]

You drop feet-first into the void. Your boots hit a grated service walkway with a sharp metallic ring you can’t quite smother. The air down here is thinner, colder, and almost free of incense—your lungs notice the absence like a missing limb.

The engineer is already moving right, hunched and fast, one hand skimming the wall for balance. He doesn’t answer, but he obeys.

You jump, grab the grille frame overhead, and haul it up toward closed. It slams into place—almost. The wax strand you tore snaps back like a tacky tendon and wedges in the corner. The grille sits a finger’s width ajar.

You press your palm to it anyway, trying to make your hand into a gasket.

Above your hand, something hits the duct skin again—this time not a knock but a **dragging press**, like knuckles—or a tool—scraping for purchase. The metal vibrates against your palm through the grille.

Then the wax at the corner warms under pressure. It doesn’t melt; it *softens* and begins to **creep**, slowly extruding through the gap. It touches the side of your thumb and adheres with immediate, intimate grip.

A whisper leaks through the finger-width opening—not loud, but perfectly placed, as if the gap is a mouth aimed at your ear. Your teeth ache in sympathetic pulses.

The engineer glances back once despite your order, just a reflex. His eyes catch the wax creeping over your thumb. He flinches hard and mouths, silent: *leave it.*

From farther right, down the service void, a panel light flickers and a voice—human, strained—calls once, low: “Hello? Who’s there?” It’s not the engineer. It’s ahead of him, around the bend.

So the choices tighten in your hands: your palm is holding a grille that won’t fully close, the wax has started to bond to you, something on the other side is actively worrying the duct wall at this exact spot, and there’s a living person (or something using a living voice) in the direction you just sent the engineer.

No alarms. No sirens. Just pressure, wax, and that single human call waiting in the dark.

### Turn 150 [PLAYER]

I peel my thumb away with a sharp twist, sacrificing skin if I have to, and smear the clinging wax onto the grille frame to break the bond. Then I hiss to the engineer, “Keep going—right—don’t stop,” and creep after him low, one hand on the wall, the other raised to my throat as I call back toward the voice, barely audible: “Quiet. Identify yourself. No names—just crew or not?”

*Agent reasoning: The wax is already bonding and the grille won’t seal; staying here makes me the anchor point for whatever’s pushing through. But a human voice ahead could be bait—or someone trapped. I’ll cut myself free, mark the risk, and approach the voice cautiously while keeping the engineer moving.*

### Turn 151 [GAME]

You twist your thumb hard and rip it free.

Skin gives before wax does. A thin crescent tears at the pad—hot, immediate pain—then a wet chill as the air hits it. You smear the clinging wax onto the grille frame with a rough wipe. It holds there, stringing into a tacky fillet along the corner; the gap narrows a fraction but doesn’t seal. Your blood beads and then thickens fast in the cold.

Above, the pressure on the duct skin changes. The dragging stops. In its place comes a careful, *testing* tap-tap at the exact corner you just smeared—like something confirming where you were attached. The metal vibrates faintly; whatever’s up there is not guessing anymore.

You hiss the engineer onward. He goes—half-crouched, fast, shoulders tight—making only the softest clatter of boot on grate. He doesn’t look back again.

You creep after him, one hand on the wall. The service void is narrow enough that your knuckles brush conduit clamps; the cold metal leaves a faint dampness on your skin.

You call back, barely audible: “Quiet. Identify yourself. No names—just crew or not?”

A beat. Then the voice answers from around the bend, still low, but closer than it should be given the distance: “Crew. Concord. Medic.” The cadence is wrong—too even, like it’s been practiced. “We’re trapped. Door sealed. Don’t—don’t bring lights.”

As it speaks, a panel two meters ahead on your right blinks once—blue to dark—like a blinked eye. The engineer slows despite your order, drawn by the bend and the promise of an ally.

Behind you, up at the grille, something finally finds leverage. A single, blunt **impact** dents the duct wall inward with a metallic *gong*, and dust sifts down through the gap you failed to close. The wax fillet you smeared **shivers**, then begins to pull *back upward*, as if being reeled from the other side.

Whatever is on the duct line has started opening your exit from above—quietly, methodically—and it knows you’re no longer attached to the wax.

The “Concord medic” ahead waits in the dark, insisting on no light, while the thing behind you works the grille like a patient hand on a latch.

### Turn 152 [PLAYER]

I grab the engineer’s sleeve hard and pull him down against the wall, shaking my head once—*no*—then I whisper, “It’s bait. Don’t answer.”

Keeping my back to the bend, I speak toward the voice, flat and quiet: “What color is triage tag for immediate? And what’s the first drug in Concord seizure protocol—no doses.” 

Then I edge to that blinking panel and press my bloodied thumb beside it like a crude ward, listening for the grille behind us while I feel for a manual override or a way to kill the light without making noise.

*Agent reasoning: The “medic” voice feels rehearsed and the blinking panel reads like the ship watching; I won’t let the engineer walk into a mouth while our only retreat is being reopened. I need to slow pursuit, create a barrier at the bend, and test the voice with something only real crew would answer—without giving my name.*

I clamp a hand on the engineer’s sleeve and drag him tight to the wall, shake my head once. “Bait. Don’t answer.”

Toward the bend, I keep my voice flat and low: “What color is triage tag for immediate? And what’s the first drug in Concord seizure protocol—no doses.”

I edge to the blinking panel and press my bloodied thumb beside it like a crude ward, then feel along its seam for a manual latch or kill-switch, trying to dead the light without a click—while I tilt my head back toward the grille, listening for metal giving way.

*Agent reasoning: The “medic” voice feels too rehearsed; testing with procedural questions is safer than approaching. The blinking panel could be a lure or a control point—I'd rather smother it and find a silent manual override while tracking the grille’s progress behind us.*

### Turn 155 [GAME]

Your grip on the engineer’s sleeve yanks him flush to the wall. He startles, then goes still, swallowing whatever impulse he had to call out. He keeps his eyes on the bend like it might sprout hands.

You ask your questions into the dark.

The reply comes after a beat, softer now, as if it had to lean closer to be heard: “Immediate is… red.” A pause that’s a fraction too long. “Seizure protocol—diazepam.”

The answers are *plausible*. The cadence still isn’t: no breath hitch, no irritation, no *human* impatience at being tested while “trapped.”

You slide to the blinking panel. It’s a narrow service access plate with a single status pip—blue when it sees motion, dark when it sleeps. Your bloodied thumb presses beside it; the metal drinks your heat. The blood smears and immediately begins to tack, as if the panel’s paint is slightly adhesive.

You feel along the seam. There’s a recessed manual catch—old, mechanical. You ease a fingernail into it and lift with slow pressure, trying to avoid the snap.

It doesn’t click.

It **sighs**.

The seam opens a millimeter on its own, like a mouth parting. Cold air exhales from inside the panel, and with it a thin thread of incense-sweetness that doesn’t belong down here. The blue pip goes dark—dead—without sound.

Your thumbprint, left in blood, *stays* warm a second too long. The warmth crawls along the smear in a branching pattern, like capillaries deciding where to grow.

Behind you, at the grille, metal finally yields with a drawn-out **tear**—not a crash, but a controlled rip. Something has peeled a corner back. You hear the scrape of material sliding through: not claws on metal, but **wax on steel**, intimate and sticky.

The engineer’s eyes widen. He points, trembling, at the floor near your boot: a droplet has fallen from above—wax-laced condensation—landing and spreading into a small, glossy oval. It quivers once, as if listening.

From the bend, the “medic” speaks again, closer than before and now with a faint overlay, like two voices sharing one throat: “Don’t bring lights, Doctor.”

It used your title. No one down here should know it.

I go ice-still, then lean into the engineer’s ear. “Hold your breath. Follow my hand. If you hear me sing—run.”

Without looking at the bend, I wet my torn thumb on my tongue and smear a quick cross of blood over the quivering wax oval by my boot, then slide my fingers into the panel seam and whisper into it—not a name, just a scrap of psalm in the cathedral-ship’s cadence—to *draw* attention here.

Then I pull the engineer with me to the right, moving low and fast along the wall, aiming for the next junction or hatch—no lights, no more words.

*Agent reasoning: It knows me—talking will only give it more shape. The panel feels like a throat; if it’s an access into the ship’s nerves, I can use it to misdirect. We need distance and silence, not answers.*

### Turn 157 [GAME]

The engineer nods once, tight and frantic, and pinches his nostrils shut with two fingers like he’s done it before in smoke. He keeps his mouth closed, cheeks hollowing as he holds.

You wet your torn thumb. Salt stings the cut. You smear a quick, crooked cross through the glossy wax oval.

The wax reacts immediately: it *tightens* under the blood, drawing inward as if the smear is a stitch. The quiver stops. For one clean second it looks inert—then the surface dimples, forming a tiny concavity like an ear pressed into skin.

You hook your fingers into the panel seam and whisper the psalm-fragment—just cadence and shape, no name.

Inside the panel, something answers with a soft, wet **chime**, like a throat clearing in metal. The cold breath from the seam deepens; your whisper comes back to you a half-beat late, harmonized wrong, as if the ship is trying your voice on for size.

At the bend, the “medic” stops speaking.

Then it moves.

Footsteps—barely there—cross the grate toward the panel, not toward you. The sound is wrong: too many points of contact, like a person walking while dragging a second set of joints behind them. As it approaches, the air pressure shifts; your ears pop slightly.

Above, at the peeled grille, the wax-on-steel scrape accelerates, but also *reorients*—whatever was working the grille now tracks toward the panel’s position, drawn by what you fed it.

You pull the engineer right, low and fast. He follows by your hand, stumbling once when his boot hits a raised conduit strap; he catches himself without a curse, breath still held, eyes watering.

Ten meters down the right run, the wall breaks into a **wheel-lock hatch**—maintenance round, half-frosted, with a manual handwheel and a wax seal that’s been scored and re-scored by anxious fingers. It’s real, physical, and closed.

Behind you, at the panel, something exhales—audible now—and the blue status pip you killed flares **once** from inside the seam, shining through like a thin line of bioluminescence. The “medic” voice speaks into the panel, not into the corridor:

“Sing.”

And the grille behind you gives one final, decisive **pop** as a corner comes free. Something drops—light, sticky—onto the deck where you were standing, and begins to *slide* after you without footsteps.

### Turn 158 [PLAYER]

I clamp both hands on the wheel-lock hatch and start turning—slow at first, then harder—mouthing to the engineer, “Now,” so he helps without breathing. As the sticky slide closes in, I let out a thin, off-key thread of the cathedral psalm—not full song, just enough to lure it back toward the panel—while I keep my body between it and him. “Through the moment it cracks,” I whisper, and shove my shoulder into the hatch as soon as the seal gives.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is our only hard barrier; singing is a trap but my psalm-cadence can also misdirect. I need the engineer alive, and I’d rather risk my voice than let that wax reach him.*

### Turn 160 [PLAYER]

I clamp both hands on the wheel-lock and start turning—slow, then brutal—mouthing at the engineer, “Now,” so he throws his weight in beside me without taking a breath. As the sticky slide nears, I leak a thin, off-key thread of cathedral psalm—barely a lure, not a hymn—angling it back toward the panel while I keep my body between it and him. “Through the moment it cracks,” I whisper, and the instant the seal gives I slam my shoulder into the hatch and shove it open enough to spill us through.

*Agent reasoning: The wax-thing is sliding in fast and the “medic” is trying to make me sing; the hatch is our only hard barrier, so I’ll force it open while using the smallest psalm-thread to pull the pursuit back toward the panel, keeping myself between it and the engineer.*

### Turn 161 [GAME]

The wheel fights you like it’s packed with grit. You turn it a quarter, then another—metal groaning, frost shedding in brittle flakes. The engineer crowds in on your right, both hands on the spokes, jaw clenched, cheeks hollow from held breath. Together you wrench.

The wax seal on the hatch face doesn’t “break” so much as **unstick**—a wet, reluctant peel. A thin filament stretches from hatch to frame and snaps, spattering your sleeve with warmish droplets that cool instantly.

Your off-key psalm-thread leaves your throat like a leak. The corridor answers: the panel seam behind you gives a soft, pleased **chime**, and the sliding thing hesitates—its motion stuttering as if it’s deciding which sound to obey.

Then it commits.

The glossy smear on the deck *reverses direction* in a smooth, unnatural glide, drawn back toward the panel. As it moves, it leaves a faint wet track that steams for a second in the cold air.

But it doesn’t go alone.

From the peeled ceiling grille, something heavier drops—an irregular lump of wax and condensation with a hint of fabric caught inside it—and lands with a slap two meters behind you. It doesn’t slide. It **scrabbles**, making tiny suction pops as it gathers itself and starts coming your way in short, fast pulls.

The wheel-lock finally hits its stop with a hard **clunk**. The hatch releases a finger-width—enough for a knife of colder air to cut out, carrying the clean, dead smell of unincensed maintenance space.

You slam your shoulder in. The hatch swings inward grudgingly, then faster, and you and the engineer spill through into darkness lit only by a weak amber service strip. The engineer’s breath finally breaks—one sharp, involuntary inhale that sounds like pain.

Behind you, the scrabbling thing reaches the threshold just as the hatch moves. A strip of wax lashes out from it—fast as a thrown cord—and **sticks to the edge of the hatch**, trying to hold it open.

Your shove wins by inches. The hatch swings far enough to shear the wax-strip with a wet snap, and you kick the wheel with your heel as it starts to swing back toward closed.

On the other side, something bumps the hatch once—testing—then again, harder. The metal dents inward slightly with the second hit.

The engineer, eyes wide and watering, whispers hoarsely: “That wasn’t… that wasn’t a person.”

The wheel-lock hatch is mostly closed, but not yet dogged tight. Whatever is outside is now **actively pushing against it**.

### Turn 162 [PLAYER]

I grab the wheel with both hands and dog it shut hard, teeth clenched. “Help me—push on the spokes, don’t look at the dent,” I hiss to the engineer, then press my ear to the hatch a heartbeat, listening for breath or scraping as I scan the compartment for a secondary panel, vent, or crawlspace.

*Agent reasoning: If we don’t dog the wheel, it’ll force its way in; the engineer is panicking, so I need to give him something simple while I listen for what we’re dealing with and look for a second exit.*

### Turn 163 [GAME]

You and the engineer throw your weight onto the wheel together. The spokes bite your palms; the metal is so cold it feels briefly tacky, like it wants to take skin.

Outside, something hits the hatch again—**once**, then a dragging shove that tries to keep pressure on the seam. The wheel turns anyway, slow but inexorable, until the dogs seat with a final, ugly **thunk**. The hatch stops moving. The pressure from the other side keeps coming for another second, then slips, as if whatever’s out there lost purchase.

You press your ear to the metal.

No human breath. Instead: a faint, rhythmic **squeal**—wax on steel—circling the hatch’s perimeter, testing for gaps. Between squeals, a soft clicking like knuckles tapping in different places, not quite random.

The engineer keeps his face turned away from the dent, exactly as you told him. His eyes are shut tight. He whispers through clenched teeth, “It’s… *feeling* for the latch.”

You scan the unincensed compartment. It’s a squat service cell: bare ribs of conduit, a dead console with its cover missing, and a waist-high manifold wrapped in frost. On the left bulkhead is a **secondary service panel** with a simple lever-lock and a stamped label: **RETURN AIR / BYPASS**. Above it, a rectangular **vent throat** the size of your shoulders, its grille held by two quarter-turn fasteners—one already loosened, hanging at an angle like someone started to open it and stopped.

On the deck near the manifold sits a small maintenance case with a Choirwarden-style wax tally on it (three short burns, one long). Not yours. Not Concord issue.

Outside the hatch, the squeal stops. Silence for two beats.

Then, very gently, a voice you recognize as the “medic”—too calm, too close to the metal—speaks through the hatch as if into your inner ear: “Elara. Open.”

The engineer flinches at your name, eyes snapping open. “How the hell—”

Something presses flat against the hatch from the other side, and the dent bulges inward a fraction, as if a face is being applied to the metal to listen back.

### Turn 164 [PLAYER]

I flinch at my name but don’t answer; instead I grab the engineer by the collar and drag him under the vent. “No matter what it says—silent.”  
I snatch up the wax-tallied maintenance case, then flip the RETURN AIR / BYPASS lever-lock and throw it to BYPASS, listening for any shift in airflow; with my other hand I twist the remaining quarter-turn fastener and shove the vent grille up. “You first—crawl. Don’t stop.”

*Agent reasoning: The voice knowing my name is a lure; I need movement options. The vent throat is an escape route, and the return-air bypass might let me redirect pressure/scent/sound away from this hatch. The wax-tallied case could hold tools or a ward—worth grabbing fast.*

### Turn 165 [GAME]

You haul the engineer under the vent throat. He goes stiff at first—reflex to resist—then nods hard when you say *silent*, lips pressing into a thin line like he’s biting down on a scream.

You snatch the wax-tallied maintenance case. It’s heavier than it looks, and it’s warm at the handle, as if it’s been held recently.

At the RETURN AIR / BYPASS panel, the lever-lock gives with a sharp snap of spring metal. You throw it to **BYPASS**.

The compartment answers immediately: the amber strip-light flickers once, and the air changes direction with an audible **huff**—a low suction that pulls cold along the deck toward the vent throat. Frost on the manifold feathers outward, then collapses as airflow strips it.

On the other side of the hatch, the “medic” voice stops. In its place comes a thin, eager **inhalation**—too long, too steady—like something tasting the new current through microscopic seams.

You twist the remaining quarter-turn fastener. It’s already loose enough to turn with two fingers. The grille lifts, scraping metal on metal, and a spill of colder, cleaner air pours down from the duct.

The engineer climbs first, elbows and knees, boots scraping as he wedges himself into the shoulder-width throat. He looks back once—eyes wet, jaw trembling—and you catch him forcing himself not to speak. Then he crawls, fast.

As his boots vanish, the hatch behind you **ticks**—one of the dogs shifting under pressure. Not opening, but being *tested*. A soft wet sound follows, like wax being pressed into the wheel’s housing.

Then the voice returns, no longer pretending to be the medic. It’s layered—two tones slightly out of sync, one of them familiar in a way that makes your stomach drop.

“Elara,” it says again, gently. “You changed the breath. You always change the breath.”

The maintenance case in your hand gives a faint internal rattle—glass against glass—then a single, delicate **tap** from inside, as if something heard its name and answered.

The vent is open. The bypass is pulling. The hatch is being worked on from the other side—quietly, methodically.

### Turn 166 [PLAYER]

I swallow the spike of recognition and whisper back, barely breath: “Not yours.” Then I wedge the maintenance case against my chest, haul myself up into the vent after the engineer, and pull the grille down as far as it will sit—quietly—before crawling hard into the dark, following his boot-scrapes and the tug of the bypassed air.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch won’t hold forever and the voice is trying to hook me emotionally; I need to get into the duct with the engineer, but the warm case and the tapping could be a lure or a clue—bring it, but don’t open it here.*

### Turn 167 [GAME]

“Not yours,” you breathe—so small it’s more vibration than sound.

On the far side of the hatch, the layered voice goes utterly still, as if it’s listening to the shape of your refusal. Then, very softly, it answers with your own cadence stolen clean: “Not mine.”

You haul yourself into the vent with the case pinned to your chest. The duct bites at your shoulders; cold metal snags fabric. The bypass pull helps, a steady tug that makes your hair lift and your eyes water. Ahead, the engineer’s boots scrape fast—panic-contained, moving like someone who’s decided stopping is death.

You ease the grille down behind you. It doesn’t seat flush—one corner hangs a finger-width proud where the fastener was already loosened—but it settles enough to look closed at a glance. The scrape is quiet.

Two body-lengths into the dark, the maintenance case taps again from inside—one precise knock—then a faint, glassy clink as something shifts to follow the new orientation. The handle warms further against your wrist.

Behind the grille: a sound like a wet palm smoothing over metal. Then a thin, deliberate *click*—not the hatch this time, but the lever mechanism you threw to BYPASS being touched from the other side of the compartment.

The airflow changes.

It doesn’t stop, but it **stutters**, as if someone is pulsing the bypass to “taste” your movement. The duct’s pull becomes a series of gentle surges that catch at your clothes and make crawling uneven—push, drag, push.

The engineer reacts immediately: his boots scrape faster, then he slips on condensation and bangs a knee. He clamps his mouth shut hard enough you hear teeth click, and he keeps going.

From below, through the thin vent metal, the layered voice drifts after you—not loud, but perfectly placed, like it’s riding the duct resonance: “You brought it with you.”

A new sound joins it: a faint, rapid **scrabbling** on the underside of the duct, keeping pace for a moment—wax on vent skin—then falling behind as the airflow surges again.

You are in the vent, moving. The compartment below is no longer static; someone—or something—has hands on your bypass control, and something else is trying to track you along the duct from beneath.

“Keep crawling—steady. Don’t race the surges,” I whisper to the engineer, then tap back on the maintenance case in the same rhythm it tapped me, like a false reply. I wedge the case hard against the duct wall to make it clatter and scrape while I reach one hand down to feel for a damper latch or access seam—anything I can jam open—then shove forward on the next airflow pulse, trying to desync our movement from their “tasting.”

*Agent reasoning: The pulsing airflow is being used to track us; I need to break that feedback loop and keep the engineer from panicking. The case is suspicious and “alive,” so I’ll use it as a decoy/noise source and try to force a constant flow by jamming the duct or reaching a manual damper.*

### Turn 170 [PLAYER]

“Steady—don’t race the surges,” I murmur to the engineer, forcing my breath slow. I tap the maintenance case back in its exact rhythm, then grind it against the duct wall to make a messy clatter while my free hand feels along the seam for a damper latch—anything to jam open—and I shove forward only on the next pulse, trying to break whatever pattern it’s reading.

*Agent reasoning: The surging airflow feels like it’s being used to track us; I want to keep the engineer calm, mislead whatever’s listening with noise from the case, and physically sabotage the duct control so we can crawl on our own rhythm.*

### Turn 171 [GAME]

The engineer hears you. His pace changes immediately: the frantic boot-scrapes become measured—three pulls, pause, three pulls—matching your steadier breathing. He doesn’t look back, but he gives a tight thumbs-up without stopping.

You tap the case in the exact rhythm it tapped you.

For a half-second, the case answers—*tap*—perfectly aligned, like a duet.

Then it stops.

Not fading; stopping like a held breath. The warmth at the handle spikes, sharp and quick, and the case gives a small internal shudder, glass clicking once as if something inside shifted its weight.

You grind the case against the duct wall. The noise is satisfyingly ugly: metal rasp, a clatter that rings down the run. It does what you wanted—below you, the scrabbling sound hesitates, then darts to the side, as if whatever was tracking by vibration just lost its clean line.

Your free hand finds a seam: a narrow, riveted access strip running lengthwise. Half a meter ahead of your shoulder there’s a spring latch—industrial, meant for a tech’s gloved thumb. You hook it with two fingers and pull.

It opens.

A small damper iris inside flips from mostly-closed to yawning wide, and the duct **gulps** hard. The next airflow pulse becomes a sustained pull, strong enough to tug at your sleeve and drag loose dust past your face in a cold ribbon.

Consequence: the “tasting” pattern breaks—no more neat surges. But the price is immediate and physical.

The engineer, just ahead, is caught by the sudden sustained suction. His boots skid; his knee that he hit earlier slips again. He smacks his shoulder into the duct wall with a muffled grunt and nearly wedges sideways. He claws forward and manages not to block the run, but he’s slowed and breathing through his nose like it hurts.

Below the metal, something answers the change: a wet, deliberate *slap* against the duct underside, closer than before, followed by a dragging sound—wax or soft flesh being pulled along the seam you just opened.

And the layered voice shifts—no longer behind you, but *under* you, directly beneath the open damper, as if it found your new mouth in the airflow.

“You opened a throat,” it says, almost approving. “Now it can speak back.”

Through the open damper, you hear a new sound from somewhere off-run: a thin chorus-thread, not words, just a tonal rise—like a distant alarm that’s learning to be a hymn. The duct metal vibrates with it, and your teeth ache in sympathy.

You have created a strong, steady pull forward and broken the surging “read,” but you’ve also given whatever’s below a direct acoustic/air path to you—and it’s closing distance along the underside of the duct.

### Turn 172 [PLAYER]

I grab the engineer’s boot and shove hard to get him past the snag, then hiss, “Move—pain later.” As soon as he’s clear, I slap the damper latch back toward closed with my palm, and whisper down into it, low and venomous, “No choir. Not through me,” before crawling on, keeping the case tight and my ears pinned against the rising tone.

*Agent reasoning: I can’t let the engineer get stuck, and the open damper is now a conduit for the hymn/contagion; I’ll prioritize getting him moving and then choking off the “throat” even if it means losing the steady pull.*

### Turn 173 [GAME]

Your hand clamps the engineer’s boot heel and you shove with everything the duct gives you. He jolts forward, shoulder scraping loud, then he finds purchase—boots thumping twice—clearing the snag by a handspan. He gasps, “—Got it,” through clenched teeth, and keeps moving, no argument.

You slam your palm onto the latch to force it back.

It doesn’t swing cleanly. Something below is **pulling on it**—not strong enough to hold it open against you, but enough to make it feel elastic and wrong, like closing a jaw that’s biting back. You win the struggle in a short, ugly burst: the damper iris snaps toward shut with a metallic *clack* that rings in your wrist bones.

The sustained suction collapses back into smaller, uneven pulses.

For one breath, the tone you heard through the opening drops away, muffled—then it returns, fainter but still present, now traveling through the duct itself rather than the damper. The metal around you carries it like a tuning fork.

You whisper down anyway: “No choir. Not through me.”

From directly beneath the damper seam comes an immediate reply: not words—**a wet exhale** that fogs the underside of the duct, followed by a slow drag as whatever was there slides away… then a sharper, faster scrabble as it relocates.

A second later, the underside of the duct **bumps** once, hard, almost like a shoulder-check from below. Dust jumps. The maintenance case in your grip gives a startled internal clink.

Ahead, the engineer flinches at the impact and starts to speed up despite himself. You hear him whisper, rapid and scared, “What is that—what is that—” then he forces it down to a hiss as if afraid sound will feed it.

Behind you—faint, back the way you came—the grille you eased into place earlier gives a small, delayed *tick… tick… tick*, like someone testing the corner that didn’t seat flush.

Threat is now split: something is tracking **under** the duct and has started testing it physically, and something else is behind, working at the imperfectly closed grille. The airflow pulses continue, but they’re no longer “tasting” in a neat rhythm—they’re agitated, irregular, like the system is being played by hands rather than timers.

I hiss to the engineer, “It’s the ship listening—don’t name it,” then shove my hand forward to grip his ankle once, anchoring his pace. I wrench the maintenance case back behind me and jam it hard under a cross-brace in the duct, letting it clatter loudly, then scrape my nails along the metal as I crawl on—trying to leave the sound and the “tap” behind. “Don’t look back,” I whisper, and keep moving into the dark, counting my breaths against the hymn in the steel.

*Agent reasoning: I can’t let him panic and make noise, and I need to buy time by making the pursuer behind commit to the wrong path; sacrificing the case as a decoy hurts, but it’s better than letting it ride my ribs like a beacon.*

### Turn 175 [GAME]

“It’s the ship listening—don’t name it.”

The engineer’s breathing hitches at the word *ship*, but he obeys the real instruction: he stops forming questions. He nods once—jerky, unseen except in the way his shoulders tighten—and keeps crawling.

You catch his ankle, a brief clamp that forces his pace back into something you can match. He gives a quiet, pained exhale but doesn’t shake you off.

Then you wrench the wax-tallied maintenance case behind you and jam it under a cross-brace.

It goes in with a brutal, satisfying **clang**—and then a second sound you didn’t intend: the case’s latch pops half a notch with a brittle *tink*, like it resented being pinned. Something inside rattles and settles.

The duct answers immediately.

From below, the thing that had been dragging along the underside **reorients** toward the noise. You feel it in the metal before you hear it: a vibration that tightens to a point, then a wet, deliberate *slap-slap* as it moves under the brace. It doesn’t just follow the clatter—it commits to it.

Behind you, at the imperfectly seated grille, the testing *tick* stops. Replaced by a slow, careful **scrape**—someone (or something) now working with patience, not probing.

You scrape your nails along the metal as you crawl on. The sound is thin and ugly. It does what you wanted: it muddies your immediate acoustic “shape.” The hymn in the steel becomes harder to separate from your own noise.

But the ship doesn’t lose you entirely.

As you move into the darker run, the rising tone in the duct shifts pitch to match the cadence of your counted breaths—close enough to be coincidence, exact enough to feel like mockery.

Ahead, the engineer whispers without turning, “Case—” then bites the word off, as if naming it might invite it. He swallows and forces out, “We’re… leaving it?”

Another hard **bump** strikes the underside of the duct where you jammed the case, followed by the tortured squeal of metal under pressure. Not enough to tear through—yet—but enough to tell you the threat is now focused there, worrying at the brace like an animal at a trap.

You are moving forward, but you’ve traded one danger for two clear ones:
- **Below you**, something physical is now attacking the cross-brace and the pinned case, trying to get at the noise you left behind.
- **Behind you**, something patient is working the mis-seated grille, and it’s no longer “testing”—it’s opening.

I crawl up close behind him, palm between his shoulder blades to keep him from rushing, and sweep my fingers along the duct edges for the next access seam or junction—listening for a change in echo that means a drop shaft or grate. Without looking back, I add, quieter, “When we find a hatch, you go first. If it sings your name, don’t answer.”

*Agent reasoning: I can’t let him fixate on the case or slow down; we need distance and a safer exit point. I’m shaken by leaving it, but it’s bought us seconds—so I’ll harden my voice, keep him moving, and start hunting for the next access drop while the thing is distracted.*

### Turn 177 [GAME]

“We’re leaving it.”

The engineer’s shoulders twitch under your palm, a reflex to turn—he doesn’t. He swallows hard enough you hear it, then nods once. His hands keep moving in the crawl pattern like he’s reciting a drill.

“If you pray, do it silently.”

He exhales through his nose—almost a laugh, but it breaks into a tremor. He doesn’t speak again.

You press in close, guiding him by the center of his back so he doesn’t bolt. Your other hand sweeps the duct edges: rivet lines, seams, the occasional patch plate. You listen for the telltale change—hollow drop, a grille’s thin resonance, a junction’s wider throat.

Two meters on, your fingertips find an access seam: a narrow rectangular plate with a wax smear along one corner, as if someone sealed it in a hurry. When you tap it accidentally with your nail, the echo is wrong—deeper, with a vertical tail.

A drop shaft.

As you pass it, the metal around that plate carries the hymn differently: the tone you’ve been counting against *thins*, then returns a half-step higher, as if it climbed.

Behind you, the duct shudders—distant but distinct—followed by a snapping *ping* of stressed metal. The pinned maintenance case is being worried hard now. Whatever is under the duct is strong enough to deform the brace, and it’s staying with the decoy rather than chasing you—so far.

But the second threat keeps working.

From farther back, beyond where you left the case, comes a soft, steady sound like fabric dragged over mesh. Then: the unmistakable **click** of a grille corner giving way.

Not loud. Not sudden. Deliberate.

“When we find a hatch, you go first,” you tell him. “If it sings your name, don’t answer.”

The engineer finally whispers, barely audible: “It already did.” He doesn’t elaborate—just crawls faster for three strokes before your palm reins him in.

At the drop-shaft plate, the wax smear is fresh enough to dent under your fingertip. There’s a thumb-sized gap at the edge where you could lever it if you had space.

Then, from that plate—right beside your hand—comes a sound that isn’t air or metal: a human voice reduced to a near-perfect imitation, intimate and close, speaking the engineer’s name in his own cadence.

He freezes so hard the duct seems to freeze with him.

The threat is now clear and immediate: the drop shaft is “active,” and it can produce targeted voices. If he answers—or even reacts too loudly—it has a line on you both.

### Turn 178 [PLAYER]

I clamp my hand over the engineer’s mouth and press my forehead briefly to his shoulder, a hard, grounding contact—then I squeeze twice: *don’t answer*.  
In his ear I breathe, not words, just a slow exhale he can match, and with my other hand I hook a nail into the thumb-gap and peel the waxed plate up just enough to listen down the drop without speaking; if it’s clear, I shove the plate wider and point him through first, guiding him by the belt to keep him silent.

*Agent reasoning: The drop shaft is baiting him with his own name; the safest move is to break his freeze without letting him vocalize, and to avoid engaging the mimic. If we can silently redirect into the shaft, it may also sever the line from behind—but opening it could be a trap, so I’ll test and commit quickly, using touch signals and breath control.*

### Turn 179 [GAME]

Your palm seals the engineer’s mouth. He jerks once—pure panic—then your forehead hits his shoulder like a command and you squeeze twice.

He understands. His throat works under your hand, but he doesn’t answer the voice. He forces his breathing to match your slow exhale, shallow at first, then steadier.

You hook a nail into the thumb-gap and peel.

The wax doesn’t tear clean. It stretches in a stringy ribbon, resisting like warm resin, and the plate lifts with a reluctant squeal. Cold air spills up from the crack—air that smells *unincensed*, raw metal and stagnant condensation.

You hold your face close to the opening and listen down without speaking.

There is space below—vertical, maybe three meters—then a wider cavity. You can hear a faint drip and the distant, irregular pulse of fans. No immediate footsteps. No obvious machinery right under the hatch.

But the voice returns, now from *below* the plate, perfectly placed: the engineer’s name again, soft as a lover waking him. It isn’t a shout—it’s bait designed for exactly this distance.

The engineer’s eyes squeeze shut. He makes a small sound against your palm—almost a whimper. You feel his jaw try to move, then stop.

Behind you in the duct, something scrapes closer—light, careful contact on metal, not the heavy bumping from below earlier. This is different: **a crawler in the duct**, using hands or hooked tools, coming from the direction of the loosened grille. It’s still out of sight, but it’s near enough that the vibrations have a rhythm—pause, slide, pause—like it’s listening between movements.

You shove the plate wider. The wax tears with a quiet snap and the plate swings up enough to pass a body.

You point him through first and take his belt.

He starts to wriggle down, silent, obeying—then freezes halfway as the voice below shifts to something worse: not his name, but a clipped, official Concord cadence: “Engineer—status check. Respond.”

His training almost answers for him. You feel the reflex in his abdomen and ribs through the belt: a preparatory breath.

At the same moment, the crawler behind you stops moving entirely.

The threat is now immediate and specific:
- **Below the drop**, the ship (or something in it) is using *targeted voices*—personal and official—to trigger a response.
- **Behind you**, an unseen duct-crawler has closed in and is waiting for any sound or movement to locate you precisely.

### Turn 180 [PLAYER]

I clamp harder over his mouth and bite out a whisper into his ear, “Not Concord. Not your supervisor. Breathe—down,” then jab two fingers sharply into the nerve under his jaw to break the reflex and shove his hips through the opening by the belt. As soon as his boots clear, I let myself slide after him and yank the waxed plate down as I go, forcing it toward closed between us and the duct—no words, just a tight, furious exhale into the dark below.

*Agent reasoning: If he answers, we’re marked; if we hesitate, the crawler behind will strike. I need to override his reflex with touch and get him down fast, then deny the duct-crawler a target by closing the plate and dropping after him.*

### Turn 181 [GAME]

Your hand clamps down until the engineer’s lips blanch. Your whisper lands in the only place he can’t avoid it—bone and inner ear.

“Not Concord. Not your supervisor. Breathe—down.”

Two fingers spear under his jaw. His whole face tightens; the reflexive breath catches and collapses into a pained, involuntary swallow. It’s ugly, but it works: the automatic “reply” never forms.

You shove his hips through by the belt. He drops the last half-meter with a muffled thud and a sharp, contained gasp through his nose. He stays quiet.

You follow immediately, sliding down the shaft after him.

The cold is worse inside the drop: bare metal slick with condensation, no incense to soften it. Your boots scrape once on the wall—too loud in the confined tube—and you feel, rather than hear, the duct above go still in response.

As you descend, you yank the waxed plate toward closed.

It does not seat.

The wax you tore has bunched at the hinge edge, and the plate catches on it—stopping with a thin, metallic *tang* and leaving a finger-width slit open to the duct. You can force it lower, but you don’t have leverage mid-drop. The slit remains, a narrow listening wound.

You land beside the engineer in a cramped service cavity: a vertical maintenance well that opens into a shoulder-wide passage. The floor is gridded, wet, and cold enough that your soles briefly stick. A fan somewhere deeper turns with an uneven bearing, *whirr…tick…whirr*.

The engineer doubles over, one hand at his jaw, eyes wide and watering. He mouths soundlessly, then manages a whisper: “Thank you.” It comes out as breath, not voice.

Above you, through the slit, something moves.

Not a voice now—something physical. A thin, jointed shape crosses the gap, blocking the faint light for a heartbeat. You hear a delicate, deliberate tap-tap against the plate, as if testing the seal you failed to make. Then a sound like a fingernail dragged along metal, tracing the slit’s length.

The threat is clear: the duct-crawler is at the hatch, and the plate isn’t fully closed. It knows exactly where you dropped.

### Turn 182 [PLAYER]

I grab the engineer’s collar and drag him a step into the passage, then shove him behind me with a sharp look. “No sound,” I mouth more than speak.  

I jump, hook my fingers into the edge of the plate from below, and force it down hard—grinding the bunched wax with my thumb until it smears flat enough to seat—then I press my ear to the metal for one heartbeat, listening for the crawler’s position.  

Without waiting, I pull the engineer along the shoulder-wide passage toward the fan’s uneven *whirr…tick…whirr*, keeping my steps light on the wet grating.

*Agent reasoning: The slit is a beacon; I need it sealed now, even if it costs me skin, and I need the engineer moving before panic makes noise.*

### Turn 183 [GAME]

You haul the engineer one step into the passage and shove him behind you. He nods fast, jaw clenched, both hands up like he’s physically holding his own silence in place.

You jump and catch the plate’s lower edge. Your fingers slip once on condensation, then bite. You force it down hard.

The wax grinds under your thumb—warm, tacky—and finally smears flat enough that the plate drops into its frame with a solid **clack**. The sound is loud in the tight shaft.

For one heartbeat you press your ear to the metal.

On the other side: a pause, then a slow, careful repositioning—**scrape of something jointed**, and a faint, dry clicking like nails or hooks finding purchase. It’s directly above the hatch, centered. Then a soft tap-tap-tap that isn’t random: it’s mapping the edges, confirming the seal.

A thin vibration runs through the plate—pressure, testing. It doesn’t open, but you feel the insistence.

You don’t wait. You pull the engineer down the shoulder-wide passage toward the fan’s uneven *whirr…tick…whirr*. Your steps are light on the wet grating; the engineer’s are not at first—his boot slips, catches with a small metallic **skit**—and you feel him flinch behind you, terrified he’s just announced you.

Nothing shouts after you. No voice calls your names.

Instead, behind you, the sealed hatch receives a single, deliberate impact—**thunk**—followed by the sound of something sliding away, retreating upward into the ductwork. It’s not giving up. It’s repositioning.

Ahead, the passage bends around a rib of bulkhead plating. The air grows colder and cleaner, and the fan noise resolves into a nearer source: a service fan mounted behind a grille, its bearing failing on every third rotation. Beside it, a narrow side-door sits half-aj ar, with a painted warning in faded Concord stencil: **RETURN AIR / BYPASS**.

The threat now: whatever was in the duct is no longer at the hatch—you’ve bought seconds, not safety. It’s moving through the duct network to get ahead of you, and the fan/grille area is the next obvious point where it can listen and drop in.

### Turn 184 [PLAYER]

I pull the engineer into the shadow beside the half-open **RETURN AIR / BYPASS** door and press two fingers to my own lips, then to his—*quiet, now*. I ease the door open just enough for us to slip through, pausing to listen at the fan grille for any hitch that isn’t the bad bearing, any extra tap or breath on the other side. If it sounds clear, I guide him inside first by the sleeve, keeping my body between him and the grille as we enter.

*Agent reasoning: The fan/grille is an ambush point and the half-open bypass door is cover; I need silence and a quick plan, and I trust my ears more than speed.*

### Turn 185 [GAME]

You pull him into the thin shadow cast by the fan housing. He’s shaking, but he mirrors you—two fingers to his own lips, then clamps his mouth shut with his palm as if that helps.

You ease the **RETURN AIR / BYPASS** door open. The hinge complains anyway: a brief, wet **creak** like metal rubbing on old wax. You stop and listen at the fan grille.

The bearing’s rhythm is still there—*whirr…tick…whirr*—but underneath it you catch something that isn’t mechanical: a faint, intermittent **tapping** that doesn’t line up with the fan cycle. Three light contacts, a pause, then two. Like someone’s fingers testing spacing.

Then—very close to the grille—an exhale that fogs the metal from the other side. Not a human breath with warmth; it’s cold, dry, and too controlled, as if whatever is behind there doesn’t need air but knows you do.

The engineer’s eyes go huge. He clamps his jaw so hard you hear a tiny click.

You commit anyway, guiding him in first by the sleeve, keeping yourself between him and the grille.

Inside is a narrow bypass compartment: waist-high ducting, a service console with a dead screen, and a floor drain filmed with ice. The door shuts behind you with a soft **thud** you can’t fully dampen.

Immediately, the tapping at the fan grille changes location—sliding along the metal, left to right—tracking your entry. A second later, something **scrapes** along the outside of the compartment wall, not at the door but above it, as if it’s climbing to find an access seam.

The engineer crouches by instinct, hands over his mouth, and mouths: *“It’s here.”* No sound. His eyes keep flicking to you like he wants permission to run.

Then the fan grille bows inward a few millimeters—just a flex—followed by a careful, probing pressure at one corner. Something is testing whether it can peel it back quietly.

You are inside the bypass compartment with the door closed. The threat is at the fan grille and moving along the compartment’s outer seams, looking for a quiet way in.

### Turn 186 [PLAYER]

I grab the engineer’s sleeve and pull him close until his forehead nearly touches my shoulder, then mouth, *“Eyes on me. Breathe with me.”*  

I crouch to the iced floor drain and scrape a shard of ice free with my nail, then flick it hard across the compartment to clatter against the far ducting—one sharp, deliberate decoy—while my other hand feels along the console and wall for a manual access latch or service panel.  

Without speaking, I point the engineer to the lowest space behind the waist-high ducting and press him down into cover, then press my ear to the door seam, listening for whether the thing shifts toward the ice-sound or keeps worrying the fan grille.

*Agent reasoning: It’s hunting by sound and seams; if we can’t outrun it, we have to misdirect it. The fan and drain give me noise and a path—cold air, water, vibration—to bait it away while we slip out another route. I need the engineer calm and obedient, and I refuse to let it “sing” him into answering.*

### Turn 187 [GAME]

You pull the engineer in until his brow nearly touches your shoulder. He locks on to you like a drowning man finding a rope. He matches your inhale—ragged at first—then steadies, small, nasal, quiet. He nods once when you mouth *Eyes on me.*

You crouch to the floor drain. The ice film there is thick and cloudy; your nail worries at it until a shard breaks free with a brittle crack you feel in your fingertips. You flick it hard.

It skips once and **clatters** against the far ducting—sharp, bright, unmistakable in the tight compartment.

At the same moment your free hand searches the dead console and the wall seam. You find: a recessed **manual release ring** (painted yellow, half-scraped), and beside it a **service panel** held by two quarter-turn fasteners—both already slightly loosened, like someone opened it recently and didn’t fully reseat it.

The engineer drops where you point, folding himself behind the waist-high ducting. He presses his face to his forearm to smother any sound, eyes still on you.

You put your ear to the door seam.

Outside, the response is immediate—but not the one you wanted.

The pressure at the fan grille stops for half a second, then you hear a rapid, precise **skitter**—not toward the decoy clatter, but **away** from it, up and along the compartment’s outer skin. It’s as if the ice sound confirmed your location rather than distracted it.

Then a new sound: the faint, careful **turn** of metal on metal above the doorframe—someone working a latch or fastener from the other side, very gently, trying not to make the hinge creak again.

A thin line of colder air threads through the top seam of the door, carrying a smell like dry wax and ozone.

The threat is repositioning to enter from **above the door**, likely through an overhead access seam or panel, and it’s doing it quietly and fast. You have a manual release ring and a barely-secured service panel within arm’s reach.

### Turn 188 [PLAYER]

I flash two fingers at the engineer—*stay*—then I twist the quarter-turn fasteners and ease the service panel off without letting it clang, beckoning him up into the opening first. As he climbs, I hook the yellow manual release ring with two fingers, holding it taut and ready; I listen for the latch above the door to give, and if it does, I yank the ring hard to dump whatever it releases between us and the entry.

*Agent reasoning: It’s trying to come in from above the door; I need an exit that doesn’t force us past the grille. The loosened service panel is our fastest crawlspace, and the manual release ring can be a last-ditch trap/noisemaker if it breaches.*

### Turn 189 [GAME]

You twist the quarter-turn fasteners with slow, controlled pressure. They give with a muted **chit-chit** as the cams rotate. You keep a palm against the panel’s face and ease it free a millimeter at a time until it lifts away without ringing against the frame.

Behind it is a tight service void—dark, smelling of stale incense and cold metal—with a ladder-run of stamped footholds. Not a full crawlspace, but enough to get a body up and out of the compartment.

You beckon the engineer. He hesitates only long enough to look at the door seam, then climbs—hands shaking, boots searching for purchase. His heel scuffs once against the panel frame, a soft **tink** you can’t stop.

Above the doorframe, the careful metal turn you’d been hearing becomes a decisive **click**—a latch finally finding its release. The top seam of the door shifts outward a hair.

You yank the yellow manual release ring.

For an instant, nothing—then the compartment answers with violence: a bypass damper snaps open somewhere in the ductwork and the service fan surges, dumping a **hard, freezing blast** of return air into the room. It’s not smoke or foam—it's pressure and cold. Loose frost and dust explode off surfaces in a white sheet, slashing across the doorway and up toward the ceiling seam like a thrown curtain.

The thing above the door reacts: you hear a sharp, involuntary **scrape** as it loses purchase, followed by a rapid series of impacts—**tap-tap-THUNK**—as it’s slammed against the outer plating and driven sideways along the corridor skin by the sudden airflow.

But the blast hits you too. Your eyes water instantly; your breath stutters as the cold bites your throat. The door, already unseated at the top, is forced wider by the pressure differential—opening a wedge at the upper corner.

Through that widening gap, you see something pale and jointed flash past—too fast to count limbs—then a hooked shape catches the top edge for a fraction of a second before the airflow tears it away again.

The engineer, halfway into the service void, panics at the roar. He scrambles upward, faster now, nearly kicking your shoulder as he goes. He doesn’t speak—just makes a strangled, silent gasp.

The immediate outcome: your release bought you a moment by physically driving the intruder off the door seam, but it also forced the door partially open at the top and filled the compartment with a loud, obvious surge that will carry down the corridor. Whatever is out there is not gone—just displaced, and now it knows exactly where you are.

### Turn 190 [PLAYER]

I suck in a painful breath through my sleeve, then hiss a silent, urgent “Up—keep going,” shoving the engineer’s boot to the next foothold. I haul myself into the service void after him and, once my shoulders clear, reach back to pull the service panel up into place as a makeshift shield, bracing it with my forearm and knee while I listen for that skittering to circle back toward the opening.

*Agent reasoning: The door’s compromised and the noise will draw it back; the only safety is up in the service void. I need the engineer moving and then seal the panel behind us as quietly as I can, even if it’s sloppy.*

### Turn 191 [GAME]

Your breath through your sleeve comes in sharp and thin; it burns like inhaling winter metal. You shove the engineer’s boot up to the next stamped foothold. He obeys—clumsy but fast—scrambling higher into the void until his knees and hips disappear into the dark above, leaving only his boots and one trembling hand for a moment.

You haul yourself up after him. The edge of the opening bites your ribs as you lever your shoulders through. Your palms slip on condensation; you catch yourself on a seam and drag the rest of your weight into the service void.

As soon as you’re in, you reach back down and pull the service panel up like a shield. It’s heavier than it looked—thin alloy with a stiffening rib—cold enough to stick to your skin. You brace it with forearm and knee, angling it to cover the opening.

Below, the compartment is still full of swirling frost-dust, but the pressure surge is already decaying. The wedge of the door’s top corner remains slightly open; you can hear the corridor “breathing” through it.

You listen.

At first: nothing but the settling fan whine and the engineer’s muffled, frantic breathing above you.

Then the skitter returns—distinct now that you’re in the void and the sound transmits through the ship’s bones. It’s not coming straight back to the panel opening. It circles along the corridor plating outside, fast and low, like it’s testing for another route.

A second sound joins it: a soft, deliberate **knock** from directly on the other side of your makeshift shield—one contact, then another, as if something is tapping the panel to learn what it is.

The engineer freezes above you. You feel his body go rigid through the ladder-run; a tiny tremor travels down the metal.

The tapping stops.

In its place, a thin, careful **scrape** begins at the bottom edge of the opening—something trying to get purchase under the panel you’re bracing. The force is exploratory, not brute, but it’s steady and getting smarter: levering, pausing, levering again, feeling for the angle of your knee and the weak point of your grip.

You are concealed in the service void with the engineer above you. The intruder is at the opening, actively trying to pry your shielded panel away.

### Turn 192 [PLAYER]

I press my mouth to the seam above the panel and breathe a soft, broken phrase of the cathedral-psalm into the crack—just enough to carry, not enough to echo—then I shift my knee suddenly to *invite* the pry and snap the panel downward a handspan like a jaw.  

Without looking up, I reach back and pinch the engineer’s ankle hard—*move*—mouthing, “Up. Find an out.”  

As soon as the panel drops, I shove it back into place and start climbing after him, listening for the skitter to recoil or surge into the opening.

*Agent reasoning: I can’t outmuscle something patient and jointed; I need to redirect it and buy seconds. The void likely has another exit—if I can get the engineer moving while I use sound and the ship’s own hymn-whispers to unsettle it, we might slip away.*

### Turn 193 [GAME]

Your lips find the seam above the panel. You exhale the broken psalm-phrase—barely voiced, more breath than sound.

The metal answers anyway.

Not with words—with a change in the ship’s behavior: the void around you tightens cold, and the panel under your forearm vibrates as if something on the other side paused to *listen*. The scraping stops mid-stroke.

Then you shift your knee and *invite* the pry.

Whatever is under the edge takes it. The pressure rises—careful, confident—like a hooked tool levering up.

You snap the panel down a handspan.

It **bites**.

A wet, brittle crack pops through the seam, followed by a thin, high squeal that is not mechanical. Something pale withdraws so fast it rasps along the opening edge, leaving a smear like frost mixed with diluted blood across the panel’s underside.

Immediately, the skittering surges—not retreating. It moves from “searching” to “committing,” racing up the corridor skin toward your opening with a frantic, angry rhythm.

You pinch the engineer’s ankle hard. He jerks, almost loses a foothold, then scrambles upward on instinct. He doesn’t answer, but he *moves*, boots hammering the stamped holds.

You shove the panel back into place.

A heartbeat later, something slams into it from below—hard enough to jolt your knee and numb your forearm. The panel holds, but the edge lifts a fraction, and a hooked, jointed tip snakes into the gap, feeling blind.

You start climbing.

Behind you, the hook rakes at the opening, trying to widen it. You hear metal being scored—short, repeated **chirps** as it catches and slips. The panel is buying you seconds, not safety.

As you climb, a new sound threads through the service void: a soft, human exhale from somewhere that isn’t the engineer—close, just out of sight above the ladder-run. And then a quiet voice, controlled and clinical, speaking downward into the darkness:

“Elara. Don’t feed it unsanctioned syllables.”

A face is not visible yet, but you catch the glint of a Warden’s lens and the faint scent of antiseptic incense drifting down from above—someone is waiting at the top of this run while the thing below tries to force its way in.

I keep climbing, one rung at a time, eyes on the dark above. “Sable—then give me sanctioned words, or give me silence. Either way, open the hatch and get him out.”  

I glance down once at the gap and the probing hook, then call up more softly, “How many seconds before it learns the panel?” and shove the engineer’s boot again—up, up—toward her.

*Agent reasoning: Sable’s voice is both a lifeline and a threat—Wardens don’t “help” without taking something. I need her to secure the top while I get the engineer out, but I won’t let her control my tongue; I’ll bargain and keep moving before the thing pries in.*

### Turn 195 [GAME]

You climb, rung by rung, keeping your head angled up into the cramped dark. The engineer’s boots clatter above you; you shove one heel to the next foothold and he lurches higher, breath rasping.

Sable doesn’t answer immediately. You hear her shift position at the top—fabric whisper, a tool tapping metal. A narrow cone of light cuts down the ladder-run for a second, then snaps off again like she’s refusing to give the thing below a target.

“Sanctioned words,” she says at last, voice tight. “Breathe. Count. Don’t *sing* to it.”

Metal grinds above you: a wheel-lock being turned, not fully—just enough to test. Then she stops.

“I can’t open the hatch yet,” she adds, lower. “There’s a seal-mark on the outside. Synod wax. If I break it, the corridor reroutes and I lose you both.”

Below, the panel gives a short, ugly **snap**—a fastener finally shearing. The probing hook doesn’t just feel now; it *pulls*. The gap widens by a finger’s width, and you see a pale, jointed segment press into the opening, braced like a forearm.

Your question about seconds answers itself: it’s learning *as you speak*.

Sable’s light flickers on—one controlled blink—just long enough for you to see her silhouette crouched at the top of the run, one hand on the hatch wheel, the other holding a compact injector and a coil of filament line.

“Thirty,” she says. “Maybe less.”

She reaches down and loops the filament around the engineer’s wrist as he comes within arm’s length, yanking him the last half-meter upward with a sharp, efficient pull. He scrapes his shoulder on the sidewall and yelps into his sleeve.

At the bottom, the thing commits. The panel flexes inward, then *lifts* as the hook levers it. Cold air knifes up the ladder-run. You hear the creature’s movement change from skitter to climb—hard, rhythmic impacts on the metal like knuckles on rungs.

Sable braces at the hatch, still not opening it, and snaps, “Elara—faster. If it gets into the run, it doesn’t need the panel.”

The threat is now climbing toward you inside the same ladder-run, using the opening as an entry point.

I bare my teeth up into the dark. “Sable—break the Synod wax. Reroute it. I’d rather be lost than opened.”

I hook my boot under a rung and kick downward hard, then rip my sleeve and wrap it around my forearm as I reach down to jam cloth into the lower rungs—anything to snag joints and slow its grip—before I scramble up after the engineer, breathing, counting under my breath like she ordered.

*Agent reasoning: I can’t outrun it cleanly in a narrow ladder-run; I need Sable to risk the wax seal while I buy seconds by fouling the creature’s climb, even if it costs me skin.*

### Turn 198 [PLAYER]

I snarl up the ladder-run, “Sable—break the Synod wax. Reroute it. I’d rather be lost than opened.”

I hook my boot under a rung and kick downward hard, then tear my sleeve and twist the cloth around my forearm as I reach down to jam it between the lower rungs—anything to snag joints and slow its grip—before I scramble up after the engineer, breathing through my teeth and counting under my breath, “One. Two. Three.”

*Agent reasoning: Sable’s hesitation will get us killed; Elara would choose sacrilege over being taken. She’ll try to slow the climber with improvised snares while forcing herself into Sable’s “sanctioned” counting to keep the psalms from spilling out.*

### Turn 200 [PLAYER]

I snarl up the ladder-run, “Sable—break the Synod wax. Reroute it. I’d rather be lost than opened.”

I hook my boot under a rung and kick downward hard, then tear my sleeve and twist the cloth around my forearm as I jam it between the lower rungs to snag whatever’s climbing. I scramble up after the engineer, breathing through my teeth and counting, “One. Two. Three.”

*Agent reasoning: Sable’s hesitation will get us killed; I’m panicking but still thinking like a clinician—slow the climber, force a reroute, accept being “lost” over being breached.*

### Turn 201 [GAME]

Sable hesitates for one breath—then you hear her thumb a striker. Wax doesn’t *crack* so much as give up with a soft, obscene peel.

“Forgive me,” she says, not to you.

A sharp, sweet-smelling heat blooms at the top of the ladder-run as she drags the flame across the Synod seal. The wax liquefies and runs in thin threads down the hatch rim. The moment the last bridge of wax breaks, the ship answers: somewhere close, a door slams with cathedral-finality, and the ladder-run’s air pressure shifts—your ears pop hard.

The corridor above doesn’t open. It *moves*. Metal under Sable’s boots groans, and the hatch wheel judders in her hand like it’s suddenly connected to something alive and deciding.

Your kick lands. You feel the rung shudder through your boot, and you hear a wet, jointed impact below—something strikes the rung from the other side. It doesn’t yelp. It *repositions*. Then your torn sleeve goes down between rungs, wadded tight.

For two seconds it works: you feel the cloth catch, tugging as the climber’s grip snags. The ladder-run fills with a thin, high clicking—rapid, irritated, like teeth on glass. Then the cloth goes slack. Not pulled free—*cut*. A clean slice, as if the thing has a blade hidden where a finger should be.

A pale segment flashes in the dark below, then another. It’s climbing fast now, ignoring the rungs and using the sidewalls—four points of contact, insect-efficient.

Sable yanks the engineer up and away from the hatch lip and snaps the wheel hard anyway. The hatch finally gives—but not into the corridor you expected. It opens onto a narrow, triangular service throat washed in cold blue light, with no incense in it at all. You smell raw metal and old coolant.

“Wrong side,” Sable spits. “Synod reroute—now!”

She grabs your wrist and hauls you the last rungs. As you crest the hatch, you glimpse the ladder-run below: the thing is halfway up, a long, jointed body with a humanlike forearm shape that ends in a split, shearing tip. It launches upward in a single, violent surge—

—and the hatch begins to swing back on its own, closing like a jaw.

If you don’t clear the opening immediately, you’ll be caught in the closing hatch with the climber a few meters beneath you.

### Turn 202 [PLAYER]

I throw myself forward into the blue-lit throat, then twist back long enough to slam my boot into the hatch edge and shove it shut harder—anything to make it bite closed on empty air instead of my ribs. “Sable—pull him deeper, now!” I rasp, then scramble after them, counting through clenched teeth, “Four. Five. Six.”

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is closing like a trap and the climber is surging; I need to clear the opening now, but I also want to buy Sable and the engineer time by making myself the last through and obstructing the jaw.*

### Turn 203 [GAME]

You hit the blue-lit service throat shoulder-first and slide on cold metal, palms scraping across a film of condensation. Behind you, the hatch is already swinging—fast.

You twist and drive your boot into the hatch edge.

It bites shut with a clang that punches through your shin. The wheel-lock jerks once as if something on the other side rams it—then the seal catches. A thin seam of frost instantly webs across the hatch rim, locking metal to metal with a brittle, crackling sound.

For half a second, silence.

Then: *thunk… thunk… thunk*—measured impacts from the ladder-run side, not frantic. Testing. Feeling for give.

Sable doesn’t argue. She’s already got the Concord engineer by the collar and the belt harness, dragging him deeper into the triangular throat. He stumbles, boots skidding, and you hear his breath go ragged in the unincensed air.

“I can’t—my mask—” he starts.

“Breathe anyway,” Sable snaps, and shoves him forward. “Move.”

The blue light comes from a strip of exposed conduit running along the ceiling like a vein. It flickers as you pass under it, and each flicker leaves a faint afterimage of your hands on the walls—like the ship is remembering where you touched.

You scramble after them, counting “Four. Five. Six,” and the numbers come out too loud in the dead air.

Behind you, the impacts stop.

A new sound replaces them: a slow, dry scraping around the hatch seam, like a blade being drawn in a circle. Frost dust sifts from the rim in tiny bursts, drifting into the throat.

Sable glances back once, sees the frost crawling, and her face tightens. “It’s not trying to break in,” she says, voice low. “It’s trying to learn the latch.”

Ahead, the throat narrows and kinks left—past the bend, the blue light dies into darkness. The engineer is already half-limp with fear and thin air, but Sable keeps hauling him, forcing motion.

The hatch behind you holds—for now—but whatever is on the other side has stopped hitting it and started *working* on it.

### Turn 204 [PLAYER]

I grab the engineer’s wrist as we hit the bend, press two fingers hard to his pulse, and hiss, “Stay with me—match my count. Seven. Eight.” Then I glance back toward the hatch seam and whisper, almost a prayer, “Don’t teach it. Don’t teach it,” before tearing another strip of fabric and smearing it along the wall-conduit as we turn—marking our path in case the ship shifts again.

*Agent reasoning: The thing is learning the latch; we can’t afford a straight flight. I need to slow it with something it can’t “understand,” and keep the engineer conscious while Sable leads us through the rerouted guts.*

### Turn 205 [GAME]

Your fingers find the engineer’s pulse—fast, thready, but present. His wrist is cold-sweat slick in your grip.

“Seven,” you hiss.

He tries to answer and only gets a rasp. His eyes lock on yours in the blue spill, wide and wet. Sable shoves his shoulder to keep him moving, but she lets you set the rhythm.

“Eight,” you insist.

This time he manages it: “E—eight.” The sound is ugly, but it’s speech. He’s still with you.

At the bend you glance back. The hatch seam is no longer just frosted; the frost has been *scored*, a thin ring carved around the wheel-lock like someone traced the mechanism by feel. A faint metallic squeal carries down the throat—deliberate, patient.

You whisper, “Don’t teach it. Don’t teach it,” and the words fog in the unincensed air, then vanish.

You tear another strip of fabric. The rip is loud in the narrow space. You smear it along the wall-conduit as you turn the kink—leaving a pale streak against the blue-lit vein.

The conduit reacts.

Not a spark—worse: the blue light flutters and *syncs* to your movement, pulsing twice in quick succession like a heartbeat answering your count. The fabric doesn’t just mark; it *wets* with condensation and clings, and where it touches the conduit’s casing, a faint line of warmer light threads under the metal as if your smear completed a circuit.

Sable’s head snaps toward the strip. “Elara—don’t—” she starts, but she’s too late. The throat ahead answers with a soft chime, and somewhere deeper in the dark, a relay clicks open.

The air changes: a thin wash of incense-less cold flows from ahead, carrying the smell of old coolant and something like burnt copper—your tongue tastes it immediately.

Behind you, at the hatch, the scraping stops.

A single *click* echoes through the throat, as if the thing on the other side just found the point that matters.

Sable grips the engineer harder and pulls him around the bend into the darkness. “Move,” she says, no longer snapping—now it’s urgent and flat. “Whatever you just did, you told the ship where we are.”

### Turn 206 [PLAYER]

“I know—my fault.” I snatch the smeared strip back off the conduit with shaking fingers, wad it tight in my fist, and keep the engineer moving by his wrist. “Nine. Ten—say it.”

I lean close to Sable as we push into the dark. “Where does this throat *actually* go—coolant bay, confessionals, anywhere we can seal? And what does the Synod wax reroute *wake up* when you break it?”

*Agent reasoning: I feel guilty for triggering the conduit and I’m terrified the ship is “tracking” us; I’ll try to undo my mistake, keep the engineer conscious with the count, and press Sable for a plan without losing momentum.*

### Turn 207 [GAME]

You peel the smeared strip off the conduit. It comes away with a thin, stubborn tack—like lifting a bandage. The blue vein-light stutters once, then steadies, but the warmer thread you “completed” doesn’t vanish immediately; it fades slowly under the casing, retreating deeper into the throat as if the ship is reluctantly letting go of a scent.

You wad the strip tight in your fist. The engineer’s wrist jerks when you tug him onward.

“Nine,” you say.

He swallows hard. “N-nine.”

“Ten.”

“Ten.” He gets it out, then coughs—dry, painful. No incense means no cushion; every breath is raw metal.

Sable leans in as you push into the darkness beyond the bend. Her hand finds the wall by habit, fingers skimming for seam-lines.

“Where does it go?” you ask.

She answers while moving, voice low so it won’t carry. “Service distribution. Return-air and coolant bypass share the same bones in this section. If we’re lucky, it drops into a maintenance case bay—there are manual shutters. If we’re not…” She exhales through her teeth. “It opens into a confessionary junction. Those don’t seal. They *listen*.”

“And the wax reroute?”

Sable’s jaw tightens. “Synod wax isn’t just ‘do not enter.’ It’s a bargain. A memory paid to the ship so the corridor behaves—so doors pick *their* people and keep out the rest.” She glances back into the black behind you, as if expecting the dark to have learned your outline. “When you break it, you cancel the bargain. The ship stops honoring the Synod’s routing… and something older takes over. The warding becomes a hunt.”

Ahead, a faint blue glow returns—not from a striplight, but from a small rectangular service plaque set into the wall. As you pass, the plaque wakes and displays a single line of text in Concord maintenance glyphs:

**RETURN AIR / BYPASS — MANUAL SHUTTERS (2)**

Then, beneath it, a second line scrolls in a different, stuttering font—one you’ve only seen in Elara’s translation margins:

**LOVERS AS ORGANS**

Behind you, far back at the hatch line, metal gives a soft, satisfied sound: not a bang—an *unlatch*. The wheel-lock you froze is being undone from the other side, one learned motion at a time.

### Turn 208 [PLAYER]

I force my eyes off the scrolling phrase and squeeze the engineer’s wrist. “Eleven. Twelve—say it. Don’t let it steal your breath.”  
To Sable, I murmur, “Find shutters—now. I’ll take the wheel if there is one.” As we move, I spit the wadded cloth strip into my palm and scrub it hard over the alien line on the plaque, smearing it blind as we pass.

*Agent reasoning: The plaque’s “LOVERS AS ORGANS” feels like the ship baiting my grief; I need to keep the engineer conscious and get us behind something that can actually seal—manual shutters—before the latch gives.*

### Turn 209 [GAME]

“Eleven,” you say, crushing his wrist just enough to keep him present.

“E-’leven,” he rasps, eyes squeezed shut.

“Twelve.”

“Twelve.” He gets it out, then his knees dip. Sable catches his harness strap and hauls him forward before he can fold.

You murmur to her, “Find shutters—now. I’ll take the wheel if there is one.”

Sable nods once and breaks ahead by half a step, palm sweeping the wall, searching for the physical—handles, seams, anything that isn’t hymnwork.

You spit into your palm, mash the wadded cloth against the plaque, and scrub hard over the alien line.

It smears—partially. The Concord glyphs haze under wet grime. The alien text doesn’t wipe like ink. It *fights* the motion: the characters stutter, then re-form a half-inch higher, as if the plaque is sliding the message away from your hand. Your scrubbing does, however, leave a greasy blind spot that interrupts the scroll.

For a heartbeat, the plaque goes dim.

Then it flares brighter—blue-white—and emits a short, sharp maintenance chirp that’s loud in the unincensed throat. Not an alarm siren, but unmistakably a “service attention” ping.

Sable swears under her breath. “You just woke the panel.”

A seam to the right of the plaque pops with a pressure equalization tick, and a narrow access door unlatches by a finger-width—enough to show darkness beyond and a glint of a handwheel inside.

At the same time, the air shifts behind you: a thin, cold draft pulls toward the direction of the hatch you came from, like the throat is inhaling.

From far back, metal speaks again—closer now. The learned unlatching isn’t finished, but whatever is working the wheel-lock has progressed. You hear the telltale *ratchet* of a mechanism being turned carefully, not forced.

The threat is clear: something intelligent is opening the hatch you sealed, and your scrubbing has just pinged a maintenance node—broadcasting your position down the service line.

Sable drags the engineer toward the cracked access door and barks, “Wheel. Now, Elara—either seal us in or seal *it* out.”
