      "content": "Night settles over **Larkspur Gate**, the eastern entrance to the **Old Necropolis**, where the curfew bells have just stopped and the last living visitors hurry out. Violet-dark fog clings to the stone path. The air tastes of wet paper and candle wax. Bone chimes on the gate shiver in the wind, each one striking a different note.\n\nYou stand just inside the arch, half-hidden behind a leaning angel marker, with your reliquary lamp hooded under your cloak. On your knee is a sheet of warded paper, and you write by touch as much as by sight—short lines, neat brackets, careful hashes. You compare the copied puddle-text to the ink that bled sideways into a crude margin-map: three circled mausoleums, one marked with a moth-wing sigil. You check the lamp’s wick-oil level like a ritual, then close your satchel before any wax-scent can carry.\n\nBootsteps scrape stone. A **Warden-Scribe** rounds the gatepost with a shuttered lantern and a slate badge of the **Candlelit Concord** pinned to his chest; his glove is stained with sealing wax. Behind him, a younger acolyte drags a canvas sack that clinks with confiscated lamps. The Warden stops a mourner ahead of you and says, flat and practiced, “Curfew inspection. Satchels open. Pages first.” The mourner’s journal is taken, thumbed, and dropped into the sack. The Warden’s eyes lift, catching the edge of your satchel strap, and his hand settles on the seal-stamp at his belt.\n\nAt the same time, a **Grave-Gild courier** slips through the bars of the gate like he belongs there: neat coat, gold-flecked gloves, and a mourning ribbon pinned too carefully. He doesn’t look at the Warden. He looks straight at you and extends a black envelope sealed with funerary gold. On the wax is a thumbprint you recognize from the monastery’s restricted stacks—someone who should be dead. The courier murmurs, “**Vigil-Auction. Lot Thirteen. Candle-authenticated.** They’re reading it aloud tonight.” He nods once toward the necropolis paths, where the stones ahead seem to repeat the same epitaph twice.\n\nThe Warden steps closer, lantern angled to your hands. The courier’s envelope waits, warm from his palm. Your lamp, your notes, and your name are all suddenly in reach of other people.",

At your question, he leans close enough that his breath smells faintly of clove and grave-dust.\n\n“Whose voice?” he repeats softly, as if tasting a forbidden word. “A *borrowed one*. They’ve hired a throat—someone who can read without *owning* the text. But the Atlas-leaf… it prefers the voice of the one who died with the thumbprint.” His gaze flicks to the seal, then away. “If that voice answers, the room goes very quiet.”\n\nThe Warden-Scribe steps in, putting himself between you and the gate’s shadow. “Inspecting,” he says, and the word is a verdict. He holds out his free hand—palm up—while his other thumb rests on the edge of his seal-stamp. “Pages. Any loose sheets. Any copied epitaphs. Any invitations.”\n\nBehind him, the younger acolyte shifts the canvas sack; glass clinks again—at least a dozen lamps already taken.\n\nThe courier straightens, suddenly all professional distance. He does not intervene. He simply tucks his hands behind his back and looks at the Warden as if you’ve become a transaction concluded.\n\nThe Warden’s lantern tilts downward and catches the edge of the paper under your knee—a pale corner, too clean against wet stone. He sees it. His eyes sharpen.\n\n“Stand,” he says, voice lower. “Move your knee.”\n\nThe immediate threat is plain: if you don’t, he’s close enough to grab your leg or stamp a sealing mark onto whatever you’re hiding; if you do, he’ll likely seize the warded sheet—and your satchel is already open, ready to be “found” wanting.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"Black envelope sealed with funerary gold (unopened)\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Larkspur Gate (Old Necropolis entrance)\"],\"npcs_add\":[\"Warden-Scribe Halven Rook (Candlelit Concord)\",\"Acolyte Senn (Candlelit Concord)\",\"Grave-Gild courier (unnamed)\"]}```",

Gold-seal up.\n\nHalven’s gaze goes straight to it. He doesn’t reach for it immediately. Instead, he lowers his lantern until the flame-light skims the seal and makes the thumbprint shine like an oil-slick. His jaw tightens.\n\n“A Vigil-Auction mark,” he says, and the word “auction” comes out like a charge.\n\nYou offer it with two fingers. Halven takes it, but not from your hand—he snatches it off the stone with a strip of waxed cloth from his sleeve, as if the seal might carry contagion. He turns it once, reads the edge-script, then looks past you to the Grave-Gild courier.\n\nThe courier’s polite mask holds. He gives a tiny bow that means *no names will be spoken here*.\n\nHalven’s seal-stamp comes out. He presses it against the envelope’s flap—hard enough to crease the paper—then speaks a short Concord phrase under his breath. The stamp leaves a pale, chalky sigil that *binds the flap shut* without breaking the gold wax.\n\n“Confiscated,” Halven says plainly. “Syndicate paper doesn’t leave my custody.”\n\nAcolyte Senn steps forward and opens the canvas sack. Halven drops the sealed envelope in. It lands among glass and metal with a dull clink.\n\nThen Halven lifts the lantern to your face. “Now,” he says, “the page you were kneeling on. You moved too carefully for an innocent mourner.”\n\nHis free hand grips your satchel strap near your shoulder and gives a testing tug—enough to pull you off balance if you resist, not enough to look like an arrest to anyone watching.\n\nThreat, clear and immediate: Halven is about to search you physically, and the warded sheet under your cloak will be found if he pats you down.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[\"Black envelope sealed with funerary gold (unopened)\"],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

Halven’s flame skates across the sheet and refuses to settle; the edges show a faint, milk-white filigree like dried salt. The air between you both pricks, as if a nettle-brush passed through it.\n\nAcolyte Senn flinches and yanks the confiscation sack back a step, glass clinking. The Grave-Gild courier’s eyes flick to the sheet and then away, as if he’s seen this trick used to hide uglier things.\n\nHalven stops tugging the strap. He holds very still, lantern raised, seal-stamp poised but not advancing. Your warning lands: not fear, but calculation.\n\n“By the book,” he repeats, and there’s a thin edge of irritation. “You’re quoting Concord procedure like you’ve worn our wick-smoke.”\n\nHe does not touch the sheet with his bare hand. Instead, he takes the same waxed cloth he used on the envelope and lays it over his fingers, then reaches—slowly—to pinch the top corner of your “shield.”\n\nThe cloth smokes faintly where it contacts the warding. Halven’s eyes tighten; he feels it through the fabric.\n\n“Cute,” he says. “Blank wards are for transport, not for posturing.”\n\nThen he changes tactics. He doesn’t try to grab you. He angles his lantern down and to the side, casting light past the sheet to your cloak and thigh—searching for the *shadow* of what you’re still hiding. Senn, taking the cue, steps around to your left to get a second angle.\n\nThe threat becomes immediate and specific: they’re setting up a two-sided inspection to spot the concealed sheet under your cloak without laying a hand on you, and if either sees the outline, Halven can lawfully detain you for “concealment during curfew inspection.”",

Halven’s pupils pinch. He lifts his lantern higher, instinctively trying to dominate your guttering glow.\n\nYou step in—close enough that Halven has to either retreat or look like he’s being crowded. Your cloak sways with the movement. Your heel hooks, and the hidden warded sheet slides down, down—then catches.\n\nIt doesn’t go neatly into your boot.

The warding bites back: the cloth smokes again, and Halven’s stamp-hand twitches as if stung.\n\n“Concealment,” he says, voice snapping into official cadence. “Curfew inspection. Concord custody.”\n\nSenn moves to your other side and produces a thin cord marked with tiny candle-sigils—ready to loop it around your wrists if Halven gives the nod.\n\nYour question lands anyway. Halven’s mouth tightens, and for the first time he looks genuinely wary of your lamp.\n\n“I didn’t break the seal,” he says, low, “because I don’t let Syndicate words *choose a reader* under my light. That’s how they plant hauntings in honest throats.”\n\nThe Grave-Gild courier finally speaks, mild as a eulogy. “Warden Rook. Please. She’s making a scene.”\n\nHalven doesn’t look at him.

Your softer question hooks him harder than the lamp did.\n\n“A sealed letter came through Larkspur Gate last month,” Halven says. “Funerary gold. Concord-safe on the outside. Inside was a single line—just one—meant for a clerk named Iver.”\n\nHis stamp-hand flexes once, involuntarily.\n\n“Iver read it under lanternlight. He laughed—like he’d remembered a joke from childhood. Then his mouth started writing it again. On his own teeth.” Halven’s voice stays level, but his throat works. “We held him down. The words kept trying to finish themselves on anyone who looked too closely. Three acolytes went blind for a week. One still won’t open his mouth in chapel.”\n\nHe taps the cloth pinned to your boot-corner. “So no. I don’t break seals that want to be read.”\n\nAs he speaks, the air near the gate grows subtly attentive—thin, hungry. Not visible yet, but you feel it: the way lamplight earlier had *called* to something. If this drags on, whatever drifts near curfew inspections will notice the warding and come closer.\n\nImmediate threat: you’re being allowed to extract the hidden sheet, but if you hesitate or it tears, Halven will declare it a hostile ward and Senn will bind you on the spot.",

The moment it clears your boot, the warding wakes like a held breath: the inked margin-map on it darkens a shade, and the air around its edges feels slightly colder, as if the sheet is insisting on its own boundaries.\n\nHalven doesn’t reach with bare fingers. He keeps the waxed cloth between himself and the paper and answers immediately, clipped: “Stone. Flat. Don’t let it kiss my lantern.”\n\nSenn shifts to your left to block any line-of-sight from the gate road, cord still looped in his hand but lowered. The Grave‑Gild courier takes one careful step back, eyes fixed on the sheet like it might suddenly read him.\n\nYou lay the paper on the damp stone path. Moisture beads around it but doesn’t soak in; the warding sheds the wet like oil. Halven lowers his cloth-covered palm and pins one corner—firm, controlled—then slides the cloth under the edge with the practiced motion of someone who’s confiscated dangerous pages before. He does *not* lift it fully yet. He tests it, as if listening for a reaction.\n\nNothing screams. No flare of light. Just a faint, dry whisper—like turning a page in an empty room.\n\nHalven nods once. “Good. That’s a map-ward. Not a letter-ward.”\n\nThen, from beyond Larkspur Gate, a sound threads in: the soft scrape of something moving over carved names—like fingernails over epitaphs. It’s distant, but it’s coming closer, drawn not by your lamp now, but by the *exposed warding* on the stone.\n\nSenn hears it too. His head snaps toward the gate, and he murmurs, “Warden… something’s paging.”\n\nHalven’s eyes stay on the sheet as his posture tightens. “We’re done lingering,” he says, and finally lifts the paper—still through the cloth—bringing it up to chest height, away from the ground.\n\nThreat, clear and present: an epitaph-spirit (or several) is approaching the gate, attracted by the warded page being out in the open. If it reaches you before this ends, it will try to “read” whatever it can—paper, breath, or skin.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[\"Warded sheet with map-margin (partly pinned at boot; not secured)\"],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

It doesn’t stop—just becomes uncertain, circling.\n\nYou step up to the gate stones, still on the city side. The threshold’s old ward-line—salt and candle soot ground into the mortar—prickles faintly in your teeth as you near it.\n\nSenn blinks at your request, then fumbles at his belt pouch. “Grave-salt, yes—name-iron, no.” He pours a pinch into his palm and holds it out without stepping past Halven. The salt is gray, gritty, and threaded with tiny black flecks like peppered ash.\n\nAs you take it, the courier shifts—one foot edging sideways, measuring distance to the road. Halven’s head snaps up. “Don’t,” he says, and the lantern’s light hardens on the courier’s chest like a bar.\n\nYou lower your voice. Halven answers yours without looking away from the gate.\n\n“Who taught me?” He taps two fingers against the lantern’s rim. “Restricted stacks. Before the Concord decided certain lessons were ‘unhealthy.’ A dead mentor, if you want poetry.”\n\nAt “dead,” the courier’s throat works. He keeps his hands visible, but his eyes flick to the invitation seal at his own belt like it’s burning.\n\n“And Lot Thirteen?” Halven’s mouth tightens. “An ‘Atlas-leaf,’ they say. Authenticated by candlelight.” He gives the courier a hard glance. “Which is a polite way of saying: *they want a page that reacts to a particular flame.*”\n\nThe courier finally speaks, voice thin. “It’s not— it’s just paper. The Syndicate wants buyers who can pay for quiet.”\n\nFrom the necropolis side, the scraping becomes clearer again—now joined by a wet inhaling sound, like someone trying to breathe through soil. A pale shape drifts between headstones inside the gate: a loose column of cemetery mist threaded with faint letterforms. It pauses at the ward-line, then leans, as if sniffing for the “call” you just muffled.\n\nYou have grave-salt in hand, a spirit testing the threshold, and Halven carrying your warded sheet wrapped against his lantern.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"Pinch of grave-salt\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

The pale mist-column at the threshold leans in—then stops short as if it’s met a pane of glass. Letterforms in its body shiver and try to align into words, but the hush-ring keeps them from “catching” in the air.\n\nYour murmur draws it anyway. The mist compresses, tightens, and a voice comes through like damp paper forced to speak:\n\n“Q—Quill… whisper…” It mispronounces, tasting the syllables. “LAMP… BACKPLATE… CLOTH… WRONG.”\n\nIt isn’t sniffing for a *tomb* name. It’s sniffing for *yours*—and for the warded sheet Halven wrapped away.\n\nBehind you, Halven shifts his stance to put himself between the gate and you, lantern angled low. “Moth,” he says quietly, using the monastery-name like a warning. “It’s keyed to you.”\n\nAt your sharp look and command, the courier’s hands freeze mid-hover near his belt.

The Syndicate keeps a wick from there for ‘authentication.’ Lot Thirteen wants proof the leaf *answers* to that flame.”\n\nAs he says it, the invitation seal at his belt gives a tiny, involuntary *click*, like a locket snapping open by itself.

It can’t cross your hush-ring, but it stretches, thinning into a long, reaching tongue of fog threaded with script, probing for any gap in the ward-line.\n\nThreat is now specific: if the invitation seal opens fully, whatever is “bound” to that funerary gold will have a line to pull on—possibly enough to drag the spirit’s attention past the ward and onto you on the city side.",

The mist recoils a handspan, then surges back to the ward-line and tries again, more desperate.\n\n“NOT ROOK. NOT ROOK. THREAD-SCRIBE. STITCHED-MOUTH.”\n\nAs it says *stitched-mouth*, a line of script appears across the mist like a pulled seam—briefly forming the image you saw in the puddle: vellum-face, mouth sewn shut with hair-thin writing. The mist’s attention is fixed between you and the seal now, hunting a “line” to follow.\n\nThreat, clear and immediate: if Halven reopens the lantern too soon, the invitation seal is likely to open further—and whatever is bound to that funerary gold will have enough purchase to draw the epitaph-spirit’s reach around your hush-ring via the courier, turning the city-side threshold into a contested space.",

The second, tighter circle around the belt takes—salt grains skitter, then settle as if tugged into place by an unseen seam. For a moment, the funerary-gold wax quiets, its hairline flex arrested.\n\nHalven keeps his lantern choked, shoulders rigid. He doesn’t answer your warning with words—just a sharp nod, eyes fixed on the shutter like he’s listening for a heartbeat inside it.\n\nYou slide the warded sheet under the belt strap. The leather drags with a damp squeal. As you inch it a half-step farther from the gate, the air *catches*—a brief suction toward the necropolis side, like the ward-line noticing something moved. The belt crosses your new salt “island” boundary by a finger’s width… and the wax responds immediately: the seal creaks and lifts a fraction, as if trying to inhale.\n\nWhen you slap the fresh ward-slip over the buckle, the paper adheres with a soft, papery *click*. The wax’s flex stops mid-rise. A thin line of heat crawls across the ward-slip—ink on the paper darkens along a single stroke, writing itself into a tiny, involuntary dash, then going still.\n\nFrom the necropolis side, the tapping halts.\n\nA chain scrapes once, slow and deliberate, and a shape resolves just beyond the ward-line: not a full figure, but an arrangement of parts the mist is willing to outline. A hand first—bone-white, ink-stained fingertips—holding a length of fine chain with a brass nib tied to it like a pendulum. Behind it, a hooded head is suggested by drifting moth-ash; where a face should be, there’s only layered paper, edges fluttering.\n\nIt does not cross. It leans close enough that the ward-line bows inward like glass under pressure.\n\nThe thing answers your question by *demonstration*: the brass nib on the chain taps the stone—once, twice—and each tap leaves a brief, wet-black mark that immediately tries to become a letter. The ward-line rejects the writing; the marks smear into illegible hooks and evaporate.\n\nA voice follows, dry as a page turned too fast. “CALDRIS IS A MARGIN. I DO NOT STITCH MARGINS.”\n\nThe chain lifts. The nib points—not at you, but at the belt inside the salt island.\n\n“HIS LINE HIDES IN GOLD. LET ME READ IT.”\n\nBehind you, the courier chokes on a sound and goes very still, as if afraid even breath will count as permission.",

The “Reader” leans, and the stitched script across its mouth loosens by one thread, a single filament lifting into the air like a feeler.\n\nHalven Rook’s voice snaps tight behind you. “Lamp’s steady—no pulse.”\n\nThe courier obeys your order in the worst way: he goes perfectly still, but his gloved hand slowly opens, letting the gold-sealed invitation slip from his fingers. It lands near the ward-line with a soft *tck*—and the funerary wax thumbprint flashes, briefly wet-looking, as if freshly pressed.\n\nThe ward-line reacts to the gold mimicry on your decoy. A hairline crack of light runs along the buckle’s ward-slip—your own belt ward answering the gate’s ward like two notes finding harmony. The “Reader” takes advantage of the resonance: that lifted stitch-thread darts toward your decoy slip, aiming to *sew* itself into your drawn sigil.\n\nThreat, clear and immediate: if that thread anchors, it will “read” through your decoy—then use the resonance to bridge into the warding on your person.\n\nThe crawling gate-text adds one more line, faster, less controlled:\n\n**WHEN I FIND A MARGIN, I RESTORE THE MISSING LINE.**",

The “Reader” recoils as if you’d slapped its hand.\n\nYour boot scuffs through the outer salt circle on the belt. The hairline light along the ward-slip gutters and dies. Whatever harmony was building between gate-ward and buckle-ward breaks cleanly.\n\nWhen you nudge the gold-sealed invitation away with the edge of your warded sheet, the wax thumbprint doesn’t smear—but it *warms*. A faint scent of melted beeswax and grave-rose rises, and the paper under the seal curls slightly as if it’s been near flame.\n\n“Hands—up,” you order.\n\nThe courier’s hands rise, palms out. His sleeves fall back enough to show mourning-thread tattoos at the wrists: neat tally marks, some crossed through.

Then, lower: “But the ward-line’s rewriting.”\n\nBecause it is. Your soft questions don’t get spoken answers; they get *edits*.\n\nThe stitched face leans closer to the gate seam, and the black crawling text there rearranges itself, letters scuttling like beetles:\n\n**RESTORE: RETURN THE CUT NAME TO ITS ORIGINAL PLACE.  \nTHE PLACE IS OCCUPIED.  \nBINDING: CONCORD LAMPSKIN. WICK-OIL. VOW-THREAD.**\n\nAs that last line forms, the reliquary lamp in your hand doesn’t pulse—but its shutter seams sweat a thin line of warm oil-scent, unmistakably the Concord’s recipe. The “Reader” reacts immediately: the stitches over its mouth tighten, then one stitch unhooks itself and drops—an actual loop of script-thread falling from nothing to the wet stone.\n\nIt lands between you and the gate and begins to *crawl* toward your boot, seeking a new anchor now that the paper is denied.\n\nThreat: if that living stitch-thread touches your person or your lamp, it can fasten and “restore” by force—using you as the margin to write through.\n\nThe courier, hands still raised, finally speaks in a thin voice: “Lot Thirteen is… Atlas-leaf by candlelight.

It tries to flatten, to slip out from under the paper, but your weight and the warding hold it in place.\n\nHalven’s reply is immediate, controlled. “Lamp steady. No pulse.” He shifts his stance, putting himself between you and the open path behind—watching both the gate seam and the courier.\n\nThe courier swallows, hands still up. “Buying for… a table, not a person.

The seam-text—thin, hairline script packed into the stone’s join—shivers and tries to reflow around it.\n\nThen it *gives*.\n\nA strip of writing peels up from the seam as if lifted by an invisible knife. Beneath the false colophon, a truer line shows through—older, pressed deep into the granite:\n\n**“CATALOGUE OF OCCUPANTS: [VACANT]”**\n\nThe bracketed word isn’t ink. It’s an absence shaped like a word, a place where a name has been scraped out so thoroughly the stone looks *starved*. As you stare, the absence tugs at the back of your throat, trying to make you cough up a syllable you don’t mean to give. The seam answers your demand by *inviting you to fill it*.\n\nBehind you, the Grave-Gild courier flinches as the strip of seam-text lifts. He takes a half-step back, palm raised—an undertaker’s reflex when a corpse sits up. His gold-sealed invitation crinkles in his fist.\n\n“Ashen Bench,” he says quickly, voice low. “Two seats are spoken for: **Warden-Scribe Halven Rook**… and **Acolyte Senn**. Concord eyes. They’re coming to make it look lawful.”\n\nHe swallows, gaze flicking to your satchel like he can smell the ward-slip you just buried. “The empty seat—” His mouth works as if the word hurts. “—belongs to **the one the Concord expunged**. Not a person on paper anymore. It wants a name *put back where it was cut out*. It wants a hand to write it—yours, if you’re stupid enough.”\n\nAs he says that, the seam’s lifted strip trembles and begins to curl toward your inked finger, seeking contact like a hungry bookmark.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[\"Grave-Gild courier (unnamed) confirmed: knows Ashen Bench attendees; fears an expunged entity tied to Concord\"]}```",

It *stares back* as a hole in the sentence. Your throat tightens again, testing whether you’ll volunteer a syllable.\n\nHalven Rook is already there—close enough that his breath fogs faintly in the cold seep off the gate. He doesn’t look at the courier; he looks at your satchel and the ward-slip you just spent.\n\n“Spoken for?” he murmurs, and the words are careful, clipped. “I’m not bought. I’m **assigned**. Grave-Gild requested a ‘neutral witness’ for their Vigil-Auction and the Concord agreed—because the alternative is a riot of lamps and forged leaves.” His gaze flicks to the pinned strip. “You’re making that alternative.”\n\n“And Senn,” he says, quieter still, “is my acolyte. My runner. My liability.”\n\nThe courier’s eyes keep darting to the **[VACANT]** like it might climb out.

It takes names off stones, off ledgers, off throats. People forget who they are supposed to mourn, and the dead get… impatient.”\n\nAs he speaks, the seam around **[VACANT]** subtly widens—no more than a hair—but enough that the gate’s join sighs, and a faint, papery rasp leaks out from within, like pages being turned by someone with no hands.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[\"Warded paper (1 sheet)\"],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

The salt line beneath is not a full circle—more like a *stitched arc*, brushed in short, repeated strokes. Mixed in it are tiny dark grains that glitter when the lamp catches them.\n\nHalven exhales through his nose. “Concord salt, cut with lamp-ash. A ward-line. Old.”\n\nYour second tap on the hollower note answers differently now: not just hollow, but *metallic*, as if you struck a thin lid. You press the warmed ward-slip to the exposed salt—its ink shivers, then steadies, as though the warding recognizes the mixture.\n\nAt your dotted snag, the stone gives a faint, reluctant *give*. Not collapse—more like a cover shifting a hair. Something small is anchored there, close to the surface.\n\nThe courier crouches, squinting. “That’s not a name,” he murmurs. “Names don’t ring.”\n\nHalven finally says what he’s been avoiding. “The thorned L/I isn’t ‘Lot’ or ‘Ledger.’ It’s **Lacuna Imprimatur**—a redaction authority. Permission to make a hole where a record used to be.” He swallows. “And if this is Concord salt… then someone tried to *pin* the lacuna in place with iron.”\n\nAs he says “iron,” the lamp’s smoke pulls sideways again—toward your dotted spot—like it’s being breathed in.",

There, the salt has slumped inward as if something gently exhaled across it from *inside* the seam. A few crystals have gone dull and grey, like they’ve been licked clean of their sharpness.\n\nHalven Rook doesn’t answer immediately. His boots shift on stone—one half-step back, careful not to cross your arc. When he speaks, his voice is quieter than before.\n\n“We didn’t move,” he says. “The Loom did. A stitch was taken up somewhere nearby. That’s why it felt like a skip.”\n\nHe leans in just enough that his shadow touches the edge of your lamp-glow, but not the seam.\n\n“Lacuna Imprimatur,” he continues, clipped and precise, like reciting a rule he hates. “Signed by a Concord Warden-Scribe with a full seal-ring and a witness who can still be written into the ledger afterward. The price is always the same kind of thing: *a piece of record.* Usually a day you lived. Sometimes a name you answer to. Sometimes a witness’s memory of you. It doesn’t spill blood— it drains trace.

He swallows, then blurts the first thing he can, eyes locked on the seam and your salt.\n\n“Your lamp’s flame has two colors,” he says. “Gold at the core—violet at the edge. And the violet edge is bending toward the lid like it recognizes it.”\n\nAs he speaks, the seam answers: a thin, threadlike tick—*tick… tick*—not ringing metal, but script tapping bone.

Using the flat of your warded paper, you press the lid down. It resists for a heartbeat—something inside pushing up—then yields with a soft, reluctant *thunk* as the seal’s tension re-seats. Your warded sheet takes the contact without scorching; the ink on its margin crawls a millimeter sideways as if bracing.\n\nHalven answers fast, voice tight. “Fresh salt to re-state the boundary. Ash to confuse appetite. Iron only if you want it to *hurt* what’s inside—iron makes them angry.”\n\nYou dust the broken crescent with salt and soot.

Breath counts.

Halven flinches, then steadies his taper.\n\n“Good,” he mutters, voice tight. “Only on the start.”\n\nBut the null-sound has a consequence: the wax ridge you’ve just laid darkens in a thin line, as if a scorch-mark wrote itself across it. Not burned by flame—burned by *denial*. The ridge holds, yet you can see it turning brittle where the “unwritten” touched the Name-start.\n\nThe courier, still biting sleeve, makes a panicked, tiny inhale through his teeth. The seam answers at once—another hair-thin probe scrapes along the wax line, searching for the weak, darkened section.\n\nHalven swears under his breath and drips more wax to reinforce it. “If the courier breaks,” he says, “it’ll keep testing the wax until it finds a voice-gap. And if the wax goes brittle all the way through, it won’t need air—it’ll make a crack that *sounds* like a mouth.”\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

His breathing turns into a muffled, wet push into his own hands; his shoulders rise and fall in slow, counted beats. No voice escapes—just a faint skin-squeak as his fingers tick numbers.\n\nThat helps immediately: the seam stops “listening” for him. The probing along the wax ridge becomes less frantic, more methodical—like a quill testing paper instead of a mouth hunting air.\n\nHalven answers your murmur without lifting his eyes to the lid. “Yes. Don’t *deny* it—*drown* it.” He shifts his taper away from the ridge so he isn’t heating the brittle line. “Concord uses a low prayer-hum. No consonants. All breath and vowel. It muddies the first letter without striking it.”\n\nHe demonstrates once, almost inaudible: a steady, throat-deep *oooo* shaped through closed lips, more vibration than sound.\n\nYou pull your warded paper strip. The moment it clears your satchel, the ink-side-out fold catches a sliver of mothlight and the warding glyphs wake—thin lines on the paper rise like gooseflesh. The air near the seam tightens as if the paper has just become the most interesting “page” in the alley.\n\nYou press the band over the wax ridge like a splint. It adheres—at first.\n\nThen the seam reacts to the warding: a sharp internal scrape runs the length of the lid, and a hair-thin filament *hooks* the paper band from underneath. You feel it tug, trying to pull the strip into the seam the way a needle pulls thread.\n\nYou smear soot-salt paste along the edges. The salt bites—there’s a faint crackle, and the filament recoils, leaving a tiny tear in the paper where it snagged. The soot makes the paste tacky; it seals the band down, but unevenly. One corner puckers where the filament tested it.\n\nOutcome: the “splint” holds for now, and the seam can’t easily probe the wax line. Consequence: the warded paper has become a lure—epitaph-spirits nearby shift toward you. At the edge of lamplight, two pale, letter-streaked wisps detach from a headstone and begin drifting closer, slow but intent, drawn to the exposed warding like hungry readers.\n\nHalven keeps humming under his breath, steadying the lid with his shadow. “Keep that hum going,” he says, voice barely there. “If those spirits reach the paper, they’ll try to *finish* whatever it’s protecting.”\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}",

The two letter-wisps react like startled moths: they hesitate, their streaked bodies thinning, then drift sideways away from the brightest part of the beam.\n\nIt’s only half a herding. One wisp retreats toward its headstone and presses against the carved name there, dissolving into the letters like breath into stone.\n\nThe other does not go back. It skirts the edge of your light instead—clever, hungry—circling to keep the warded strip in sight. It’s closer now, a pale ribbon of punctuation with a faint face inside it, mouth a crease that keeps trying to open.\n\nYour lamp’s wider cast also catches something on the wall behind Halven: a pasted square of paper so thin it’s almost skin. For a blink, a pinhole in it gleams wetly—like an inked eyelid closing. Then it looks like nothing again.\n\nHalven answers your whisper without breaking his own low hum. “They bargain,” he breathes, “but not like people. They trade in *completion*. Give them a ‘safer text’ and they’ll still try to finish it—sometimes by finishing you.”\n\nHe glances at the warded splint, then at your lamp. “If you peel the ward-strip, the seam will test the gap the instant it feels air. It won’t explode, but it will *probe*—fast. Plain paper won’t stop it; it’ll just become something it can write through.”\n\nAs if to prove him right, the seam gives a short, hard push under your palm—one decisive buck—then settles again under the hum.

You feel the hook searching that weak spot, patient now.\n\nThe remaining letter-wisp completes its circle and starts drifting in, drawn to the puckered corner.

When it reaches the paper, it doesn’t “bite” so much as *overlay* itself—its punctuation-streak body flattening across the line.

The paper beneath your sole goes slick, ink seeping out at the edges.\n\nYou slide a warded sheet under the decoy. The moment the warded paper touches the ink-wet edge, the wisp reacts like a startled insect: its strokes jump sideways—off the decoy and onto your clean sheet—because the warding gives it a “surface that holds.”\n\nIn three quick, decisive lines, it finishes a crude route:\n\n- a moth-wing sigil,\n- three circled mausoleums,\n- and a narrow rectangle marked with stitch-marks like a doorframe.\n\nThen the wisp goes slack, the script paling to gray. It doesn’t vanish; it’s just…sated and dull, like an emptied pen.\n\nHalven obeys your tone. He brings the folded listening page closer without unfolding it, angling it so your lamp-light grazes the creases. In the fold-lines, a faint “ghost-route” shows—indentations like the memory of a diagram. You can make out the same three circles, but one is crossed out and rewritten, as if the route has been *edited* since it was first recorded.\n\nHalven whispers, “It’s not in this wall.” He nods at the crusted crack. “This seam was a listening point—like a keyhole. The stitched door is elsewhere. But—” he pauses as the wall answers with another dull *tap*, closer to the surface, testing the crust, “—something on the other side heard enough to start trying anyway.”\n\nAt the base of the crack, the soot-salt scab freckles—tiny pinpricks appearing as if pricked from within. A thin, dark dampness beads there, ink-black and slow, threatening to undermine your crust.\n\nAnd from somewhere down the necropolis path, you hear the crisp scrape of boots and the soft clink of page-seals: Warden-Scribes moving in pairs, sweeping the corridor.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"Warded sheet bearing a crude route (moth-wing sigil, three circled mausoleums, stitched-door mark)\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

In the margin, half-caught by the rub, there’s a thumbprint-shaped smudge of funerary gold dust—old, ground into the fold like it’s been handled at an auction table.\n\nHalven’s eyes flick to that gold smear. His jaw tightens. He doesn’t comment, but he folds the page closer to his chest like it’s suddenly heavier.\n\nYou scrape the slack wisp-film and soaked decoy into a wad and flick it to the crack’s base.

Fine.”\n\nYour warning about the stitching lands harder. The corridor behind them answers you: *tick tick*—then a third sound, a slow drag like thread being pulled through wet cloth. The air at the passage mouth cools abruptly, and the Warden’s lantern flame gutters to a thin, nervous tongue.\n\nBoth Wardens turn their heads toward the sound despite themselves.\n\nAcolyte Senn goes rigid. His eyes fix on the dark corridor, not your satchel. “It’s—” he starts, then swallows. “That crack was sealed with a concordance stitch. If it’s ticking, it means the seam is… being read.”\n\n“Being read by what?” the second Warden snaps, but his voice has lost some authority.\n\nSenn forces the words out, fast and ashamed. “An epitaph-spirit. A hungry one. It listens for lamplight and unfinished lines.”\n\nHalven doesn’t waste the opening. He steps half a pace forward—just enough to block the Wardens from pushing deeper into your little side passage—and points his lantern toward the corridor as if to take command of the problem. “You heard the acolyte,” he says. “If you want a spectacle, stand here and let it wake fully.”\n\nWhile their attention is dragged toward the corridor, you edge one step deeper between the leaning stones.\n\nYou get the concealment you wanted for a heartbeat—then your heel nudges something half-buried in moss: a small memorial bell on a hair-knot cord.

Up close it’s not a bell at all—no clapper, no hollow. It’s a little brass tab stamped with a name that’s been scratched off so hard the metal is furred with burrs. The cord smells faintly of old rosemary and scalp-oil.\n\nHalven’s eyes narrow at it. “Grave-tab,” he confirms, low. “A locator.

Your own reliquary lamp narrows to a slit—just enough to see stone texture and the wet shine of the seam.\n\nThe black thread hesitates midair as if it’s lost the scent.\n\nYou slide the blank warded sheet in front of it. The warding takes—faint, chalky lines on the paper wake like sleeping ink, forming a shallow “bite” along the rune-edge. When you pinch the thread to that edge, it catches with a tiny, resistant *tink*, like snagging a hook on cloth.\n\nThe moment you murmur “Read this instead,” the thread shivers and presses into the paper. Letters start to bruise up through the sheet from the point of contact—backwards at first, then trying to right themselves. It’s indexing the page.\n\nYou scrape with the charcoal stick.\n\nCharcoal is not a blade. It smears, grinds, and—worse—*writes*. The scrape leaves a thick black streak across the warded sheet, and the thread responds like a fish feeling a tug: it tightens, then *splits* into two finer hairs rather than snapping clean. One hair stays pinned in your bite-rune edge; the other whips free and darts back toward the seam.\n\nIt hits the crack and vanishes inside with a soft, hungry *sip*.\n\nThe seam immediately brightens with hair-thin script again, faster now, as if rewarded. Names try to assemble along the stone, stuttering: **ELD—** then crossed through by a wriggle of ink; **SENN** half-formed; **ROOK** briefly legible before it blurs.\n\nHalven flinches at his own name appearing, then forces his voice steady. “Yes,” he says, low. “We have a dummy epitaph. We call it the *Ashen Witness*. ‘Here lies ASHEN WITNESS, who saw and said nothing.’ We feed it to ledgers, to traps, to anything that bites names.”\n\nThe Warden who’d grabbed you swallows hard. He’s stopped trying to take the tab now; his hand hovers, unsure, watching the writing like it might leap.\n\nIn your pinch, the captured hair-thread continues to burrow into the warded sheet, trying to complete a line—its “ink” bleeding into the paper’s fibers. The bite-rune edge holds it, but you can feel the tension climbing: if you let go, it will either lash for the nearest living name again… or drag your sheet toward the seam.\n\nThe threat is immediate and specific: the seam is actively indexing you by name, and the remaining thread in your grip is still “reading” and may pull free if the warding slips.",

The sheet is trembling slightly from the tension in that strand.\n\n- **The seam’s behavior:** The crack in the stone is no longer “quiet.” It’s actively **brightening with hair-thin script**, like a sentence being written too fast to read.

You can clearly make out fragments as they flare and smear: **ELD—** (then struck through), **SENN** (half-formed), and **ROOK** (legible for a heartbeat before blurring). The seam is *indexing living names*—that’s the threat—and it’s doing it faster than before.\n\n- **Senn:** Senn is **one step behind and to your left**, shoulders hunched, hood snapped shut. He’s holding his hands up near his collar like he’s afraid to touch anything. He’s staring at the seam even though he can barely see it, listening to the scratch-sound of the script. He hasn’t spoken since the hood went down; his breathing is quick and shallow.\n\n- **Halven Rook:** Halven is **to your right**, closer than Senn—about an arm’s length away—half-turned so he can watch both you and the corridor behind. His lantern is also hooded. His jaw is tight; his eyes keep flicking to the momentary appearance of **ROOK** on the seam. He’s ready to grab you or the sheet if it jerks.\n\n- **The other Wardens / the cord:** The nearest Warden **has taken the grave-tab cord**—it’s looped around his gloved hand. He has *not* tied it off yet. He’s looking between Halven and the leaning stone you indicated, hesitating like he expects a command or a punishment for moving wrong. The second Warden is a pace behind him, watching the seam, blade-hand hovering near his belt seal.\n\n**Immediate danger, clearly:** the seam is actively trying to complete and “accept” a living name.

When you angle the reliquary lamp, the needle-flame throws a tight oval of light across the mausoleum’s face.\n\nThe scratching becomes visible in the lamplight as *movement in the stone’s dust*: fine grit shivers in a line, traveling rightward along a mortar seam. Where it passes, hairline script briefly lifts—pale, raised strokes like dried glue—then collapses back into plain stone. It’s not random. It’s *spelling while it searches*.\n\nSenn nods fast when you squeeze his shoulder—he can breathe. His eyes are wet and fixed on the seam like it’s a throat.\n\nHalven answers your question without taking his gaze off the wall. “An Ashen Witness buys you a substitute—an acceptable silence. It tells the claim there’s already a recorded absence, so it can stop hunting a living name.” His jaw tightens. “What it owes later is simple: testimony. Someday it will come to collect what the witness ‘saw and said nothing’ about. And it will try to make that true.”\n\nYou slide the second warded sheet edge-to-edge in the direction the scratching runs. The moment the paper overlaps the seam by a thumb’s width, the scratching *hits it*—hard enough that you feel the vibration through the sheet. A line of ink blooms under the paper like a bruise spreading in water, and for an instant letters try to emboss through from beneath, reversed as if read from inside a coffin.\n\nThen the warding bites. The ink stops at the sigils and begins to pool at the nearest unwarded edge—your overlap line—testing it like a tongue on a loose tooth.\n\nHalven shifts, bracing his shoulder against the mausoleum to keep the sheets from peeling. “It’s learning your seams,” he mutters. “Don’t give it gaps.”\n\nThe scratching abruptly detours *downward*, toward the base of the wall. Dust lifts in a narrow stream and skitters into a drainage crack between stones. The threat is clear: it’s trying to surface somewhere your paper can’t easily cover—below, where the wall meets the ground.\n\nFrom that crack, a thin exhale of cold air leaks out, smelling of wet vellum and old funerary gold.",

Like it’s listening for a new gap.” He shifts his weight minutely. “The wall’s cold again. That’s good.”\n\nYou crouch to Senn and offer the cloth.

One corner of the cradle drinks in a smear of black moisture. The warding holds, but the wet spot blooms into a faint halo of cramped, illegible micro-script—like the floor tried to annotate your paper and failed to find a grammar.\n\nSenn stays still. He breathes. On his next exhale, another filament of soot-script reaches down, touches the funnel, and again collapses into grit against the warding. The grit skitters, dry and pepper-fine, collecting in the fold like dead ash.\n\nHalven answers your first question with a hard look that says *don’t make me say it*—then he does, because you asked for exactness.\n\n“**OPEN. THE. LAMP.**” he whispers, each word clipped and forced through his teeth, careful not to project toward the seam. “It wrote it on wool. We burned the sleeve. The man lived. He never stopped smelling ink.”\n\nAt “lamp,” your reliquary flame gutters once—just a brief stutter, like someone pinched the wick from very far away—then steadies. Senn flinches at the flicker but keeps breathing.\n\nYou glance over your shoulder without moving your feet. Halven shifts his weight minutely and tests the patched seam with his forearm and shoulder.\n\n“Flat-cold,” he murmurs. “No bulge. No give. But—” He pauses, listening with his bones rather than his ears. “Pressure changes when it taps. Like it’s right there, then not.”\n\nFrom the seam comes a new sound: not tapping—*a slow drag*, as if a fingernail is tracing the edge of your patch. The patch itself doesn’t move, but the warded buffer sheet under Halven’s elbow darkens another shade along its margin, as though it’s being read.\n\nThreat, now immediate and specific: whatever is behind the stitched door has stopped testing for a reply and started *studying your warding and your lamp-word*. It may be trying to provoke you into opening the lamp, or to find a way to “write through” the paper stand you’ve placed on the damp stone.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[\"Warded sheet\",\"Warded sheet\"],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

It stops trying to “bloom.” The pepper-fine grit in the funnel stays inert.\n\nSenn keeps breathing. His nostrils flare less on each inhale. The soot at the edge of his right nostril thins from a visible smudge to a dull shadow, as if whatever’s inside him is losing purchase when it can’t find a friendly surface. He nods once, tiny, eyes locked on the flame like it’s a metronome.\n\nHalven’s jaw tightens at your warning. He doesn’t answer—just shifts his gaze away from your lamp, as if even looking at it feels like “thinking near” the bait.\n\nYou lay a blank sheet over the darkening buffer by his elbow. The effect is immediate and ugly: the darkening stops on the buffer beneath, but the new blank sheet starts to take it instead—its fibers drinking cold and turning gray along the edge closest to the seam. A faint indentation appears in the paper, as though invisible type is pressing from the other side. Not ink, not yet—pressure.\n\nThen you lean in, silent, and wash the patch in lamplight.\n\nThe stitches react.\n\nThree threads on the lower left of the patch twitch in sequence—one, two, three—like a patient finger-tap answered in thread. In the lamp’s wash you see the twitches aren’t random: they’re concentrated around a knot that wasn’t there a moment ago, a tiny puckered “eye” in the stitching that seems to drink the light rather than reflect it.\n\nAt the same time, the sacrificial blank sheet under Halven’s elbow creases by itself, forming a shallow fold that points directly at that knot—like an arrow made of paper memory.\n\nFrom behind the seam comes a sound you can’t mistake now: a muffled inhale, slow and close, as if someone is breathing against cloth. The patch stays flat-cold under Halven’s pressure, but the breathing continues—testing the boundary without bulging it.\n\nThreat, clear: the thing behind the stitched door has found a focal point (“the eye-knot”) where it can interact—reading by pressure, twitching stitches, and possibly preparing to puncture or “write through” if given enough light and blank surface.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[\"Warded sheet\"],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

The “bright fence” works—so long as you keep it steady and close.\n\nYou tug Halven and guide Senn up onto the nearest raised surface: a low sarcophagus plinth with a chipped marble lip. It’s cleaner than the floor—fewer cracks, fewer seams to hide in. Senn clambers up awkwardly, nearly slipping, but your grip on his sleeve keeps him upright. Halven steps up last, never turning his back to the floor-thread.\n\nBelow you, the filaments probe the base of the plinth, searching for a join. One finds a hairline fracture in the marble and tries to slip into it—then recoils when your lamp’s light pools there. It can’t climb into the lighted fracture, but it’s clearly *looking* for a way onto the raised stone.\n\nFrom the bend ahead: bootsteps resolve into two sets, then three. Ink-caps. Chain of keys. A soft scrape of a lantern hook.\n\nHalven leans close, voice barely above breath. “We don’t trust them with this,” he says. “Not the wrong wardens. They’ll seize your lamp and call it ‘unsafe illumination.’ And if they see Senn’s staining, they’ll quarantine him and write him into custody.”\n\nHe digs into his sleeve-cuff and produces a thin, thumb-sized shard of mica wrapped in wax paper—likely a page-protector turned to other use. He presses it into your palm. “Angle it. Keep the flame down. No direct glare.”\n\nAs he speaks, one of the approaching wardens calls around the corner, not yet seeing you: “Curfew audit. Lamps down and satchels open. Concord writ.”\n\nThe stitch-filaments below twitch at the sound, then go still—as if listening too.\n\n**Threats, immediate and concrete:**\n- The seam-thing is actively searching for a path onto the plinth via fractures and joins.\n- Three Warden-Scribes are seconds away from line-of-sight; if they spot your lamp and satchel, they will attempt confiscation under curfew authority.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"Mica shard (wax-wrapped)\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[\"Three Warden-Scribes (approaching, Candlelit Concord)\"]}\n```",

Meanwhile, a Grave-Gild courier slips her an invitation sealed with funerary gold: **Vigil-Auction, tonight—Lot 13: ‘Atlas-leaf, authenticated by candlelight.’** The invitation’s wax bears a thumbprint she recognizes from the monastery’s restricted stacks—someone who should be dead.\n\nEldra has a map that shouldn’t exist, a lamp everyone wants, and a line of text the dead seem willing to kill to finish."

Violet-dark fog clings to the stone path. The air tastes of wet paper and candle wax. Bone chimes on the gate shiver in the wind, each one striking a different note.\n\nYou stand just inside the arch, half-hidden behind a leaning angel marker, with your reliquary lamp hooded under your cloak. On your knee is a sheet of warded paper, and you write by touch as much as by sight—short lines, neat brackets, careful hashes. You compare the copied puddle-text to the ink that bled sideways into a crude margin-map: three circled mausoleums, one marked with a moth-wing sigil. You check the lamp’s wick-oil level like a ritual, then close your satchel before any wax-scent can carry.\n\nBootsteps scrape stone. A **Warden-Scribe** rounds the gatepost with a shuttered lantern and a slate badge of the **Candlelit Concord** pinned to his chest; his glove is stained with sealing wax. Behind him, a younger acolyte drags a canvas sack that clinks with confiscated lamps. The Warden stops a mourner ahead of you and says, flat and practiced, “Curfew inspection. Satchels open. Pages first.” The mourner’s journal is taken, thumbed, and dropped into the sack. The Warden’s eyes lift, catching the edge of your satchel strap, and his hand settles on the seal-stamp at his belt.\n\nAt the same time, a **Grave-Gild courier** slips through the bars of the gate like he belongs there: neat coat, gold-flecked gloves, and a mourning ribbon pinned too carefully. He doesn’t look at the Warden. He looks straight at you and extends a black envelope sealed with funerary gold. On the wax is a thumbprint you recognize from the monastery’s restricted stacks—someone who should be dead. The courier murmurs, “**Vigil-Auction. Lot Thirteen. Candle-authenticated.** They’re reading it aloud tonight.” He nods once toward the necropolis paths, where the stones ahead seem to repeat the same epitaph twice.\n\nThe Warden steps closer, lantern angled to your hands. The courier’s envelope waits, warm from his palm. Your lamp, your notes, and your name are all suddenly in reach of other people."

Violet-dark fog clings to the stone path. The air tastes of wet paper and candle wax. Bone chimes on the gate shiver in the wind, each one striking a different note.\n\nYou stand just inside the arch, half-hidden behind a leaning angel marker, with your reliquary lamp hooded under your cloak. On your knee is a sheet of warded paper, and you write by touch as much as by sight—short lines, neat brackets, careful hashes. You compare the copied puddle-text to the ink that bled sideways into a crude margin-map: three circled mausoleums, one marked with a moth-wing sigil. You check the lamp’s wick-oil level like a ritual, then close your satchel before any wax-scent can carry.\n\nBootsteps scrape stone. A **Warden-Scribe** rounds the gatepost with a shuttered lantern and a slate badge of the **Candlelit Concord** pinned to his chest; his glove is stained with sealing wax. Behind him, a younger acolyte drags a canvas sack that clinks with confiscated lamps. The Warden stops a mourner ahead of you and says, flat and practiced, “Curfew inspection. Satchels open. Pages first.” The mourner’s journal is taken, thumbed, and dropped into the sack. The Warden’s eyes lift, catching the edge of your satchel strap, and his hand settles on the seal-stamp at his belt.\n\nAt the same time, a **Grave-Gild courier** slips through the bars of the gate like he belongs there: neat coat, gold-flecked gloves, and a mourning ribbon pinned too carefully. He doesn’t look at the Warden. He looks straight at you and extends a black envelope sealed with funerary gold. On the wax is a thumbprint you recognize from the monastery’s restricted stacks—someone who should be dead. The courier murmurs, “**Vigil-Auction. Lot Thirteen. Candle-authenticated.** They’re reading it aloud tonight.” He nods once toward the necropolis paths, where the stones ahead seem to repeat the same epitaph twice.\n\nThe Warden steps closer, lantern angled to your hands. The courier’s envelope waits, warm from his palm. Your lamp, your notes, and your name are all suddenly in reach of other people."

At your question, he leans close enough that his breath smells faintly of clove and grave-dust.\n\n“Whose voice?” he repeats softly, as if tasting a forbidden word. “A *borrowed one*. They’ve hired a throat—someone who can read without *owning* the text. But the Atlas-leaf… it prefers the voice of the one who died with the thumbprint.” His gaze flicks to the seal, then away. “If that voice answers, the room goes very quiet.”\n\nThe Warden-Scribe steps in, putting himself between you and the gate’s shadow. “Inspecting,” he says, and the word is a verdict. He holds out his free hand—palm up—while his other thumb rests on the edge of his seal-stamp. “Pages. Any loose sheets. Any copied epitaphs. Any invitations.”\n\nBehind him, the younger acolyte shifts the canvas sack; glass clinks again—at least a dozen lamps already taken.\n\nThe courier straightens, suddenly all professional distance.

The sigil holds, but it strains: the crescent of grave-salt dulls from gray to a wet, used dark where your touch anchors it.\n\nWhen you offer the trade—name for epitaph—the mist compresses into something almost human-shaped. Script crawls along its surface, trying to assemble a single line that can survive the hush.\n\nIt manages three words, each one a wet tear:\n\n“CALDRIS—” (the sound sticks, like it’s swallowing a pin)\n“WROTE—”\n“ME.”\n\nThen it spasms, and the “face” in it flashes again: vellum skin, mouth stitched shut, the stitches moving like living cursive.\n\nA new sound joins the scraping behind it: a soft, rapid *tap-tap-tap* from deeper in the necropolis corridors, like fingernails on stone—coming closer, triangulating the gate by your lantern’s buried ember.\n\nThreat, explicit: something else is approaching from inside the necropolis—faster than the mist—drawn by the same keyed attention (your monastery-name, the seal, or the lamp). If it reaches the ward-line while the seal is still cracked, it may use the courier as a handle to pull on the city side."

The cloth-wrapped sheet stays pinned to the lantern’s backplate; you can hear the faintest tick as it cools against the brass.\n\nYou keep the warded-paper strip hovering in front of the courier’s belt like a flat, pale blade. With your other hand you scribble the epitaph fast—ink biting cleanly into the slip—fold it tight, salt the crease. When you slide it under the gate’s lowest gap, the paper catches for a heartbeat on rough iron… then slips through.\n\nInside the necropolis, the mist at the ward-line lunges—not across, but *down* toward the gap. It compresses, then pours itself along the stone like spilled breath. The folded packet vanishes into it.\n\nA sound like dry lips smacking follows. Then the mist swells, as if swallowing. The stitched-face flickers once, clearer than before—vellum skin, the mouth-seam tugging—then the whole column *thins* and pulls back from the ward-line by a handspan. The pressure against your hush-ring eases. It doesn’t leave, but it stops straining forward.\n\nYour warning—*leave my name alone*—gets an answer, scraped and small from the retreating fog:\n\n“NO NAME. ONLY LINE.”\n\nThe tapping from deeper inside changes: it pauses, then resumes closer, now with a second rhythm under it—like something dragging a chain or a pen-case on stone.\n\nThe courier obeys your order, trembling. “Slow. Slow—” he whispers to himself. He keeps his hands high and away from the wax as if it’s hot. With two fingers he hooks the belt buckle and works it loose in tiny increments.\n\nAs the belt slackens, the funerary-gold seal gives a faint *creak*—not cracking, but flexing, like wax warming near a hearth. The hairline seam you’d stopped tries to reopen.\n\nYour warded-paper “shield” catches it: the seam halts mid-flex, held in check, but you can tell it *wants* air.\n\nHe sets the belt down inside the salt circle, careful as placing a sleeping snake. Then he interlaces his fingers behind his head and freezes, eyes wide.\n\nThreat, immediate and concrete: something on the necropolis side is now within a few paces of the gate—close enough that the tapping is loud and directional. If the lantern opens or the belt-seal gets exposed to open air again, whatever’s approaching may use that as a target to strike through the ward-line, and the courier’s belt on the ground is now the most obvious “handle.”"

For a moment, the funerary-gold wax quiets, its hairline flex arrested.\n\nHalven keeps his lantern choked, shoulders rigid. He doesn’t answer your warning with words—just a sharp nod, eyes fixed on the shutter like he’s listening for a heartbeat inside it.\n\nYou slide the warded sheet under the belt strap. The leather drags with a damp squeal. As you inch it a half-step farther from the gate, the air *catches*—a brief suction toward the necropolis side, like the ward-line noticing something moved. The belt crosses your new salt “island” boundary by a finger’s width… and the wax responds immediately: the seal creaks and lifts a fraction, as if trying to inhale.\n\nWhen you slap the fresh ward-slip over the buckle, the paper adheres with a soft, papery *click*. The wax’s flex stops mid-rise. A thin line of heat crawls across the ward-slip—ink on the paper darkens along a single stroke, writing itself into a tiny, involuntary dash, then going still.\n\nFrom the necropolis side, the tapping halts.\n\nA chain scrapes once, slow and deliberate, and a shape resolves just beyond the ward-line: not a full figure, but an arrangement of parts the mist is willing to outline. A hand first—bone-white, ink-stained fingertips—holding a length of fine chain with a brass nib tied to it like a pendulum. Behind it, a hooded head is suggested by drifting moth-ash; where a face should be, there’s only layered paper, edges fluttering.\n\nIt does not cross. It leans close enough that the ward-line bows inward like glass under pressure.\n\nThe thing answers your question by *demonstration*: the brass nib on the chain taps the stone—once, twice—and each tap leaves a brief, wet-black mark that immediately tries to become a letter. The ward-line rejects the writing; the marks smear into illegible hooks and evaporate.\n\nA voice follows, dry as a page turned too fast. “CALDRIS IS A MARGIN. I DO NOT STITCH MARGINS.”\n\nThe chain lifts. The nib points—not at you, but at the belt inside the salt island.\n\n“HIS LINE HIDES IN GOLD.

It *stares back* as a hole in the sentence. Your throat tightens again, testing whether you’ll volunteer a syllable.\n\nHalven Rook is already there—close enough that his breath fogs faintly in the cold seep off the gate. He doesn’t look at the courier; he looks at your satchel and the ward-slip you just spent.\n\n“Spoken for?” he murmurs, and the words are careful, clipped. “I’m not bought. I’m **assigned**. Grave-Gild requested a ‘neutral witness’ for their Vigil-Auction and the Concord agreed—because the alternative is a riot of lamps and forged leaves.” His gaze flicks to the pinned strip. “You’re making that alternative.”\n\n“And Senn,” he says, quieter still, “is my acolyte. My runner. My liability.”\n\nThe courier’s eyes keep darting to the **[VACANT]** like it might climb out. He wets his lips, then forces the memory out as if it’s lodged behind his teeth.\n\n“First letter… I remember the *shape* more than the sound,” he whispers. “A tall hook. Like an **L**—or an old **I** with a thorn. The cadence was… three beats. Soft-hard-soft. Like a name you could sing and regret.”\n\nHe flinches, suddenly, because the pinned strip *scratches* under your ward-slip—tiny, rapid strokes. Not words. Practice. Like something learning your pressure.\n\n“If it stays vacant,” the courier says, voice thinning, “the vacancy doesn’t stay still. It starts borrowing. It takes names off stones, off ledgers, off throats. People forget who they are supposed to mourn, and the dead get… impatient.”\n\nAs he speaks, the seam around **[VACANT]** subtly widens—no more than a hair—but enough that the gate’s join sighs, and a faint, papery rasp leaks out from within, like pages being turned by someone with no hands.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[\"Warded paper (1 sheet)\"],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```"

Little bites. Saw-tooth but… soft. Cold. My eyes keep trying to slide off it.”\n\nThe courier—Grave-Gild coat, funerary-gold pin—keeps his hands visible and his voice low. “I see a clean oval of—” he stops, blinks hard, and corrects himself as if physically yanked. “I see the *stone stop*.

The air smells briefly of ozone and old iron—like a struck nail.\n\nYou dot the spot.\n\nThird pause: the slip warms, not the stone—your fingers feel heat *through the paper* as if the warding is doing work. A thin line of salt—gritty, deliberate—runs under moss, circling part of the boundary. Not natural seep: poured and brushed.\n\nWhen you ask for orders or scraps, Halven’s gloved hand goes to his satchel and stops, knuckles whitening. “I have a seal,” he says, and doesn’t move it yet. The courier obeys first: he kneels and sets a small folded document on the ground between you, waxed shut with funerary gold.\n\nThe wax bears the thorned L/I—pressed hard enough to crack the gold.

A *Vigil* notary—auction-side.” He points but doesn’t approach. “If the seal breaks, it’s not a curse. It’s a *notice*. The wax remembers the first eyes that open it. The notary gets that memory. So does anyone… listening through their ink.”\n\nHalven’s hand stays half in his satchel. He doesn’t look at the document now; he looks at your lamp, then at the salt. “Because mine isn’t funerary gold,” he says. “It’s Concord blackwax. It doesn’t just notify— it *binds*. And this thing—” he flicks two fingers toward the **[VACANT]** without fully pointing, as if afraid to give it a straight line— “is hungry for bindings.”\n\nYou scrape moss aside along your dotted segment.

Not collapse—more like a cover shifting a hair. Something small is anchored there, close to the surface.\n\nThe courier crouches, squinting. “That’s not a name,” he murmurs. “Names don’t ring.”\n\nHalven finally says what he’s been avoiding. “The thorned L/I isn’t ‘Lot’ or ‘Ledger.’ It’s **Lacuna Imprimatur**—a redaction authority. Permission to make a hole where a record used to be.” He swallows. “And if this is Concord salt… then someone tried to *pin* the lacuna in place with iron.”\n\nAs he says “iron,” the lamp’s smoke pulls sideways again—toward your dotted spot—like it’s being breathed in."

Your warded paper is resisting, but each contact risks it “catching” a letter."

The pressure under your hand turns into a trapped tremor, like a throat trying to speak with fingers on its mouth. Fine vibrations crawl up your wrist bones.\n\nThe courier jerks into the posture you order—nose pinched, sleeve between his teeth, eyes clenched shut. He makes a small, involuntary whine through fabric, then goes silent. You can see his chest trying not to rise.\n\nHalven steps in close on your blind side so his shadow blocks the seam from any stray lamplight. “Wax—yes,” he says, already digging into the inner pocket of his warden’s coat. “Seal-wax pellets. Not much.” He presses three dull, amber beads into your free hand without letting them clatter.\n\n“Pitch, no. But—” He pulls a stubby taper from a case and sparks it against his thumb-seal. A thin, steady flame catches—controlled, Concord-clean.\n\nAt your question about a counter-syllable, Halven’s jaw tightens. “You don’t *repeat* it,” he says. “Repetition makes a chorus. A chorus makes a doorway.” He leans to your ear, careful not to project toward the seam, and breathes the instruction as close as possible:\n\n“Break it with a null-mark. Not a word. A sound that means ‘unwritten.’ Click your tongue once, then exhale through teeth—*tch*—like crossing out ink. Do it only when it starts. Not before.”\n\nUnder your palm, the seam tests you: the tremor shifts, concentrating at one corner. Something hair-thin tries to worry its way between lid and frame. You feel a faint, slick pressure—like a filament pressing against skin, seeking a pore or crease.\n\nHalven holds the taper low. “If you lift even a finger, it’ll try to speak again,” he warns. “But if we melt wax into the edge, it’ll have to burn through to find air.”\n\nThe threat is immediate and physical now: a filament is probing for any gap under your hand, while the trapped Name-start is waiting for a moment of air or hearing to latch onto."

Halven threads the wax into the seam under your wrist in a slow, careful line. The first drip hisses as it meets the necropolis-cold metal, then clings. A second drip follows, then a third, each one thickening into a glossy ridge.\n\nUnder your palm, the trapped tremor changes pitch—less “throat,” more “insect in a jar.” The filament makes its move at the corner you’ve been feeling: it presses hard enough that you feel a distinct *sting*, like a needle trying to find purchase between skin and nail.\n\nYou soften a pellet in your free hand until it’s tacky, then smear it into that corner—wax pushed firmly into the angle where lid meets frame.\n\nThe filament touches the fresh wax and sticks.\n\nFor a heartbeat it holds—then it *pulls*, trying to draw the wax inward like thread through cloth. The wax stretches in a thin, pale strand… and snaps. The filament recoils, leaving a tiny hooked impression in the wax like a cursive thorn.\n\nFrom inside, the thing attempts sound again—muffled, forced, furious. The beginning of the syllable gathers against the sealed edge:\n\n“Al—”\n\nYou click once and cut it with a sharp *tch*.\n\nThe effect is immediate but not gentle. The sound inside collapses as if struck. The seam shudders so hard the lid tries to buck—your forearm absorbs the jolt. Halven flinches, then steadies his taper.\n\n“Good,” he mutters, voice tight. “Only on the start.”\n\nBut the null-sound has a consequence: the wax ridge you’ve just laid darkens in a thin line, as if a scorch-mark wrote itself across it. Not burned by flame—burned by *denial*. The ridge holds, yet you can see it turning brittle where the “unwritten” touched the Name-start.\n\nThe courier, still biting sleeve, makes a panicked, tiny inhale through his teeth. The seam answers at once—another hair-thin probe scrapes along the wax line, searching for the weak, darkened section.\n\nHalven swears under his breath and drips more wax to reinforce it. “If the courier breaks,” he says, “it’ll keep testing the wax until it finds a voice-gap.

No voice escapes—just a faint skin-squeak as his fingers tick numbers.\n\nThat helps immediately: the seam stops “listening” for him. The probing along the wax ridge becomes less frantic, more methodical—like a quill testing paper instead of a mouth hunting air.\n\nHalven answers your murmur without lifting his eyes to the lid. “Yes. Don’t *deny* it—*drown* it.” He shifts his taper away from the ridge so he isn’t heating the brittle line. “Concord uses a low prayer-hum. No consonants. All breath and vowel. It muddies the first letter without striking it.”\n\nHe demonstrates once, almost inaudible: a steady, throat-deep *oooo* shaped through closed lips, more vibration than sound.\n\nYou pull your warded paper strip. The moment it clears your satchel, the ink-side-out fold catches a sliver of mothlight and the warding glyphs wake—thin lines on the paper rise like gooseflesh. The air near the seam tightens as if the paper has just become the most interesting “page” in the alley.\n\nYou press the band over the wax ridge like a splint. It adheres—at first.\n\nThen the seam reacts to the warding: a sharp internal scrape runs the length of the lid, and a hair-thin filament *hooks* the paper band from underneath. You feel it tug, trying to pull the strip into the seam the way a needle pulls thread.\n\nYou smear soot-salt paste along the edges. The salt bites—there’s a faint crackle, and the filament recoils, leaving a tiny tear in the paper where it snagged. The soot makes the paste tacky; it seals the band down, but unevenly. One corner puckers where the filament tested it.\n\nOutcome: the “splint” holds for now, and the seam can’t easily probe the wax line. Consequence: the warded paper has become a lure—epitaph-spirits nearby shift toward you.

One wisp retreats toward its headstone and presses against the carved name there, dissolving into the letters like breath into stone.\n\nThe other does not go back. It skirts the edge of your light instead—clever, hungry—circling to keep the warded strip in sight. It’s closer now, a pale ribbon of punctuation with a faint face inside it, mouth a crease that keeps trying to open.\n\nYour lamp’s wider cast also catches something on the wall behind Halven: a pasted square of paper so thin it’s almost skin.

If my shadow slips, that thing starts listening again—and if the Wardens hear it tapping, they’ll blame the lamp.”\n\nAt the crack, the soot-salt band gives a soft, wet *tick*—a single stitch-like sound—then goes still.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"Charcoal rubbing of Halven's folded page crease-route (shows edited/crossed-out mausoleum; trace of funerary gold dust imprint)\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[\"Two unnamed Warden-Scribes (Candlelit Concord)\",\"Acolyte Senn (Candlelit Concord)\"]}\n```"

You drift into the side passage between leaning stones, your satchel hugged tight; the stones are close enough to brush your shoulders with lichen that feels like dry, curled paper.\n\nYour dutiful call carries.\n\nOne Warden-Scribe stops dead and lifts his lantern to a narrow slit. “Ledger-run?” he repeats, skeptical. The other’s gaze drops immediately to your satchel, then to your lamp. Acolyte Senn looks up sharply at the phrase “crossed-out mausoleum,” and you see his throat bob as he swallows.\n\n“Name your superior,” the first Warden calls, stepping toward the passage mouth. “And show the page-seal.”\n\nHalven answers before you can. “Rook. Warden-Scribe Halven Rook. This is my runner.” He raises his own seal-ring into the lantern slit, letting the Concord mark catch the light. It buys a heartbeat.\n\nNot trust—just procedure. The nearer Warden slows, but doesn’t retreat. “Rook. You’re off-route,” he says, and his free hand already has a thin strip of binding paper ready, like a leash for a page. “Satchel check anyway.

Fine.”\n\nYour warning about the stitching lands harder. The corridor behind them answers you: *tick tick*—then a third sound, a slow drag like thread being pulled through wet cloth. The air at the passage mouth cools abruptly, and the Warden’s lantern flame gutters to a thin, nervous tongue.\n\nBoth Wardens turn their heads toward the sound despite themselves.\n\nAcolyte Senn goes rigid. His eyes fix on the dark corridor, not your satchel. “It’s—” he starts, then swallows. “That crack was sealed with a concordance stitch. If it’s ticking, it means the seam is… being read.”\n\n“Being read by what?” the second Warden snaps, but his voice has lost some authority.\n\nSenn forces the words out, fast and ashamed. “An epitaph-spirit. A hungry one. It listens for lamplight and unfinished lines.”\n\nHalven doesn’t waste the opening. He steps half a pace forward—just enough to block the Wardens from pushing deeper into your little side passage—and points his lantern toward the corridor as if to take command of the problem. “You heard the acolyte,” he says. “If you want a spectacle, stand here and let it wake fully.”\n\nWhile their attention is dragged toward the corridor, you edge one step deeper between the leaning stones.\n\nYou get the concealment you wanted for a heartbeat—then your heel nudges something half-buried in moss: a small memorial bell on a hair-knot cord. It doesn’t ring. It *clicks* once, sharply, like a page-tab.\n\nThe nearer Warden’s eyes snap back to you immediately.\n\n“Hold,” he says, and this time he doesn’t reach into your satchel. He reaches for *you*—grabbing at your wrist to stop you backing farther in. “No further. Runner stays where I can see her.”\n\nAt the corridor mouth, the *tick tick* becomes a steady, patient rhythm, and the soot-salt smell turns sour, like damp ash. The crack isn’t open, but it is actively working—pressing, listening—drawn by the lamp’s presence and the Wardens’ exposed lanternflame.\n\nSenn looks between the corridor and your lamp, voice thin. “Warden… we should hood the lights.

He snaps his lantern-hood down with both hands. The light collapses from a steady glow to a thin crescent. The other Warden follows a beat later, muttering a quick Concord syllable as he shutters his own lantern. The path around you dims; the air pressure in the corridor eases slightly, like something disappointed.\n\nThe *tick tick* from the sealed crack slows.\n\nNot stops—slows, as if listening closer.\n\nYou lift the memorial bell by its hair-knot cord. Up close it’s not a bell at all—no clapper, no hollow. It’s a little brass tab stamped with a name that’s been scratched off so hard the metal is furred with burrs. The cord smells faintly of old rosemary and scalp-oil.\n\nHalven’s eyes narrow at it. “Grave-tab,” he confirms, low. “A locator. Someone left it to be found.”\n\nThe Warden holding your wrist doesn’t like that. “You don’t have leave to signal anything,” he snaps, and reaches with his free hand to take the tab from you.\n\nThe moment his fingers close around the brass, the tab gives a single, involuntary *click*—not loud, but sharp enough to feel in your teeth.\n\nThe corridor answers immediately.\n\nFrom the soot-salted crack comes a wet, satisfied inhale, and the seam-line—previously just a dark cut in stone—briefly brightens with hair-thin script, as if ink is surfacing under skin.

The tab drops, still dangling from your fingers. His grip on your wrist loosens half a fraction—not kindness, but fear.\n\nThen the crack gives a soft, tearing *thip*, like a stitch pulled too tight.\n\nA line of black thread—no thicker than a hair—pushes out through the seal and hangs in the air, wavering toward the nearest warmth and light: the thin crescent under Senn’s hood.\n\n“It’s not open,” Halven says, voice controlled but urgent. “But it’s reaching.”\n\nThe thread twitches, testing the air, and begins to drift—slowly, purposefully—toward Senn’s lantern."

When you pinch the thread to that edge, it catches with a tiny, resistant *tink*, like snagging a hook on cloth.\n\nThe moment you murmur “Read this instead,” the thread shivers and presses into the paper.

Under your warded sheet it spreads anyway, pressing up as raised, blind lettering. The moment your charcoal grinds down, the forming **SENN** buckles. The letters don’t vanish; they *misprint*. The name collapses into a thick bruise of black, and the ink tries to reassert itself at the margins—little hooked strokes searching for a clean edge to climb.\n\nYour epitaph—**ASHEN WITNESS**—lands like a stamp.\n\nThe pressure under the paper eases. Not gone—contained. The seam gives a small, audible *tck* as if a stitch has been tightened from the other side. The ink that had been trying to write a name turns greedy and drinks the charcoal instead, wicking it into thread-thin capillaries that spider out across your sheet… and then stop at the warding lines as if hitting glass.\n\nWhen you breathe the stitch-rite in one unbroken thread, your reliquary lamp answers without being asked: the flame narrows to a needlepoint, then steadies. Warmth travels up your wrist and into the paper, sealing it to the stone with a faint tackiness like cooling wax.\n\nHalven’s eyes flick to the lamp, then to your hands. “You just *reassigned* a claim,” he says, low and hard. “Do you understand what you fed it?”\n\nSenn trembles once, then goes still. When you finally ease your grip enough for him to whisper, he doesn’t speak a name—he rasps, “It was taking my… *index*. Like I was a word in its mouth.”\n\nFrom the sealed seam comes a new sound: not ink, not breath—*scratching*, slow and deliberate, as if something inside is trying to write its way out around your warded sheet. The paper holds, but the scratching starts to travel laterally along the stone, searching for another place to surface."

Don’t answer out loud.”  \n\nI pull a second warded sheet and start laying it edge-to-edge along the direction the scratching travels, like patching a running crack. “If it wants another mouth, we’ll give it paper—show me where you’re trying to write.”"

When you angle the reliquary lamp, the needle-flame throws a tight oval of light across the mausoleum’s face.\n\nThe scratching becomes visible in the lamplight as *movement in the stone’s dust*: fine grit shivers in a line, traveling rightward along a mortar seam. Where it passes, hairline script briefly lifts—pale, raised strokes like dried glue—then collapses back into plain stone. It’s not random. It’s *spelling while it searches*.\n\nSenn nods fast when you squeeze his shoulder—he can breathe. His eyes are wet and fixed on the seam like it’s a throat.\n\nHalven answers your question without taking his gaze off the wall. “An Ashen Witness buys you a substitute—an acceptable silence. It tells the claim there’s already a recorded absence, so it can stop hunting a living name.” His jaw tightens. “What it owes later is simple: testimony. Someday it will come to collect what the witness ‘saw and said nothing’ about. And it will try to make that true.”\n\nYou slide the second warded sheet edge-to-edge in the direction the scratching runs. The moment the paper overlaps the seam by a thumb’s width, the scratching *hits it*—hard enough that you feel the vibration through the sheet. A line of ink blooms under the paper like a bruise spreading in water, and for an instant letters try to emboss through from beneath, reversed as if read from inside a coffin.\n\nThen the warding bites. The ink stops at the sigils and begins to pool at the nearest unwarded edge—your overlap line—testing it like a tongue on a loose tooth.\n\nHalven shifts, bracing his shoulder against the mausoleum to keep the sheets from peeling. “It’s learning your seams,” he mutters. “Don’t give it gaps.”\n\nThe scratching abruptly detours *downward*, toward the base of the wall. Dust lifts in a narrow stream and skitters into a drainage crack between stones. The threat is clear: it’s trying to surface somewhere your paper can’t easily cover—below, where the wall meets the ground.\n\nFrom that crack, a thin exhale of cold air leaks out, smelling of wet vellum and old funerary gold."

He keeps his eyes open, staring at your hands like he’s afraid to blink and let a word slip out.\n\nYou tear a strip of warded paper, fold it tight into a crude wick, and ram it into the drainage crack.

Ink spreads under the second sheet in a thin, urgent line, racing for the nearest gap it can find: the edge where the two warded sheets meet.

The three sheets tack together into one continuous “skin.” The ink that had been writing along the join hits the new crosswise warding and stops dead, pooling in a blunt oval.

The darkening on the buffer stops spreading immediately. He exhales once, controlled, and doesn’t look at your lamp.\n\nYou tilt the lamp away. The patch drops into dim, indirect light; the twitching threads go still.

A hairline of cold creeps into your palm through the paper, like holding winter by a glove.\n\nWhen you whisper, “Can you hear without writing—yes or no?” the seam answers without words.\n\nThe stitched threads beneath your warded sheet begin to move in a deliberate pattern: two short tugs, then a long one—like a practiced signal.

He keeps his ink-buffer between his palm and the cloth now, not trusting bare contact. “Don’t run,” he murmurs, more command than comfort.\n\nSenn swallows, nods, and tests his legs.

Concord wards *repel*—they don’t hunt. An Archivist could design the *theory*, but this feels… field-trained.”\n\nShe answers your second question like she hates that she knows it. “It finds *reference points*. Things that ‘belong’ in a record: signatures, true names, blood that’s been written into oath-ledgers. And—” a pause, “—lamp-oil that’s been blessed and catalogued.”\n\nAt that, Lute’s knuckles whiten around his hooded lantern handle.\n\nYou keep the mica strip steady on the main crack. With your other hand you tear a narrow ribbon from a fresh warded sheet—paper fibers resist, then give with a dry, clean rip—and you slide the ribbon out along the floor.\n\nIt moves smoothly for a handspan… then stops dead against something you can’t see.\n\nNot stone. Not grit.\n\nThe ribbon’s edge *sticks* as if it’s kissed pitch. A hair-fine line rises from the hairline branch—so thin it’s almost nothing—touches the ribbon, and tries to climb it the way it was climbing the plinth seam.\n\nThe warding holds, but you’ve learned something important by accident: **there was already a second filament in the branch crack, waiting, and it will test anything you feed into that fissure.**\n\nLute leans his head just enough to sight along the floor without moving his feet. “Left,” he says, voice tight. “Two finger-widths left of your paper-tab—there’s a split. And—gods—another one right, closer to me. One finger-width off my toe. Don’t—don’t make me step.”\n\nAs he speaks, the main filament you’ve been painting with mica slackens, then slides backward, *away* from the reflection—only to angle toward that left split Lute indicated, seeking a route around your first warded barrier.\n\nClear threat: **the finder-stitch is now attempting to bypass your primary dam via the left branch, while a second, thinner filament is already active in the branch where your ribbon caught. If either finds an unwarded seam past your patches, it can reach Lute (and any muffled metal, lamp, or catalogued oil) from underneath.**\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[\"Warded sheet (torn into ribbon; partially adhered at branch crack)\"],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```"
