### Turn 4 [PLAYER]

Lena Marrow grew up in a dockside tenement where keeping quiet and watching everything was the difference between eating and bleeding. Now a private investigator specializing in missing persons, she moves through rain-stained alleys with a notebook, a cigarette, and the patience to wait for the truth to slip. Careful, observant, and relentlessly methodical, she thinks three moves ahead and rarely trusts first impressions. She’s driven to find her younger brother’s killer—and to prove the city’s “accidents” are anything but.

*Agent reasoning: Generated cautious-style character for Noir Mystery*

### Turn 5 [GAME]

Here's your character:

**Lena Marrow**
*Private Investigator (Missing Persons Specialist)*

Raised in a dockside tenement, Lena learned early that silence, sharp eyes, and knowing when to disappear kept you alive. After her younger brother died in a case the police filed as an "accident," she clawed her way into the private trade—first as a runner for a bail bondsman, then as an investigator with a reputation for finding people who don’t want to be found. She keeps a battered notebook of patterns she’s noticed across the city’s so-called mishaps, convinced they’re connected and that someone powerful is cleaning up the evidence.

**Traits:** Observant, Relentlessly methodical, Patient, Cautious and distrustful of first impressions, Strategic thinker
**Goal:** Identify and bring down the person(s) responsible for her younger brother’s death by proving the city’s string of "accidents" are coordinated murders—and survive long enough to make the truth stick.

### Turn 9 [GAME]

Night, Harbor City—Saint Brigid Parish on Brine Street, three blocks off Pier Nine. Rain hammers the slate steps and runs in thin streams into the gutter grates. The soup line curls along the brick wall under a flickering streetlamp, and the air tastes of diesel and boiled onions.

You stand under the church’s awning with your collar up, notebook open on your palm so the pages don’t soak through. You count faces the way you count exits: slow, patient, twice. A runner’s habit never leaves; you keep your back to stone, eyes on hands, and you let other people think you’re just another cold body waiting for food.

A man in a dock patrol coat stops at the head of the line and flashes a badge to no one in particular. He’s broad in the shoulders, hair clipped close, and you know his jawline from the morgue corridor the day they told you your brother’s death was an accident. He speaks to the volunteer with the ladle, voice flat. “We’re looking for runaways. No papers. New arrivals. Guild wants names before midnight inspections.” The volunteer hesitates, and the patrolman’s gloved hand rests on the baton at his belt like it’s part of the uniform. Two men loiter across the street under a shuttered fishmonger sign, pretending to smoke while they watch the line and the church door. Then you see the detail that doesn’t fit: a girl near the wall has salt crusted at her cuffs and a yellowing bruise on her inner elbow, like a sedation injection. When she shifts, a torn tag slips from her sleeve and sticks to her wet skin—Meridian Assurance underwriting code, the same format you’ve got penciled beside your brother’s file.

Sister Calwen appears in the doorway and catches your eye. She tilts her head once toward the side entrance that leads down to the crypts, then looks past you at the patrolman as he starts down the line, asking for names.

### Turn 10 [PLAYER]

I drift down the line like I’m just making room, stopping beside the bruised girl. In a low voice: “Don’t look at me—can you walk? Sister’s taking people in the side door.” I angle my body to block the patrolman’s view and, if she moves, I guide her toward Calwen’s side entrance, watching the two “smokers” across the street the whole time.

*Agent reasoning: Patrol is sweeping for names; the girl with Meridian tag is a lead and in immediate danger. Calwen’s signaling a safer route—better to get the girl inside without drawing eyes, and learn what the patrol’s really after.*

### Turn 11 [GAME]

The girl flinches at your voice like it’s a slap, then forces herself to keep her eyes on the soup pot. Up close, the bruise on her inner elbow is the color of old ink, and there’s a faint antiseptic smell under the wet wool of her sleeve.

She answers without turning her head. “I can—” Her jaw tightens. “Not fast.”

You shift in front of her as the patrolman reaches the next cluster of bodies. For half a breath it works: your coat and shoulder take up the patrolman’s line of sight, and the girl uses the moment to step out of the queue like she’s just giving someone room. You put a hand lightly at her elbow—guiding, not dragging—and angle her toward the narrow side passage beside the church.

Across the street, one of the “smokers” stops pretending. He drops his cigarette, grinds it out with a neat heel, and pushes off the wall. The other stays put but turns his head, tracking you. Their attention isn’t casual; it’s practiced, like they’ve been told what to look for.

The patrolman hears the scuff of feet on wet stone and snaps his gaze over the line. His eyes catch the girl’s salt-stained cuffs and the way she favors one leg. “Hey.” He steps toward you, hand leaving the baton and opening like he’s going to take a wrist. “You—stop. Where’s she going?”

Sister Calwen is already at the side entrance, half in shadow, keys in hand. She doesn’t call out. She just holds the door cracked, watching you and the patrolman with a face that doesn’t give him anything to hook.

The girl’s breathing goes shallow. She whispers, almost into your collar, “If he sees my arm—” and she tugs her sleeve down hard enough to wince.

The nearer smoker has crossed the street curb-to-curb and is now ten paces away, coming in at an angle that will cut off the passage if he keeps walking. He doesn’t show a badge. He doesn’t need to. His right hand stays in his coat pocket like it’s holding something heavy.

You’re between the patrolman and the girl, with the side door three steps away—and someone is moving to box you in.

### Turn 12 [PLAYER]

I lift both hands, palms out, and put my body between his reach and the girl. “Easy—she’s about to be sick. Sister Calwen’s got a cot and a bucket inside.” Without looking back, I murmur to the girl, “Now. Through the door—don’t run.” Then I flick my eyes to the approaching smoker and call out, sharp, “You with Dock Patrol? Badge out if you’re stepping in.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m outnumbered and about to get boxed in; my best shot is to stall the patrolman with something official-sounding while getting the girl through the door, and keep my hands visible so nobody has an excuse to hit first.*

### Turn 13 [GAME]

Your hands go up, palms clean and open. The patrolman checks his step—half a pause, not mercy, just calculation. Your body blocks his reach, and for a second his eyes flick past you to the girl’s sleeve like he’s trying to see through cloth.

“About to be sick,” you say. “Sister’s got a cot and a bucket.”

Sister Calwen doesn’t miss the opening. She swings the side door wider just enough to make a gap, and the girl slips through it on your cue—no run, just a stiff, careful walk like she’s afraid her joints will give out. Calwen’s hand closes around the girl’s shoulder and pulls her inside. The door starts to come shut.

The patrolman lunges a step too late and catches the edge of the door with his boot. Wood thuds against leather. “Hold it,” he barks, suddenly loud enough to turn heads in the soup line. “Guild business. I need to—”

Calwen’s voice comes out calm, edged with steel. “Not in my parish you don’t. If you have a warrant, you can show it in the daylight like a civilized man.”

Your shout at the approaching “smoker” lands. “You with Dock Patrol? Badge out if you’re stepping in.”

He stops—two paces short of the passage mouth—and smiles without warmth. He slowly removes his hand from his coat pocket. No badge. Just a small, flat brass token on a chain, flashed and tucked away again too fast for anyone else to catch. Enough to tell you he’s not patrol; he’s something adjacent that doesn’t answer to uniforms.

“Watch your tone,” he says, quiet, and then to the patrolman without looking at him: “She’s not on the list. Let the Sister close her door.”

The patrolman’s face tightens. He keeps his boot in the door a beat longer, then withdraws it like he’s doing Calwen a favor. The door shuts—firm, final. The girl is inside.

Across the street, the second loiterer pushes off the wall and starts walking too—not toward the church, but down the block, taking a line that’ll put him on the far end of the alley that runs behind Saint Brigid. A net, not a rush.

The patrolman points at you with two fingers. “You. I know you. Don’t make this about you tonight.” Then he turns and starts back down the soup line, asking names louder than before, punishing the room for being watched.

The brass-token man stays where he is, eyes on you, measuring. “You just bought her five minutes,” he says. “What’re you spending them on?”

*Triggered: fail_Ing Smoker And Call Out_0_0d7fdb, secret_Ing Smoker And Call Out_0_1a00c0*

### Turn 14 [PLAYER]

I keep my hands visible and my voice even. “On keeping her alive. What list—whose?”  

Without turning my back, I glance toward the man heading for the alley and then back to the token. “And what are you, exactly, flashing brass in a church line?”

*Agent reasoning: The brass-token man is leverage and a threat; I need to learn who he is and what list he means without giving him my intentions. Also someone is moving to the alley—possible grab team—so I should keep eyes on exits and get Calwen warned.*

### Turn 15 [GAME]

The brass-token man keeps his hands empty and low, like he’s showing you he doesn’t need to hurry. Rain beads on the brim of his hat and runs in clean lines down his coat. Up close you catch the scent of clove smoke—cover for something sharper underneath.

“Whose list?” he repeats, like it’s a joke that isn’t funny. “Meridian’s, dressed up in Guild ink. Names that ‘need correcting.’ People that make policies… complicated.”

When you ask what he is, his eyes flick toward the soup line where the patrolman is still barking for paperwork. Then back to you.

“I’m the part that keeps tonight from turning into a street fight,” he says. “Call me a mediator.”

He shifts his weight—subtle—and you realize he’s positioned so he can see both the side door and the street corner. Not protecting you. Controlling angles.

Behind you, the side door latch clicks again from inside—Sister Calwen throwing an extra bolt. Whatever route she’s using, she’s committing to it.

Down the block, the second man reaches the mouth of the alley behind Saint Brigid. He doesn’t go in right away. He pauses, looks up at the church’s rear windows, then slips into the darkness. A moment later, you hear a soft metallic scrape—like a trash lid being eased, not kicked.

The brass-token man watches your face as if he expects you to run for the alley. “If you go back there,” he says softly, “you’ll meet someone who doesn’t flash anything before he works.”

Across the line, the patrolman’s voice rises again: “No papers? Then step out. Now.” You hear a small protest, a chair leg skittering on wet stone, and the volunteer with the ladle says, “Officer, please—”

The brass-token man takes one step closer—close enough that you can see the faint scar at the corner of his mouth. “You’re Lena Marrow,” he says, not asking. “Meridian already left a card at your office this morning. That means they’re not hunting blind anymore. So: walk away from Saint Brigid tonight, or you’ll force the Sister to choose between her people and you.”

He tilts his head toward the street, where the patrolman is starting to pull someone out of line by the sleeve. “And you’ve got about ten seconds before that turns ugly.”

*Triggered: fail_Ing Smoker And Call Out_0_0d7fdb, secret_Ing Smoker And Call Out_0_1a00c0*

### Turn 16 [PLAYER]

I lean slightly toward the brass-token man, voice low. “Mediator for who? Give me a name I can write down.”

Then I step toward the soup line, hands still visible. “Officer—she’s with me. I’ll vouch. No need to yank people around in the rain.” I angle my body so I can still see the street corner and call to the volunteer, “Sister Calwen inside? Someone get her—now.”

*Agent reasoning: I don’t want a fight here—too many civilians and it risks drawing attention to the girl. But I can’t just leave; I need info on “Meridian’s list” and I can defuse the patrolman without escalating. I’ll stall the mediator for a name while I intervene verbally with the patrolman, keeping distance from the alley threat.*

### Turn 17 [GAME]



*Triggered: fail_Ing Smoker And Call Out_0_0d7fdb, secret_Ing Smoker And Call Out_0_1a00c0*

### Turn 18 [PLAYER]

I freeze for a beat with my hands still up, scanning the patrolman, the brass-token “mediator,” and the alley mouth behind Saint Brigid. “Alright—what just changed? Who’s in the alley, and who do you answer to?” Then I call toward the side door, “Sister Calwen—are you there? Do you have another exit?”

*Agent reasoning: The scene seems to have advanced without text; I need to re-establish what happened and avoid walking into an unseen consequence. I’ll pause, keep sightlines, and press for immediate info from the nearest threats/anchors: the patrolman, the brass-token man, and Calwen.*

### Turn 19 [GAME]

Your shout for Sister Calwen carries farther than you want. Heads turn. The patrolman’s grip tightens on the sleeve of a thin woman he’s half-dragged out of line; she stumbles, catches herself on a soup table, and the ladle volunteer backs away like she’s been burned.

The brass-token man’s expression changes first—his jaw sets, his eyes go briefly flat.

“What just changed?” he says. “You said her name out loud.”

He doesn’t answer the “who do you answer to” directly. Instead he reaches into his coat slowly, like he’s giving you time to decide whether to panic, and produces a folded card stock—thick, expensive. He holds it up just long enough for you to see a blind-embossed mark: **MERIDIAN ASSURANCE COMBINE**. No name, no title. Just a policy-number string stamped in black at the bottom. Then it’s back in his pocket.

“I answer to the paper,” he says. “Same as everyone else.”

From the alley mouth behind Saint Brigid, you see movement: the man who slipped in is no longer alone. A second figure steps into view behind him—shorter, shoulders squared, cap pulled low. They don’t rush. They position themselves: one near the trash bins, one near the rear wall, both watching the church’s back windows and the side door. One of them has something in his hand that catches the streetlamp for a blink—metal, narrow. A tool, or a blade.

Your call to the side door gets an answer, but not from the door. It comes from a grated basement window set into the church foundation, a few feet from the steps.

Sister Calwen’s voice, tight and controlled: “I’m here. Stop calling my name.”

A pause—then, quieter: “Yes. There’s a way through. But if they hear where, it becomes a trap.”

The patrolman swings his head toward you, eyes narrowing. “Marrow,” he says, like a warning. He lets go of the woman’s sleeve and steps toward you instead, hand hovering near his baton. “You obstructing an inquiry? Because I can make that official.”

The brass-token man shifts half a step—placing himself so he can block the patrolman’s line to you if it comes to it, while still keeping the alley in his peripheral. “This is how it starts,” he murmurs. “Noise. Then bodies.”

You now have two clear threats: the patrolman escalating in front, and two men setting up behind the church—watching for any exit Calwen uses.

*Triggered: fail_Ing Smoker And Call Out_0_0d7fdb, secret_Ing Smoker And Call Out_0_1a00c0*

### Turn 20 [PLAYER]

I take a slow step back, palms still up, and put a little space between me and the patrolman. “Not obstructing—just keeping your line from turning into a riot. I’ll shut up and stand aside.”

Without looking down at the grate, I murmur, “Sister—move her now, but not out back. If you’ve got an interior route, use it. Don’t tell me where.” Then, to the Meridian man, low: “If your people are in that alley, call them off. Or tell me what they’re waiting to catch.”

*Agent reasoning: I’ve escalated things by making noise; I need to de-escalate the patrolman to buy time, while quietly coordinating with Calwen. I also need a better read on the Meridian man and the alley threat without getting boxed in.*

### Turn 21 [GAME]

Your retreat and the promise to stand aside takes a little wind out of the patrolman. His hand drops from the baton to his belt, but he doesn’t relax—he uses the space you give him to reclaim the line.

“Good,” he says. He turns back to the soup queue and points at two people in quick succession. “You. And you. Papers.” His tone says he’s punishing the whole line for your interference.

At the basement grate, there’s a faint scrape—something heavy sliding over stone. Calwen doesn’t answer you with words. She answers with action: the volunteer with the ladle suddenly pivots, blocking the patrolman’s view of the church steps with her body and a sloshing pot, while another volunteer “accidentally” knocks over a crate of stale rolls, drawing eyes and curses. It’s clumsy on purpose. Cover.

In that same beat, the thin woman the patrolman had yanked is guided—not pushed, guided—back into the press of bodies and then sideways toward the church wall. She disappears behind the volunteers’ skirts and the steam off the soup pot. No one sees a door open. No one sees a door close. She’s just… gone from the line.

Behind Saint Brigid, the alley figures react to the sudden bustle. The shorter one raises a hand once—two fingers, quick—and the man by the bins shifts position to get a better angle on the foundation windows. They’re not “your people” in the sense of obeying you, and they don’t look like they’re taking orders from the brass-token man either.

When you press him—call them off or tell you what they’re waiting to catch—his mouth tightens.

“They’re waiting on a mistake,” he says. “A door. A hatch. A face they can swear they recognized.”

He glances past you at the patrolman. “And he’s waiting for you to make one.”

The patrolman snaps, loud enough for the block to hear: “Nobody moves off that line unless I say so.” He steps closer to the church steps, trying to reassert control of the space you just helped Calwen blur.

The brass-token man leans in, voice barely above the rain: “If you keep standing here, you become the reason they search the church. If you leave, you become the reason the alley men follow.”

Concrete threat, now: the patrolman is about to order a search of Saint Brigid’s entrance area, and the two in the alley are poised to intercept anyone exiting through a low route along the foundation.

*Triggered: fail_Ing Smoker And Call Out_0_0d7fdb, secret_Ing Smoker And Call Out_0_1a00c0, fail_Ing Smoker And Call Out_1_9e21d1*

### Turn 22 [PLAYER]

I give the Meridian man a flat look. “Then I won’t make one.”  

I raise my voice just enough for the patrolman to hear: “Officer—fine. I’m leaving the line.” Then I turn and walk away from Saint Brigid at an unhurried pace, angling toward the corner as if I’m done—while watching reflections in the wet windows for anyone peeling off to follow.  

As I pass the first stack of crates, I “trip” and knock one hard into the street. “Sorry—watch it!” I call, making a small, messy commotion to pull eyes and bodies away from the church steps.

*Agent reasoning: If I stay, I draw a search onto Calwen and the parish; if I bolt toward the alley, I confirm there’s something to catch. Best move is to bleed attention away from the church without looking like I’m coordinating—create a plausible disturbance down the block and drift with it, keeping the alley in view.*

### Turn 23 [GAME]

The patrolman takes your “I’m leaving” as a win he can display. “Good,” he barks, loud. “Keep walking.” He jabs two fingers toward the line again. “Papers out. Now.”

You turn away at an unhurried pace. In the wet glass of a shuttered storefront, you catch three reflections that matter:

1) The patrolman’s head swiveling, tracking you until you’re two storefronts away.  
2) The brass-token Meridian man not following—staying planted near the church steps, watching the alley mouth like he’s measuring timing.  
3) A fourth reflection that wasn’t there before: a man peeling off from the edge of the soup line, hat brim low, moving after you with the practiced casual of someone trying not to look like he’s moving after you.

Your “trip” sends a crate corner-first into the street with a hollow crack. Produce rolls out, wet paper wrapping tearing. People jump back; one dockhand curses and grabs his shin. A wagon driver yanks his reins, shouting as a wheel splashes through a puddle and clips the crate—wood splinters snap and skid.

The commotion does what you want—half the line’s attention snaps away from the church steps. Two volunteers surge forward, scolding and shooing bodies back from the street. For a moment, the church entrance area is less watched.

But it also gives the patrolman an excuse to move.

“Clear that!” he snaps, and steps off his post toward the street mess—close enough now that he can see along the church wall and the steps again. He gestures to a second uniform you hadn’t clocked at first—standing under the eave across the way—who starts angling toward the church side door with a hand on his coat like he’s ready to push through if ordered.

Behind you, the man who peeled off keeps coming. In the window reflection, he doesn’t hurry; he uses the same pauses you do—stops when you stop, resumes when you resume. When you glance at a different pane of glass, you see a second tail join: someone stepping out of the alley mouth behind Saint Brigid and taking the cross-street to shadow you from the far side.

Threat is now clear and immediate: you have **two separate followers** triangulating you as you leave—one from the soup line, one from the alley—while the patrol presence at Saint Brigid shifts toward the side door, increasing the risk of a forced entry/search.

### Turn 24 [PLAYER]

I keep walking like I don’t notice, then cut into a crowded, well-lit corner shop as if I’m just getting out of the rain; once inside, I drift to the back and watch the door and front window reflections to confirm who follows.  

If one or both come in, I step to the counter and say to the clerk, loud and steady, “I’m being followed—if I ask, will you call for a patrol?” Then I slip out the shop’s back exit (if it has one) and double back along the next building line to see if I can spot the alley tail crossing to reacquire me.

*Agent reasoning: Two tails means I can’t lead them back to Calwen or my office. I need to confirm the tails, shake at least one, and if I can’t, steer them somewhere controlled with witnesses and multiple exits.*

### Turn 25 [GAME]

You cut into a corner shop with a bright sodium sign—**KELP & CANDLE**—half grocery, half household junk. The bell over the door gives you away with a cheerful chime that doesn’t fit the night. Inside it’s crowded: wet coats, cigarette breath, a couple of dockhands buying cheap lamp oil and bread.

You drift toward the back beside stacked tins and mop buckets, using the front window as a mirror.

The **first tail** (from the soup line) reaches the door in under ten seconds. He pauses outside like he’s reading the handbills taped to the glass, then steps in, shakes rain off his sleeves, and pretends to browse the dry goods—eyes flicking to the back aisles in quick, controlled checks.

The **second tail** (from the alley) doesn’t enter. In the window reflection you catch him crossing the street slowly, stopping under the awning of the pawnshop opposite, posture angled so he can see the shop door without looking like he’s watching it.

When the first tail drifts closer—close enough you can smell wet wool—you move to the counter.

The clerk is a narrow man with ink-stained fingers and a tired apron. You say, loud and steady, “I’m being followed—if I ask, will you call for a patrol?”

The clerk’s eyes jump to the tail, then to the street, then back to you. He doesn’t refuse, but he doesn’t commit either. “Patrol’s already thick tonight,” he says carefully, voice raised to match yours. “You cause trouble in my shop, they’ll treat it like my trouble.”

The tail at the dry goods shelf turns a tin over, reading the label like it’s fascinating. He doesn’t leave.

You scan for a back exit. There is one—**a curtained door marked “STOCK”** behind the counter. But as you angle your head, you see the detail that kills the easy escape: a **chain looped through the back door’s push bar**, padlocked from the inside. The clerk follows your glance and says, flat: “Back’s not for customers.”

Outside, through the front glass, the alley-tail under the pawnshop awning shifts—then raises two fingers briefly to someone out of frame, like a signal.

A moment later, the shop bell chimes again. A **second man** steps in—different from the first tail, heavier build, hands bare despite the cold. He doesn’t browse. He just stands by the door, blocking the easiest exit without making it look like he’s blocking it.

Threat, plain: you’re now **contained in the shop**—one watcher inside “shopping,” one inside on the door, and at least one set of eyes outside coordinating. If you force the back, it becomes a scene; if you leave the front, you step into their hands.

### Turn 26 [PLAYER]

I turn to the clerk and speak like I’m making a normal purchase, loud enough for the whole front to hear. “Two lamp oils and a pack of matches—on credit if you can. And write the names down: first man in the wool coat by the tins, second man by your door. If anything happens to me, you tell the patrol they followed me in.”

Then I raise my chin toward the door-blocker. “Either buy something or stop standing like a bouncer—you're scaring off business.” I let the silence hang, eyes flicking to the customers. “Anyone here know Officer Harlan? He was just two streets over harassing a soup line—he’ll love this.”

I stay planted at the counter, one hand on my notebook inside my coat, the other flat on the wood—no sudden moves—watching which one reaches first.

*Agent reasoning: I’m boxed in; I need witnesses and leverage, not a fight. Best move is to make it publicly expensive for them to grab me, and create a reason for a patrolman to walk in without me “calling for help.”*

### Turn 27 [GAME]

Your “purchase” voice carries. Heads turn. A dockhand with a bandaged knuckle pauses mid-coin-count. A woman with a basket of onions stops and looks from you to the men like she’s doing arithmetic.

The clerk swallows, then reaches under the counter and sets down two squat tins of lamp oil and a paper-wrapped match pack—more to have his hands doing something than to help you. He doesn’t say “credit.” He says, carefully, “That’ll be six bits.”

When you tell him to write the names down, he doesn’t pick up a pen. Instead, he lifts his chin toward a small slate behind him—inventory marks—and says, just as loud, “I don’t write down customers. I sell goods.” His eyes flick once to the padlock chain on the stock door, then back to you: warning without words.

Your call-out lands.

The wool-coat man by the tins stops pretending. He sets the tin down with deliberate care and walks closer, slow, palms visible. “No one’s hurting you,” he says, voice pitched to sound reasonable to bystanders. “You’re making a scene.”

The door-blocker doesn’t answer you at all. He shifts his stance—still “just standing”—but his shoulder now covers the door handle fully. He glances outside through the glass, then back in.

“Officer Harlan?” a customer near the bread rack says, uncertain. “I know him.” It’s not helpful; it’s fear dressed up as civic pride.

And then the outside coordination becomes action: through the front window you see a uniform approaching at a brisk walk from the pawnshop side—cap low, rain shining on his sleeves. Not Harlan. Another patrolman. He slows as he nears the shop, assessing the faces inside.

The wool-coat man closes to within arm’s reach of the counter, still with open hands. “Come on,” he says softly, for you now, not the room. “Let’s take this outside. You don’t want them asking you questions in here.”

The threat is immediate and specific: you’ve drawn patrol attention, but it’s not automatically protection—**the arriving officer can just as easily decide you’re the disturbance**, and the two men are positioning to steer you out the front door the moment he enters, where the outside watcher can join in.

No one has grabbed you yet. They’re waiting for the uniform to tip the balance.

### Turn 28 [PLAYER]

I square my shoulders toward the door and call out to the approaching patrolman before he steps in. “Officer—this man’s blocking the exit and that one’s been tailing me. I’m not leaving with either of them. I’d like your name and badge number, and I want you to ask them for theirs.”

I slide six bits onto the counter without taking my eyes off the door-blocker. “I’m a paying customer, and I’m staying right here.”

Then, to the wool-coat man, calm but hard: “Step back. If you touch me, I scream, and everyone in here becomes a witness.”

*Agent reasoning: Patrol could treat me as the problem; I need to control the narrative before the men steer me outside. Stay in public view, keep hands visible, and force the officer to address the men’s behavior too.*

### Turn 30 [PLAYER]

I keep my palms visible on the counter and call to the patrolman at the door, “Officer—before you step in, I need your name and badge number. These two have been tailing me and one’s blocking the exit. I’m not leaving with them.”  

I nod once at the clerk. “If anything happens, you saw who was here—please tell the patrol.”  

Then I look the door-blocker dead on. “Move off the handle. Now.”

*Agent reasoning: No new scene text came through, so I’ll hold my ground and try to anchor the situation to the arriving patrolman while keeping my hands visible and forcing names/badge numbers—low-risk, high-information.*

### Turn 31 [GAME]

The patrolman stops with one boot on the shop’s threshold, rain dripping off his cap brim onto the welcome mat. He doesn’t come in yet. His eyes rake the room: you at the counter, the heavy man planted by the door, the wool-coat man too close to you, the customers frozen mid-purchase.

“Name’s **Officer Rusk**,” he says, not raising his voice. He taps the number on his badge with two fingers like it ought to be enough. “Now lower the temperature.”

He points with his chin at the door-blocker. “You. Step aside.”

The heavy man doesn’t argue—but he also doesn’t really comply. He slides half a step so the handle is visible again, while keeping his body between you and the street. It’s a concession that still functions like a trap.

Wool-coat lifts his hands higher, performing innocence for the room. “Officer, she’s wound up. We’re just trying to talk—”

Rusk cuts him off without looking at him. “Did I ask you to talk?”

Your nod to the clerk draws a reaction: the clerk finally reaches for a stub of pencil, hesitates, then scratches something on the slate behind him—no names, just marks like he’s recording a sale. His eyes won’t meet yours.

Rusk steps fully inside and the bell rings. That sound breaks the spell—one customer backs away toward the bread rack; another slips out the side of the aisle like he doesn’t want to be remembered.

Rusk addresses you directly, flat and procedural. “You’re claiming you’re being followed. Do you have a name? A reason? Or do you just want me to throw two men out of a shop because you don’t like their faces?”

As he speaks, the heavy man by the door takes advantage of the officer’s body now between you and the street: he reaches behind him and turns the lock bolt on the door with a quiet *click*. You see it happen. The front exit is now **locked from the inside**.

Rusk doesn’t react to the click—either he didn’t hear it, or he’s choosing not to.

The immediate threat is clear: you’re now in a locked room with two men who’ve contained you, and the only uniform present is treating this like *your* complaint to prove, not their behavior to stop.

### Turn 32 [PLAYER]

I jerk my chin at the door, eyes on Rusk. “Officer Rusk—he just locked the front door. That’s unlawful restraint. Open it, now.”

I slide a half-step sideways to keep the counter between me and wool-coat, palms still visible. To the room: “Did you all hear that click? Anyone see him turn the bolt?”

Then, to Rusk, steady: “I don’t need a reason to walk out of a shop. I’m leaving. If they stop me, you’ll have your reason.”

*Agent reasoning: Rusk may be compromised or just lazy; I need him focused on the locked door as an objective fact, not my story. Create witnesses, keep distance, and force Rusk to act on the unlawful confinement.*

### Turn 33 [GAME]

Rusk’s eyes flick to the door. For the first time his expression tightens—annoyance, not alarm.

“Unlock it,” he says, voice low.

The heavy man doesn’t move. He keeps his shoulder angled toward you, chin down. “Door’s been sticking all week,” he says, like it’s a joke that’s supposed to land.

Rusk takes one step toward him. “Now.”

Wool-coat shifts too—just a half-step, trying to keep himself between you and Rusk’s line of sight. “Officer, she’s—”

Rusk snaps his gaze to wool-coat. “Back. Against the shelves.”

Wool-coat obeys, but slow, eyes never leaving you. He’s measuring distance.

You ask the room about the click. A thin man near the bread rack gives a quick, frightened nod—yes, he heard it—but he doesn’t speak. The woman with the onions whispers, “I heard,” then immediately looks down like she’s afraid her own voice will be held against her. No one offers a full statement. They’re witnesses in the way a city is: present, careful, and already rehearsing denial.

Rusk closes on the heavy man and reaches for the bolt himself.

That’s when the heavy man finally moves—fast. He catches Rusk’s wrist with one hand and shoves him back a step. Not a punch. A control move. The kind that says he’s done it before.

Rusk’s hand goes to his baton.

And the heavy man says, clear as day, loud enough for the shop: “Don’t. Guild business.”

The word lands like a weight. Rusk freezes for half a beat—long enough to tell you it means something.

In that half beat, wool-coat takes his chance. He pushes off the shelves and comes around the end of the counter, closing the gap toward you, hands still up but coming in like he means to steer you—hard—away from the clerk and toward the locked door.

Rusk turns sharply, baton half-drawn, caught between the “Guild business” in front of him and you about to be grabbed.

Concrete threat: **wool-coat is within arm’s reach and moving to put hands on you; the door is locked; Rusk is hesitating under pressure from the heavy man’s Guild claim.**

### Turn 34 [PLAYER]

I snatch the nearest lamp oil tin off the counter and hold it up between us like a weight, backing tight behind the counter edge. “Touch me and I smash this—on you, on the floor, on the lanterns. Whole shop goes up.”

I raise my voice to the room and Rusk. “Officer Rusk, I’m being detained in a locked shop. I want that door opened and I want these men searched—now.”

To wool-coat, low and hard: “One more step and you’re wearing oil.”

*Agent reasoning: If wool-coat gets hands on me, I’m done. I need space and leverage without escalating to a fight I can’t win. Creating a loud, unmistakable assault and forcing Rusk to act is my best shot, plus using the counter as a barrier and an improvised weapon if needed.*

### Turn 35 [GAME]

Your fingers clamp around a squat tin of lamp oil on the counter—cold metal, greasy label—and you bring it up fast like a fist with weight. Wool-coat checks himself mid-step. His hands stay up, but his eyes flick to the shop’s hanging lantern and the open flame behind the counter.

The clerk goes pale. “Don’t—” he starts, then swallows the rest. He slides his hands off the counter edge like he’s afraid you’ll splash him by accident.

“Everybody back from the lights,” the onion woman blurts, finally finding a voice. She tugs a kid by the sleeve away from the nearest lantern hook.

Officer Rusk’s baton comes fully free with a dry rasp. He points it, not at you—at wool-coat. “Stop right there.”

The heavy man by the door lifts both palms, slow, showing he’s not reaching for anything. “No one’s touching her,” he says, but his eyes are on the oil tin now, calculating.

Wool-coat lowers his voice, trying to sound reasonable while staying out of reach. “You smash that, you’ll burn alive in here with us.”

Rusk snaps, louder now, for the room to hear: “Unlock. The. Door.”

The heavy man hesitates—long enough to tell you he’s deciding whether Rusk is worth defying in public—then reaches back and slides the bolt open with a sharp *clack*. The front door is now **unlocked**.

Rusk immediately steps into the lane between you and wool-coat, baton out, and barks to the clerk without looking away from the two men: “You—go get another patrolman. Now. Run.”

The clerk doesn’t argue. He bolts for the back room curtain.

Wool-coat doesn’t advance, but he does angle his body toward the open doorway like he’s ready to slip out the second Rusk commits to either of them. The heavy man stays by the door, not blocking it anymore—just *occupying* it.

Threat is still live and specific: **the door is open, but both men are positioned to either rush you if you move past them or flee before backup arrives; Rusk is alone and has just escalated by calling for another unit.**

Keeping the oil tin raised, I edge sideways behind Rusk’s shoulder toward the open door. “Rusk—stay between me and them. I’m stepping out, and I’m not running.”

I cut my eyes to wool-coat. “Name. Now. Or I remember your face and you get to wonder when I say it to the wrong person.”

Then to the heavy man, voice sharp: “And you—‘Guild business’ isn’t a badge. Show me what you think protects you.”

*Agent reasoning: The door’s open but they’re poised to either grab me or vanish; I want out without turning my back, and I want something identifiable—names, details—before they bolt. I’ll use Rusk as a buffer and the oil tin as leverage, and try to force at least one to give a name or show a mark while I exit.*

### Turn 38 [PLAYER]

Keeping the oil tin up, I sidestep toward the doorway, staying tight behind Rusk’s shoulder. “Officer Rusk—escort me outside. If they follow, you’ll see it.”

Without taking my eyes off the heavy man, I say, “You said ‘Guild business.’ Show a mark, a writ—something. Otherwise step away from the door.”

*Agent reasoning: The door’s finally open, but these two are still positioned to either grab me or bolt. I want out into the street without turning my back, and I want Rusk committing—either he escorts me or he’s compromised. Pressing for names/credentials might rattle them, but leaving safely comes first.*

### Turn 39 [GAME]

Rusk shifts immediately, shoulder turning to give you a lane while keeping his baton and body between you and wool-coat. “Move,” he says, clipped. “Slow.”

You sidestep with the oil tin raised. The metal edge scrapes the counter as you clear it, and the lantern flame behind the clerk’s station wobbles from the draft of the now-open door.

Heavy man doesn’t step aside—but he does pivot, giving just enough space that you can pass without brushing him. It’s deliberate: close enough to touch, not close enough to be accused of grabbing.

You demand a mark or writ.

He answers by pulling his coat lapel open with two fingers and flashing what looks like a brass-and-enamel pin—anchor-and-gear motif—on the inside seam. Not a patrol badge. More like a membership mark. He keeps it visible for only a second.

“Harbor Authority,” he says. “Inspection authority. You don’t get to—”

Rusk cuts him off. “You’re not on my roster.” He jabs the baton toward the man’s chest without touching him. “And you’re not locking doors with civilians inside.”

Wool-coat uses the argument as cover: he slides sideways toward the doorway, trying to time it so he’s moving when Rusk’s eyes are on the heavy man. His hands stay up, but his feet are quick.

Rusk sees it late—half a heartbeat—and snaps, “Stay where you are!”

You and Rusk make it to the threshold. Rain air rushes in, cold and wet. Outside, the street is empty in the immediate splash of lamplight—except for a shape across the way under the awning: a man pretending to read a posted notice, head angled just enough to watch the door.

Behind you, the heavy man shifts his weight toward the jamb like he might “accidentally” close it again if Rusk steps fully out.

Concrete threat: **you can exit now, but if Rusk steps outside with you, the heavy man is positioned to swing the door shut and isolate you or Rusk; wool-coat is trying to slip out in the same moment; there’s at least one watcher across the street already set on the exit.**

### Turn 40 [PLAYER]

I stop on the threshold and don’t step into the rain yet. “Rusk—keep one foot in the door. Don’t let him close it.”

I lift the oil tin toward the watcher across the street, just enough to signal I’ve seen him. “You under the awning—stay right there. Officer’s watching.”

Then, to Rusk in a low voice: “Call his bluff. Ask for his Harbor Authority writ and name—out loud. And don’t let wool-coat slip past.”

*Agent reasoning: If I step out alone, I’m exposed to the watcher; if Rusk steps out, they can slam the door and split us. I need the door controlled and witnesses locked in place while we assess outside.*

### Turn 41 [GAME]

Rusk plants his boot hard against the threshold, toe hooked under the door edge so it can’t swing shut without taking his foot with it. “Try it,” he tells the heavy man, quiet but flat.

You angle the oil tin at the watcher under the awning.

The watcher doesn’t freeze. He folds the paper like he’s finished reading it, tucks it into his coat, and takes two unhurried steps away from the lamplight—toward the darker stretch between storefronts. Not running. Repositioning. His right hand stays in his pocket.

Inside, Rusk raises his voice so the whole shop hears. “Harbor Authority—name and writ. Out loud. Now.”

The heavy man’s jaw tightens. He pats his inner breast pocket with two fingers, like he’s reminding himself it’s there, but he doesn’t produce anything. “You don’t have jurisdiction—”

Rusk interrupts, louder. “Name.”

Wool-coat chooses that moment to move. He dips his shoulder and tries to slide past the heavy man and the jamb—aiming for the crack between Rusk’s planted foot and the doorframe.

Rusk reacts fast this time: baton swings down, not a strike—an abrupt block across the gap. Wood thunks. Wool-coat jerks back, but his sleeve catches the baton’s tip for an instant, tugging fabric.

Wool-coat’s hands drop from “surrender” to something else—fingers flexing like he’s about to shove through anyway.

The heavy man makes his play: he leans into Rusk’s planted leg, trying to force the door inward against the boot and pinch Rusk off balance. It’s not subtle. It’s a controlled crush.

Outside, the watcher under the awning turns his head toward the commotion and lifts his pocketed hand slightly—still concealed—like he’s waiting for a clean line or a signal.

**Immediate threat, clear:** the heavy man is trying to trap/torque Rusk’s leg in the door and knock him down; wool-coat is poised to rush the gap; the watcher outside is repositioning with a hidden hand in his pocket, likely armed or signaling.

### Turn 42 [PLAYER]

I slam the oil tin down hard onto the heavy man’s forearm/hand where he’s leaning into the door, using it like a club, then immediately hook my free hand into Rusk’s belt/coat and yank him backward off the threshold. 

As we move, I shout out into the street, “HELP—OFFICER UNDER ATTACK! Man outside with his hand in his pocket!” 

I back us into the shop’s open space, oil tin still up, and snap at Rusk: “Don’t let them split you from the door—call for that second patrolman again, loud.”

*Agent reasoning: Rusk’s about to get dropped and pinned in the doorway; if that happens, I’m trapped between three men. I need to break their leverage without starting a fire, and get us out into open space while calling attention to the watcher.*

### Turn 43 [GAME]

The oil tin comes down with a dull, ugly clang against the heavy man’s forearm where he’s braced into the jamb. Metal on bone. He grunts—more surprise than pain at first—then his hand spasms and slips off the door edge. The pressure against Rusk’s boot eases for a breath.

You seize Rusk by the belt/coat seam and haul.

Rusk stumbles backward into the shop, boot scraping free of the threshold just as the heavy man surges again. The door swings inward half a foot, then rebounds on its hinge—still open, but now uncontrolled.

Your shout knifes out into the rain: “HELP—OFFICER UNDER ATTACK! Man outside—hand in his pocket!”

Across the street, the watcher’s head snaps up. He doesn’t charge. He backs into the dark between storefronts and **pulls his hand free**—not a gun, but a small dark object that disappears into his other palm. A signal piece, or something he can ditch fast. He’s gone from view in two steps.

Inside, the clerk yelps and ducks behind the counter, knocking over a stack of receipts. Glass rattles.

Wool-coat takes the opening. He darts through the doorway into the rain, shoulder low, moving fast now that he’s committed. You catch a glimpse of his face in the streetlamp flare—thin mouth, eyes fixed ahead—and then he’s outside, angling hard left down the sidewalk.

The heavy man, forearm reddening where you struck him, doesn’t pursue immediately. Instead he swings his body into the doorway, blocking it again—this time from the inside—with his good arm spread against the frame like a brace. He’s breathing heavier, jaw set.

Rusk recovers his stance in the shop’s open space, baton up. He barks, loud enough to carry: “SECOND UNIT—NOW! Corner of—” He rattles off the street name like he’s spitting nails.

The heavy man answers Rusk directly, voice low and threatening: “You just made this a problem you can’t file.”

**Threat, concrete:** wool-coat has escaped into the street; the outside watcher has repositioned out of sight after signaling/handling a small object; the heavy man is now physically holding the doorway from inside, keeping you penned while his people move outside.

### Turn 44 [PLAYER]

I keep the oil tin up and back away from the doorway, putting a counter and a lantern’s radius between me and the heavy man. “Clerk—back door. Now. Is there a back exit or not?”

To Rusk, low: “Don’t let him bait you. Get his name and that pin—describe it for the report, out loud.” Then louder to the heavy man: “Step away from the door and show your writ. Full name. If you’re ‘Harbor Authority,’ you won’t mind it being said in front of witnesses.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re getting boxed in—door blocked from inside, at least two outside. I need to keep distance, create leverage, and get names/evidence while Rusk holds authority. Fire is a last resort but the oil gives me a deterrent; we should also use a back exit if there is one.*

### Turn 45 [GAME]

You backpedal with the oil tin up, keeping the counter between you and the doorway. The lantern throws a trembling circle of light across the floorboards; in it, the heavy man’s shadow stretches long and warped, one arm still braced on the frame.

The clerk pops up just enough to answer, eyes wide. “Back—” He swallows. “No back door. Just the delivery hatch to the alley, but it’s— it’s chained from outside.” He points with a shaking finger toward a metal hatch behind the counter, half-hidden by stacked crates.

Rusk takes your cue. He doesn’t advance. He squares his shoulders and raises his voice like he’s reading into a recorder. “Subject presenting as Harbor Authority. Anchor-and-gear pin, brass with enamel—worn inside coat seam. Refuses to produce writ. Refuses name.”

The heavy man’s mouth twitches—almost a smile, but it doesn’t reach his eyes. “Write whatever bedtime story you like, officer.”

Lena, when you demand the writ and name, he finally shifts—but not back. He slides his bracing arm away from the frame and turns his body sideways, freeing one hand to reach into his coat.

For a second it looks like compliance.

Then he produces a folded paper—too fast, too casual—and holds it up just inside the doorway where the rainlight can’t hit it clean. No seal visible at this distance. No clear letterhead. He doesn’t hand it over.

“Writ,” he says. “Satisfied?”

Rusk steps half a pace to get an angle. The heavy man snaps the paper back before Rusk can read more than a line. “You don’t touch it.”

At the same time, from outside in the rain, you hear quick footfalls and a low call—two voices, not shouted, coordinating. Not patrol cadence. Dockside.

The heavy man glances past you toward the chained hatch behind the counter, like he’s checking that route is still shut. Then he lifts his chin at Rusk. “Your second unit won’t come. Not tonight.”

**Threat, clear:** there are at least two additional men closing outside; the alley hatch is chained from the outside; the heavy man is controlling the doorway and flashing a possibly fake writ without letting it be examined—stalling while help arrives for him, not you.

### Turn 46 [PLAYER]

I nod toward the hatch and whisper to the clerk, “Get me something heavy—crowbar, hammer, anything—and put that lantern near the hatch. Quiet.”

To Rusk, low and fast: “They’ve got the alley. Don’t chase—hold center and keep your whistle ready. On my count, we make noise and push the door wide, not out—just wide enough to see who’s out there.”

I raise my voice at the heavy man, buying seconds: “Read it. Out loud. Full text—date, issuing office, and your full name. If it’s real, you won’t be afraid of witnesses.”

Then I call toward the hatch, loud enough to carry: “Whoever’s in the alley—chain comes off now, or when we open this door the whole street hears what you’re doing to an officer.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re being boxed in and the “writ” is a stall while more men arrive. We need information, leverage, and an exit—preferably without getting Rusk isolated. The hatch being chained from outside suggests someone’s already in the alley; we should confirm and force noise/attention while preparing a break-out.*

### Turn 47 [GAME]

The clerk nods hard, lips pressed white, and drops out of sight behind the counter. You hear frantic rummaging—wood scraping, a drawer yanked open and shut too fast. He slides the lantern off its hook and sets it on the floor near the hatch, turning the wick down until it’s a low, steady glow. Then he comes up with a short iron pry bar—more nail-puller than crowbar—but heavy enough to crack knuckles. He holds it out handle-first, shaking.

Rusk leans in to answer you—and at the word **“whistle”** his hand pats his coat pocket on reflex.

The heavy man sees it too.

He snaps, “Don’t,” and his free hand drops to his own waistband under the coat.

Your demand—“Read it out loud”—lands. The heavy man’s eyes flick to the clerk, to the hatch, to the shop windows. He doesn’t read. He folds the paper tighter, like it was never meant to be heard. “You want words,” he says, “here’s one: *leave*.”

Then your call toward the alley: “Chain comes off now—”

From behind the hatch, iron answers iron: the chain gives a short, testing rattle, like someone tugged it once and stopped. A voice—male, close, amused—comes through the seams. “Wrong door, sweetheart.”

Outside the front, the two quiet voices you heard earlier get closer—boots on wet stone, then a pause right beyond the threshold as if they’re taking positions out of your lantern line.

The heavy man shifts his stance and **kicks the door inward**—not to close it, but to swing it wider and clear his own space. Rain blows in. Streetlamp light spills across the entry.

You get a clean slice of what’s there: two Harbor “safety men” in oilskins step out from the building’s edge, batons low and a wrapped hook-knife hanging from one wrist. They don’t rush; they fan slightly to either side of the doorway, cutting angles.

“Officer,” one of them calls, voice polite as paperwork, “you’re done here.”

**Threat, immediate:** three men at the front (heavy man inside controlling the threshold; two armed “safety men” outside), and at least one man in the alley holding the hatch chain. Your exits are effectively covered; the shop is now your only space.

And Rusk’s whistle—if it comes out—will carry.

### Turn 48 [PLAYER]

I take the pry bar from the clerk and back up to keep the counter between us and the doorway, bar up and ready but not swinging yet. “Rusk—WHISTLE. Now!”  

Then I raise my voice toward the street: “These men are impersonating Harbor Authority and threatening an officer—someone go get patrol, right now!”  

To the heavy man, steady: “Nobody touches that officer. You want us to ‘leave,’ you step back and let us walk out together—slow—hands where I can see them.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re boxed in and outnumbered; the safest leverage is visibility and noise. I want Rusk to signal for help while I keep distance, put obstacles between us and them, and avoid getting isolated near the hatch or the door.*

### Turn 49 [GAME]

The pry bar’s cold weight settles into your hand. You back until the counter’s corner is between you and the doorway, giving yourself a hard edge and a narrow lane.

Rusk doesn’t hesitate. He brings the whistle up and **blasts** it—sharp, piercing, the kind of sound that makes teeth itch.

Outside, the two oilskin men flinch and then move anyway. One steps to the doorframe and **hooks a gloved hand around the edge**, steadying it; the other shifts out into the street, head turning, scanning for who’s watching.

Your shout—“Impersonating Harbor Authority—get patrol!”—carries into the rain.

You get an answer, but not the one you want: a window across the street snaps open a few inches, a face appears for half a second, then the sash drops closed like it burned them. A couple under an awning pretends they didn’t hear, shoulders hunched, walking faster. People are nearby, but nobody wants to be a witness in this neighborhood.

The heavy man’s eyes harden at the whistle. He doesn’t step back. He **steps in**, one pace over the threshold line, keeping his body between Rusk and the oilskins like he’s corralling you. His hand comes up, palm out—not surrender, command.

“Officer’s making a disturbance,” he calls to the street, loud enough to overwrite your narrative. “We’re escorting him out.”

Then, quieter to his men but clear in the lantern spill: “Take the whistle.”

One oilskin man lunges for Rusk—not a tackle, a practiced snatch—arm shooting in to grab Rusk’s coat front and the hand with the whistle. Rusk jerks back, baton half-raised, but he’s off-balance from the counter and the sudden reach.

At the same time, from the alley hatch behind you: **the chain rattles again**, longer this time, and you hear metal scrape like someone is testing the padlock with a tool. Whoever’s back there is working the chain—either to open it or to make sure it stays shut.

**Threat, immediate and specific:** an oilskin “safety man” is actively trying to seize Rusk’s whistle and control him; the heavy man is advancing to herd you; someone in the alley is manipulating the chained hatch, potentially changing your only alternate exit in seconds.

### Turn 50 [PLAYER]

I step in and slam the pry bar down onto the oilskin man’s forearm/wrist as he grabs for Rusk—hard enough to make him let go—then hook my other hand into Rusk’s sleeve and yank him back behind the counter with me. 

“Rusk, keep that whistle in your mouth and back up—don’t let them take your hands,” I hiss. Then louder, to the doorway: “Touch him again and I start breaking fingers—back out of this shop!” 

I glance over my shoulder at the hatch and call to the alley, sharp: “Clerk—get me whatever cuts chain. Now. And you out there—show your face or you’re getting a lantern full of oil.”

*Agent reasoning: Rusk losing the whistle and getting grabbed is the fastest way we get controlled; I need to break that grab without escalating to lethal force. Also the hatch being worked means our rear could open—or get sealed—so I should keep it in sight and use the counter as cover while we reposition.*

### Turn 51 [GAME]

You step in fast and bring the pry bar down.

It lands with a wet, ugly *thunk* on the oilskin man’s forearm right as his fingers close on Rusk’s coat. He yelps and his grip pops open. The whistle shrieks again—continuous, panicked, but still sounding.

The oilskin man staggers back a half-step, clutching his arm. “Bitch—!” he spits, pain turning his voice thin. His baton comes up, not swinging yet, but ready.

You hook Rusk by the sleeve and haul him back behind the counter. He stumbles, catches himself on the wood, and keeps the whistle between his teeth like you told him—eyes watering, breathing hard through his nose.

Your warning—breaking fingers—gets a reaction: the heavy man stops advancing. Not because he’s scared of the threat, but because he’s calculating.

He points at you with the folded “writ” like it’s a badge. “Assaulting a safety inspector. Officer inciting. Witnesses heard it.” He says it loudly, for the street.

Then he gives a small, sharp gesture with two fingers.

The uninjured oilskin man moves to the doorframe and **yanks the shop door wider**, clearing space. The injured one squares up, baton up, and starts to come in—angling for the narrow opening at the end of the counter, the way you’d come around to reach the register.

Behind you, the hatch chain gives a final rattle—then a different sound: **metal biting metal**, like bolt cutters closing. The padlock doesn’t snap, but it *screams* under pressure. Whoever’s in the alley is trying to force it.

The clerk, pale and sweating, scrabbles under the counter. “I— I got a cleaver!” he blurts, producing a butcher’s cleaver from a drawer like it’s a prayer. Not chain-cutters. Not a file. Just kitchen steel.

And the heavy man’s hand finally comes out from under his coat holding something dark and compact—**a pistol**, low at his thigh, not yet raised. His voice drops, meant only for you and Rusk.

“Whistle stops,” he says. “Or the officer does.”

**Threats now:** baton-man pushing into the shop from the counter end; alley-man actively trying to cut the hatch lock; heavy man has a gun and is prepared to use it to end the whistle.

### Turn 52 [PLAYER]

“Rusk—DOWN. Behind the counter, now!” I shove him low and duck with him, keeping the counter between us and that pistol.

To the clerk, urgent and low: “Kill the lantern—now. And get behind me.”

I yank the oil tin up and hurl it hard toward the doorway at chest height—not to hit, to make them flinch and block their view—then, from cover, I snap, “You fire in here and the whole block hears it—patrol’s already coming. Back off!”

*Agent reasoning: Gun changes the math—keeping the whistle going risks Rusk getting shot. We need cover, break their line of sight, and create a chance to escape through the hatch if it opens. I’ll force Rusk down, use the counter as hard cover, and use noise/light to disrupt their push without giving the gunman a clean shot.*

### Turn 53 [GAME]

Rusk drops when you shove him—hard. His shoulder knocks the counter leg and he goes down behind the wood with a grunt, whistle still in his mouth. The sound turns muffled but doesn’t stop; it becomes a steady, ugly bleat under the counter like an alarm trapped in a box.

The clerk fumbles for the lantern. His fingers are slick with sweat; he gets the chimney, twists the wick down too far, and the flame gutters—then dies. The shop goes dim fast, lit only by rain-blue spill from the doorway and a thin band of streetlamp. The counter becomes real cover now, but so does every shadow.

You snatch the oil tin and throw.

It sails chest-high and the uninjured oilskin man jerks back on instinct, forearms up. The heavy man flinches too—his pistol hand dips as he turns his shoulder. The tin clips the doorframe with a ringing *clang* and tumbles into the threshold area, dented, skittering in a slick half-circle on wet boards.

The baton-man who’d started to come around the counter checks his step to avoid it—just a heartbeat of hesitation, but it’s there.

Then the heavy man recovers. He doesn’t fire blind. He **steps sideways out of the doorway line** to get an angle around the counter, keeping most of his body behind the doorframe while the pistol comes up to a low-ready, pointed toward where your head would be if you popped up.

“Patrol?” he says, voice flat. “Then you’ve got about ten seconds to decide how brave you are.”

Outside, one of the oilskins barks a short whistle of his own—two quick notes—toward the street. It’s not a police whistle; it’s a signal.

From the alley hatch behind you: the padlock finally gives with a sharp metallic *crack*. The chain slackens and drops against the wood.

A hand appears through the hatch seam, fingers pale in the dark, and the hatch **lifts a fraction**—not open yet, but no longer secured. A man’s voice, close and amused, threads into the shop from behind the counter line:

“Lights out. That’s better.”

You’re now boxed: gun angle from the doorframe, baton and bodies at the threshold, and the rear hatch is actively being opened from the alley side.

### Turn 54 [PLAYER]

I keep low and grab the clerk by the sleeve, yanking him down behind the counter with us. To Rusk, a harsh whisper: “Keep that whistle going—don’t stop.”  

I crawl fast along the inside of the counter toward the hatch and jam the pry bar into the hatch gap/hinge line, trying to lever it shut or pin it so it can’t lift. Then I hiss toward the voice in the alley, “Come through and you’re coming in blind—last chance to back off.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re boxed with a gun at the front and a breach at the back; staying static gets us picked off. Darkness is our only advantage—use it to deny the gunman a clean shot and block the hatch before it opens fully. Also keep the whistle going to draw help.*

### Turn 55 [GAME]

You yank the clerk down. He comes easy—almost collapses—ending up wedged beside Rusk behind the counter, cleaver clutched to his chest like it might stop a bullet. Rusk keeps the whistle going; it’s wet and ragged now, but continuous.

You crab-walk along the counter’s inside, keeping your head below the lip. The hatch is right there—boards dark with rain seep and alley grime. It’s lifted a few inches now, enough for fingers and a forearm.

You slam the pry bar into the gap and torque it.

For a second it works: the hatch grinds down and the unseen man’s fingers lose purchase. You feel the bar bite wood. You pin it hard enough that the hatch can’t rise cleanly.

Then pressure comes from the other side—steady, deliberate. Whoever’s out there isn’t just lifting; he’s **prying back** with something long. The hatch bucks against your bar. The wood flexes, and a screw near the hinge line squeals, starting to pull.

The voice in the alley answers, closer now, all calm: “Blind’s fine. I know this shop.”

A thin blade of streetlight cuts through as the hatch is forced up again—only an inch, but enough.

Something cold and metallic snakes through the gap from the alley side: the hooked end of a **crowbar or gaff**, reaching for *your* pry bar to snag it and rip it out of your hands.

At the front, the heavy man calls low, controlled: “He’s at the back. Now.”

Boots thump on the boards—one of the oilskins commits inside, moving fast around the counter’s open end. The baton taps once against wood as he uses it to feel his way in the dim.

You’re holding the hatch down with your pry bar, but you’re now in an active tug-of-war through a gap that’s widening—and a baton-man is closing from the shop side while a gun stays angled from the doorway.

**Immediate threats:** the alley man is trying to hook and yank your pry bar (and your hands with it) through the hatch gap; the hatch hinge hardware is starting to give; an oilskin with a baton is moving to flank you behind the counter.

### Turn 56 [PLAYER]

I let the pry bar go the instant the hook catches, then stomp the hatch down with my heel and drive the cleaver handle-first into the gap toward the reaching hand, aiming to smash fingers. “Rusk—keep screaming that whistle. Clerk—stay down!”

I scramble back along the counter toward the open end, keeping low, and shout toward the doorway, “He’s breaking in through the hatch—gunman, you fire and everyone hears it!”

*Agent reasoning: I’m about to get flanked and disarmed; holding the pry bar is turning into a trap. Better to deny them a clean grab and buy seconds—hurt the hand at the hatch, then reposition to protect Rusk and force them into a worse angle.*

### Turn 57 [GAME]

The hook catches your pry bar with a hard *clink* and you instantly let go.

The alley man yanks—expecting resistance—and the bar whips out through the gap so fast it scrapes wood and throws a splintery squeal. Your heel comes down on the hatch in the same beat. The hatch slams flat with a hollow *WHUMP*, catching whatever was still reaching through.

You snatch the cleaver from the clerk’s death-grip as you move—he doesn’t even protest, just makes a small strangled sound—and you drive the **handle** down into the seam like a hammer.

There’s a sharp, human yelp from the alley side. Then a string of breathy curses. Fingers recoil. Something metal clatters against the outside boards like it got dropped or bumped.

But the hatch doesn’t stay quiet. Immediately, weight hits it from the alley—shoulder or boot—testing it. The hinge line, already stressed, gives a tiny *tick* as a fastener shifts.

You scramble back along the counter, low, and shout your warning toward the doorway.

The heavy man answers by doing the one thing you can’t argue with: he fires **once**—not into the room, but into the ceiling near the door. The shot cracks the shop open like a thunderclap. Plaster dust rains down in a chalky sheet. The clerk screams despite himself. Rusk’s whistle stutters for half a breath, then continues, frantic.

“Now everyone heard it,” the heavy man says, voice raised over the ringing in your ears. “So stop making noise.”

The baton-man who’d come inside uses the gunshot as cover for movement. He’s at the counter’s open end now, just a few strides away in the dim, baton out and ready. “Marrow,” he spits—he knows your name—“come out.”

Behind you, the hatch takes another shove from the alley side—harder. The boards bow a fraction. Whoever’s out there has decided pain isn’t a reason to leave.

**What’s in front of you:** baton-man closing at the counter end; heavy man with a pistol posted at the doorway, now willing to shoot; hatch behind you being forced again, hinge hardware weakening.

### Turn 58 [PLAYER]

I stay low and slide a stack of tins off the counter edge toward the baton-man’s feet to foul his approach, then pop up just enough to fling the cleaver (handle-first) at his face to make him flinch and cover.  

“Rusk—MOVE, now! Crawl for the door on my count—clerk with him!” I bark, then to the gunman, loud: “You know my name—so you know I don’t go quiet. Patrol’s coming either way.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re getting boxed in from three angles; staying here means we lose. The whistle is our only leverage—keep it going—while I try to break their coordination and create a path out, preferably through the front before the hatch gives. A sudden attack on the baton-man could buy seconds without exposing myself to the gun for long.*

### Turn 59 [GAME]

You sweep your arm along the counter lip and a stack of tins—sardines, beans, something in paper sleeves—goes over the edge in a clattering spill.

They hit the floor between you and the baton-man. Two tins roll fast on the damp boards; one pops its lid halfway and skates like a wheel. The baton-man’s boot lands on a rolling tin and his ankle buckles. He catches himself with a hard baton tap on the counter edge, but his forward momentum dies. He’s forced to widen his stance and look down for half a second.

You rise just enough to throw.

The cleaver goes handle-first like you intended, but the throw’s cramped—counter, low ceiling, adrenaline. It doesn’t fly clean. The baton-man snaps his forearm up and the handle **smacks** into his guard with a dull thud, still enough to make him flinch back and cover his face.

But you’ve shown your head.

The heavy man at the doorway fires immediately—not a warning this time. The shot chews a chunk out of the counter’s top edge inches from where you were, spraying wood splinters and powdered laminate across your cheek and into your hair. The bullet’s crack is followed by the clerk’s sobbing inhale and Rusk’s whistle turning into a ragged, panicked trill.

“Count on it,” the heavy man barks, and shifts his aim lower, tracking the counter line. He’s not trying to kill everyone—he’s trying to pin you.

Rusk and the clerk start to move when you shout, but it’s ugly: the clerk crawls first, scrambling on hands and knees toward the door end; Rusk drags himself after, one arm clutched to his shoulder, whistle still in his mouth. They’re exposed for moments as they pass the open end of the counter.

The baton-man—recovering—kicks a tin away and lunges to intercept them, baton raised to crack down on the crawling clerk.

Behind you, the hatch finally gives with a tearing *rip*—a hinge screw pulls free. The hatch lifts a handspan and cold air knifes in. A pale hand, knuckles reddened, shoves through, feeling for purchase on the floorboards.

**Threats, now:** gunman firing to pin you; baton-man about to strike the crawling clerk (and Rusk right behind him); hatch opening behind you with an intruder’s hand already inside.

### Turn 60 [PLAYER]

I lunge low and hook my leg out, kicking the rolling tins straight into the baton-man’s shins to spoil his swing, then grab the counter edge and shove hard to topple more stock down into his path.  

“Rusk—keep crawling, don’t look back!” I snap, then reach back and stomp the hatch hand with my heel, trying to pin it while I drag myself after them toward the door-side cover.

*Agent reasoning: The baton-man is the immediate threat to Rusk and the clerk; the gunman is pinning me, so I need a low, close intervention that doesn’t expose my head. The hatch hand is dangerous but secondary for the next second—buy time by jamming it after I stop the strike.*

### Turn 61 [GAME]

Your foot snaps out and the tins you’d spilled become ammunition. Two catch the baton-man in the shins with hollow *thunks*. He hisses, his swing stutters mid-arc, and the baton clips the counter edge instead of the clerk’s spine—close enough to make the clerk yelp and scramble faster, but it doesn’t land clean.

You grab the counter and heave. A row of boxed goods and glass jars topples off in a dirty cascade. One jar bursts on the floor with a wet crack—pickled something—spreading slick brine across the boards right where the baton-man needs to step. He checks himself again, forced to hop to keep his footing, and for a heartbeat he’s more worried about falling than advancing.

Rusk keeps crawling, whistle still screaming; his free hand claws at the floorboards, dragging him past the counter’s open end. The clerk, wide-eyed and shaking, gets a shoulder against a low shelf near the doorway—partial cover.

You reach back and stomp.

Your heel comes down on the pale hand pushing through the hatch gap. You feel bones shift under your boot. The intruder yowls—high and furious—and tries to yank free.

He doesn’t. Not immediately.

But the hatch is up enough now that he can use his other arm and tool leverage from outside. The torn hinge side flexes again. Your weight pins the hand, but the whole hatch begins to **lift around** your boot, prying up like a jaw.

At the doorway, the heavy man shifts his aim to the crawling bodies and barks, “Don’t let ’em out!”

He fires again—low. The shot punches into the floorboards near Rusk’s trailing leg, splintering wood and making Rusk flinch so hard his whistle cuts out into a gagging cough.

The baton-man, seeing the opening, commits: he slides one boot through the brine and comes in anyway, baton raised again—this time not for the clerk, but angling toward **you**, over the counter line.

Behind you, the pinned hand twists, and you feel something sharp scrape your boot sole—like a small blade or hook trying to cut leather or catch an ankle.

**Immediate threats:** baton-man closing to strike you; gunman now shooting to stop escape; hatch lifting under you while the intruder works a sharp tool against your boot/ankle to break your pin.

### Turn 62 [PLAYER]

I yank my foot off the hatch before the blade catches, then kick the brine-slick jar shards and a tin toward the baton-man’s lead foot to make him slip. I drop low and scramble hard toward the door-side shelving where the clerk’s crouched, hissing, “Rusk—OUT, now! Clerk—stay tight to the shelf!” and shout at the gunman, “You shoot again and you’re explaining it to the patrol yourself!”

*Agent reasoning: I’m about to get boxed in—baton in front, gun at the door, blade at my ankle. I need to break contact and get mobile; keeping my foot pinned risks getting cut or dragged through the hatch. I’ll use the slick brine and clutter to trip the baton-man, then retreat to door-side cover while warning Rusk/clerk.*

### Turn 63 [GAME]

You pull your foot back just as the hatch jerks upward again. Something sharp flashes in the gap—short blade or hook—missing your boot by inches. The pale hand disappears, then reappears higher, gripping the hatch edge with fresh determination.

You snap a tin and a spray of glass shards forward with your toe.

The baton-man’s lead foot comes down half on brine, half on rolling metal. His boot skates. He windmills his free arm, baton sweeping wide and ugly. He doesn’t go fully down, but he *loses the line*—his swing turns into a stumble-step, his shoulder slamming the counter corner with a solid *thud*. He swears and has to catch himself, buying you the heartbeat you needed.

You drop and scramble for the door-side shelving.

The heavy man tracks you with the pistol, jaw tight. Your shout about patrol makes his eyes flick, just once, toward the street—like he’s listening past the rain for sirens that aren’t there yet.

He fires anyway.

Not at you—at the shelving. The round punches through the lower boards with a splintering crack, sending a burst of sawdust and woodchips across the clerk’s hands. The clerk shrieks and presses flatter to the shelf, shaking hard, but he stays put like you told him.

Rusk lurches up from his crawl into a half-crouch and stumbles for the door, favoring his shoulder. He gets one foot over the threshold—

—and the heavy man lunges and **kicks the door inward** against him. The door slams into Rusk’s hip and thigh, folding him sideways into the jamb. Rusk grunts, wind knocked out, whistle clattering out of his mouth and skittering across the floor.

“Out?” the heavy man says, voice low and mean. “Not tonight.”

Behind you, the hatch lifts higher with a tearing squeal. An arm and shoulder force through now—oilskin sleeve, wet to the elbow. Whoever it is has leverage and they’re coming in fast, blade-hand still low.

**What’s happening now:** Rusk is pinned at the doorway by the gunman and the door; the clerk is in cover but terrified; baton-man is recovering from the slip and reorienting on you; the hatch intruder is halfway in with a small blade/hook and closing.

### Turn 64 [PLAYER]

I snatch up the skittered whistle and fling it hard toward the back/hatch to draw eyes, then I grab a tin and whip it at the gunman’s face to make him flinch. “Rusk—DROP and roll out when he blinks!” I shout, then I hook an arm under Rusk’s shoulder and yank him down and away from the jamb, trying to drag him behind the shelf line.

*Agent reasoning: We’re getting boxed in from two sides; the door is the only exit but it’s controlled. I need to create a distraction and buy seconds—get the gunman’s attention off Rusk, and keep distance from the hatch intruder’s blade without committing to a close fight.*

### Turn 65 [GAME]

You snatch the whistle off the boards—cold metal, slick with rainwater and spit—and whip it toward the back.

It clatters off the hatch edge with a sharp, bright *ting-ting-ting* that cuts through the gunfire noise like a signal. The oilskin-sleeved intruder flinches and turns his head toward it on instinct, shoulders twisting as he hauls himself in.

You grab a tin and throw it at the gunman.

It hits him high—cheekbone/eye line—with a dull *whomp*. He jerks back, one hand snapping up to his face. The pistol dips. He doesn’t drop it, but his stance breaks and his next shot doesn’t come.

“Bast—” he starts, muffled behind his palm.

“Rusk—DROP—” you shout, and you’re already moving.

You hook under Rusk’s good side and yank him down. He goes with it, more collapse than roll, and you drag him off the jamb line toward the shelving. His boots scrape furrows in spilled brine and grit. He’s heavy and half-stunned; his injured shoulder makes him gasp through clenched teeth.

The door swings wider as his weight leaves it.

The gunman recovers fast—too fast. He shoves the door with his boot to close the gap again and snaps the pistol down toward the floor line where you’re hauling Rusk.

The shot cracks and bites into the boards just behind your dragging hand, sending a splinter into your knuckles. Not a clean hit, but close enough you feel the sting and warmth.

The baton-man, seeing you committed to Rusk, surges around the counter end. He raises the baton two-handed, aiming for the back of your skull/shoulder as you crouch-drag.

From the back, the hatch intruder commits fully: he slides in on his belly, oilskins squealing on wood, and reaches forward with the small hook-blade toward your ankle—going low, trying to catch you while you’re pinned to Rusk.

Rusk is now partly behind the shelf line with you, but you’re exposed on three sides:
- gunman has a clear low-angle shot lane again,
- baton-man is a step away with the baton coming down,
- intruder is inside, blade reaching for your leg.

### Turn 66 [PLAYER]

I let go of Rusk and shove him fully behind the shelving, then I drop flat and roll under the lowest shelf board, yanking my legs in so the hook-blade misses. “Clerk—stay down and don’t move!” I hiss, then grab for anything heavy under the shelf to throw at the baton-man’s knees as he swings.

*Agent reasoning: I’m seconds from getting cracked in the head or hooked in the ankle; I need to break their timing and get real cover. The shelf is my only hard barrier—get behind it and force them to come to me.*

### Turn 67 [GAME]

You shove Rusk hard. He slides the last couple feet on his side and thumps into the shadow behind the shelving, out of the gunman’s clean line. He curls instinctively, one arm over his head, breathing ragged.

You go flat.

The hook-blade snaps through the space where your ankle was a moment ago and catches only air and the edge of a floorboard. The intruder’s arm jerks, frustrated, and the blade scrapes wood with a tearing squeal.

You roll under the lowest shelf board—tight, dusty, smelling of old grain and leaking brine—and yank your legs in. The clerk is right above you on the other side of the shelf supports, whimpering, hands clamped over his mouth. At your hiss he nods violently without making a sound.

The baton-man’s swing comes down where you’d been.

The baton smashes the floor with a crack that stings your ears under the shelf. He loses balance for a half-step, then drops his stance and jabs the baton low, trying to spear it under the shelf to catch you.

Your hand finds something heavy under there: a squat iron weight—probably a doorstop or scale weight—cold and greasy with dust.

You throw it blind toward his knees.

It hits. A solid *clang* against shinbone. The baton-man barks in pain and his probing jab falters, baton scraping along the shelf edge instead of driving in.

But the move costs you: the gunman, seeing you vanish under the shelf, lowers his aim and fires into the baseboard line anyway. The shot punches through the shelving upright with a sharp *whack*, showering you with splinters and dust. The round doesn’t hit you, but it chews away cover—there’s now a ragged hole at floor level with daylight-gray rainlight bleeding through it.

From the back, the oilskin intruder crawls closer on elbows, blade hand feeling along the floor for you. He can’t see you well, but he’s close enough that his wet sleeve brushes the shelf’s bottom edge.

The baton-man shifts tactics: limping, he plants a boot and starts to squat, reaching for the shelf frame like he means to **tip it** or rip it aside.

**Threats now:** gunman is shooting through the shelf base; intruder is within arm’s reach, probing with the hook-blade; baton-man is about to overturn or drag the shelving to expose you, Rusk, and the clerk.

### Turn 68 [PLAYER]

“Rusk—stay flat. Clerk—hands over your head.” I hiss, then kick my feet hard against the shelf’s base supports to buck it back as the baton-man tries to tip it. 

With my free hand I snatch up anything loose under here (cans, a bottle, whatever) and shove it through the splinter-hole toward the gunman’s line to spoil his aim, then I reach out low and slash/grab for the baton-man’s ankle to pull his footing out from under him while he’s mid-lift.

*Agent reasoning: If he tips the shelf, we’re dead in the open. I need to stop the lift, jam the structure, and create a distraction/escape route without exposing us to the gunman’s line.*

### Turn 69 [GAME]

“Rusk—stay flat. Clerk—hands over your head.”

Rusk makes a tight, pained sound but he stays curled behind the shelving. The clerk’s hands come up over his skull, elbows tucked, eyes squeezed shut like he’s waiting for the shelf to fall on him.

The baton-man gets his fingers under the shelf frame and heaves.

You kick hard against the base supports from underneath. The whole unit bucks—wood groans, nails squeal. It doesn’t tip over onto you, but it **slams back down** on his hands and shins. He yelps and hops a half-step, losing his leverage. The shelf stays upright.

Under the shelf your hand finds loose stock: two dented cans and a glass bottle on its side.

You shove them through the ragged bullet-hole toward the gunman’s lane. The bottle goes first, skittering and then **shattering** near the doorway in a wet crackle. The cans roll after it, clanging loud and erratic.

The gunman flinches and shifts his feet to avoid the glass. His pistol tracks down and left—his sightline spoiled for a moment—but he doesn’t stop shooting. He fires again, lower and tighter, aiming through the same weakened upright.

The round punches through and **clips you**: a hot, tearing graze along your upper arm/shoulder as splinters and fabric burst. Not a disabling hit, but it bleeds immediately, warm and fast.

You reach out low for the baton-man’s ankle as he tries to reset his grip.

Your fingers catch boot leather and you yank. He’s already off-balance from the buck; your pull finishes it. His foot slides on brine and shattered grain, and he goes down hard on his hip with a hollow *thud*, baton clattering out of his hand and spinning under the counter.

He snarls, scrambling for the baton with one hand and for you with the other.

At the same time the oilskin intruder commits: the hook-blade darts under the shelf toward the movement of your arm. It catches your sleeve and **tugs**, trying to drag you out by the arm you just used. You feel the blade bite cloth; if you jerk wrong it’ll bite skin.

The gunman, now angry and half-blinded by pain and glass, barks: “Tip it! Tip the damn shelf!”

And you hear it—outside, faint but real through the rain: a patrol whistle answering somewhere down the block. Not close yet, but coming.

**Immediate threats:** you’re bleeding from a graze; the intruder has your sleeve with the hook-blade and is pulling; baton-man is down but reaching; gunman still has a shot lane through the torn shelving and is trying to force the shelf to be moved.

### Turn 70 [PLAYER]

I go still for half a beat, then twist my arm to slacken the fabric and yank backward hard, ripping my sleeve free from the hook-blade even if it tears—anything to keep skin off that edge. 

“PATROL’S COMING!” I shout toward the front, loud enough for the street, then hiss to Rusk, “When they hesitate—crawl for the door, stay low.” I grab the nearest loose can and ram/throw it point-first at the intruder’s reaching hand under the shelf, trying to make him recoil and buy us room.

*Agent reasoning: I’m pinned and bleeding; if I fight the hook-blade wrong I’ll get sliced and dragged out into the gunman’s lane. Better to sacrifice the sleeve, create distance, and use the incoming patrol whistle as leverage to force a retreat while keeping Rusk and the clerk covered.*

### Turn 71 [GAME]

You freeze for a half-beat—just long enough to feel the hook-blade’s tension on your sleeve—then twist your arm inward to slack the cloth and yank back hard.

The fabric tears with a ripping *rrrk*. You come free.

The hook-blade doesn’t bite your skin, but the sudden pull makes your grazed shoulder flare; blood smears along the torn seam and down your forearm. The intruder’s hand jerks forward as the resistance vanishes, knuckles smacking the floorboards.

“PATROL’S COMING!” you yell toward the front, voice bouncing off the tin ceiling and out the broken doorway gap.

Outside, the rain eats some of it—but not all. You hear a muffled shout from the street in answer, then hurried footsteps splashing closer. Not right on top of you yet, but no longer hypothetical.

Inside, the gunman snaps his head toward the street sound. “Shit—” He shifts position, angling his body to keep the door and the shelf both in view. The pistol stays up, but his confidence cracks; he’s thinking about exits now.

You hiss to Rusk, “When they hesitate—crawl for the door, stay low.”

Rusk gives a tight nod you can barely see behind the shelving, jaw clenched hard enough to show white.

You grab the nearest loose can—heavy, sealed—and drive it point-first under the shelf toward the oilskin intruder’s reaching hand.

It hits his fingers with a sharp *clang* and a wet curse. He recoils on instinct, hand snapping back. The hook-blade scrapes the floor as he retreats a foot, shaking his hand like it’s gone numb.

That buys you a sliver of space—but it also gives him an idea. He jams the hook-blade into the shelf’s bottom edge and **starts sawing at the wood**, trying to widen the gap and get purchase to drag you out properly.

The baton-man, still on the floor near the counter, finds his baton with his fingertips and drags it back toward him. He’s breathing hard, pain-rage in his voice: “Got her under there.”

The gunman barks, louder now, toward the back: “Two minutes. Then we’re gone.”

And from outside—closer—another whistle blast cuts through the rain, accompanied by a voice: “Harbor Patrol! In there—hands where I can see ’em!”

They’re arriving at the front, but you’re still under the shelf with an intruder cutting at your cover, a baton-man rearming, and a gunman who may decide to shoot first and run.

### Turn 72 [PLAYER]

I shout toward the door, “PATROL—GUN! He’s got a pistol by the entrance!” Then I wriggle backward under the shelf toward Rusk’s side, keeping my head low, and kick out at the intruder’s blade-hand whenever it comes close. “Rusk, on my pull—crawl!” I grab Rusk’s belt/coat and start dragging him a few inches at a time toward the doorway side, staying in cover.

*Agent reasoning: Patrol arriving is our leverage; I want them seeing the gun first. But I can’t get trapped under the shelf if the intruder opens it up, so I need to shift position and keep the gunman from firing at the officers.*

### Turn 73 [GAME]

“PATROL—GUN! He’s got a pistol by the entrance!”

Your voice punches out into the rain. There’s a half-beat of silence, then the patrolman outside barks back, closer and sharper: “DROP IT! NOW!”

The gunman doesn’t drop anything. Boots scuff on glass. He shifts to use the doorframe as cover—then fires toward the voice outside.

The shot cracks like a snapped mast. You hear a grunt and a scrape as someone outside hits the wall or crouches hard. The patrolman answers instantly: “GUN—GUN—” and you hear his whistle again, urgent, a different cadence—calling backup.

Inside, the gunman retreats a step deeper into the shop, trying to keep sightlines while not being a silhouette in the doorway. He’s still armed and still shooting-capable, but he’s now pinned between the patrol outside and the mess inside.

You wriggle backward under the shelf toward Rusk’s side, cheek skimming gritty floorboards. The oilskin intruder lunges his hook-blade under after you; you kick out on reflex. Your heel catches his wrist. He hisses and the blade skitters, carving a shallow groove in the wood where your calf had been.

“Rusk, on my pull—crawl!”

You get a fistful of his belt/coat hem and start dragging him inches at a time. Rusk cooperates—elbows and knees, staying low—face tight with pain. He moves, but not fast; every pull draws a sharp breath out of him.

The baton-man, now back on a knee, spots what you’re doing. He doesn’t try to tip the shelf again—he jabs the baton under at floor level, aiming for your hands.

The baton clips your knuckles. Pain flashes white; your grip almost breaks, but you keep hold of Rusk’s coat and yank again. Blood from your grazed shoulder smears on the floor where you’ve slid.

The intruder changes angle, crawling along the shelf line to cut you off, hook-blade fishing for your ankle again—closer now because you’ve backed toward the shelf’s end.

Outside the door, the patrolman shouts, strained: “I need a wagon—armed suspect—Pier Nine district—now!” He’s alive, but he’s staying behind cover; he’s not storming in yet.

**What’s true right now:** you’ve moved Rusk a couple feet toward the doorway side under cover; the gunman is still active and has fired on patrol; the baton-man is stabbing under the shelf at your hands; the hook-blade intruder is repositioning to snag your legs as you near the shelf’s end.

### Turn 74 [PLAYER]

“Patrol—don’t rush! He’s inside the doorway, shooting from cover!” I shout, then I shrug out of my coat and whip the loose fabric toward the baton tip to snag/jam it under the shelf. 

I keep one hand locked on Rusk’s belt and drag again, inching him toward the shelf’s end, then kick hard at the hook-blade whenever it probes—aiming for wrist and blade to buy us one clean gap to slip out low.

*Agent reasoning: We’re close to the shelf’s end, which is a kill zone if I pop out. I need the patrol to draw the gunman’s attention while I keep Rusk moving, and I need to stop the baton from targeting my hands—disarm or jam it—without exposing myself to the hook-blade.*

### Turn 75 [GAME]

“Patrol—don’t rush! He’s inside the doorway, shooting from cover!”

Outside, the patrolman answers, voice tight behind cover: “Heard you! Stay down!” Boots splash—he shifts position rather than pushing in.

You shrug out of your coat in the cramped space. The move stings your grazed shoulder; warm blood slicks your upper arm as the fabric peels away. You whip the coat toward the baton as it jabs under the shelf.

It works—partly.

The baton tip catches in the coat lining for a second and you yank, trying to foul it. The baton-man reacts fast: he twists and **pins the coat with the baton**, then stomps the hanging fabric to the floor with his boot. The coat is trapped and the baton is momentarily slowed, but not neutralized.

You keep one hand locked on Rusk’s belt and drag again. Rusk crawls when you pull, teeth clenched, one knee dragging like it doesn’t want to bend. You gain another couple feet—close enough now that you can see the shelf’s end: a thin strip of open floor beyond it, exposed to the room.

The oilskin intruder probes with the hook-blade, fishing for your ankle as you near that edge. You kick hard.

Your heel smacks his wrist, then the flat of the blade. The hook-blade skips away with a metallic scrape and he swears, shaking out his hand. That buys you a clean half-second.

Then he changes tactics: he drives the hook-blade **down into the floorboard seam** near the shelf end and yanks, trying to lever the board up—creating a jagged lip right where you’d slide out. Splinters lift; a nail squeals.

The baton-man, still kneeling, gives up on stabbing for a beat and **lunges to grab Rusk’s ankle** as Rusk’s legs come near the shelf’s edge. His fingers brush trouser fabric—almost a hold.

At the doorway, the gunman fires again—two quick shots—this time not at you but at the patrolman’s cover outside. Plaster dust puffs in through the entrance. The patrolman yells in pain or alarm—hard to tell—and returns one shot into the shop. The round smashes a jar behind the counter; glass rains down.

You and Rusk are now **one body-length** from slipping out from under the shelf end—but the exit point is becoming a trap: a prying floorboard lip, an intruder poised to snag your legs, and a baton-man reaching for Rusk.

### Turn 76 [PLAYER]

I clamp both hands on Rusk’s belt and yank him back an inch—just enough to break the baton-man’s reach—then kick out hard at the baton-man’s fingers and forearm. “PATROL—FLASH IN! We’re under the shelf on the right!” I shout, then use my coat as a thick pad to smack down and trap the hook-blade against the floorboards for a heartbeat while I drag Rusk forward in one committed pull toward the shelf’s end.

*Agent reasoning: The shelf end is turning into a kill zone; we need to stop the grab and the hook long enough to slip out low, then immediately get the patrol’s attention without exposing ourselves to the gunman.*

### Turn 77 [GAME]

You clamp both hands on Rusk’s belt and yank him back a hard inch.

It’s just enough. The baton-man’s reaching hand closes on empty air instead of Rusk’s ankle, fingers scraping wet floorboards. You kick out immediately—your heel catches his knuckles and then his forearm.

He yelps and recoils, cradling his hand. “Bitch—!”

“PATROL—FLASH IN! We’re under the shelf on the right!” you shout.

Outside, the patrolman answers without moving in yet: “I DON’T HAVE A FLASH—STAY DOWN!” His voice is closer now, angled like he’s pressed to the wall by the door.

You swing your coat like a heavy pad and slap it down over the hook-blade as it scrapes for you. For a heartbeat, you’ve got it: fabric pinned under your palm, the blade’s curve trapped against the floorboards.

The oilskin intruder snarls and **yanks**. The hook-blade tears through the coat lining with a brutal *shhk* and rips free. The coat saves your hand from being cut, but it’s shredded and no longer a reliable block.

You commit—one full pull on Rusk’s belt, dragging him forward toward the shelf’s end.

Rusk slides out first, low and scrambling, shoulder and hip clearing the shelf into open floor. You follow, but the moment your legs reach that jagged floorboard lip the intruder pried up, it bites: a nail catches your trouser cuff and **snags** you mid-slide.

At the same instant, the baton-man lunges again—this time grabbing for *you*, not Rusk. His good hand clamps your ankle.

You’re half out, half in: Rusk is in the open, low; you’re pinned by a snagged cuff and a grip on your ankle.

The gunman, hearing movement, snaps his pistol toward the shelf end. He doesn’t fire yet—he’s checking the doorway and you in the same glance—but the muzzle is coming around.

Outside, you hear another set of boots arriving at a run and a shouted order: “RUSK? RUSK, SOUND OFF!”

Rusk, on the floor, croaks out, “Here—!” and tries to crawl toward the counter for cover, leaving you momentarily exposed at the shelf’s edge with a man on your ankle and a pistol turning your way.

### Turn 78 [PLAYER]

I go limp for a split-second, then twist my trapped leg inward and stomp my free heel down hard on the baton-man’s gripping hand. “PATROL—HE’S GOT ME BY THE ANKLE, GUNMAN’S TURNING ON THE SHELF END—PUSH NOW!”

I claw at my snagged cuff and yank it free even if it tears, then roll low toward the counter side after Rusk, keeping my head flat to the floor and using the shelf corner as cover.

*Agent reasoning: I’m pinned and a pistol is coming around—priority is to break the ankle grip and get out of the snag without presenting a target. Noise and patrol presence are my leverage, so I’ll call for them to push while I make myself a bad shot and slip free.*

### Turn 79 [GAME]

You go limp for the half-beat—ankle slack in his grip—then twist inward and bring your free heel down like a hammer.

Your heel lands on the baton-man’s gripping hand with a wet crunch. He howls and his fingers spring open. His forearm jerks back under the shelf edge, and he scrambles away on his knees, cradling the hand against his chest.

“PATROL—HE’S GOT ME BY THE ANKLE, GUNMAN’S TURNING ON THE SHELF END—PUSH NOW!”

Outside, the newly arrived voice barks, “MOVE—MOVE!” Boots slap water; someone takes the doorway angle.

You claw at your snagged cuff. The nail has you good. You yank anyway—fabric tears with a sharp rip, and the cuff comes free, leaving a jagged strip of trouser leg behind on the nail.

You roll low toward the counter side after Rusk, head flat, shoulder scraping grit. The shelf corner gives you a sliver of cover for a breath—

—then the gunman commits. He fires at the shelf end where you *were*.

The shot punches into the floorboards behind you with a splintering crack; wood chips sting your cheek. A second shot follows immediately, lower and wider, and you feel heat whip past your ear—close enough to make your hearing ring.

Rusk crawls hard toward the counter, dragging his bad leg, and he knocks into a fallen chair leg. It clatters, loud in the small shop.

The oilskin intruder with the hook-blade surges out from the shelf line, trying to follow your roll, but he hesitates as the doorway fills: a patrolman’s silhouette and a raised revolver appear in the entrance.

“DROP IT!” the newcomer roars.

The gunman snaps his pistol toward the door instead of finishing you. He fires once at the silhouette. The patrolman at the entrance jerks back out of sight, and you hear a pained shout and a body hitting the wet brick outside.

Now the shop has two active threats in motion: the gunman trading fire with patrol at the doorway, and the hook-blade intruder angling to cut you off from the counter while you’re still on the floor, exposed between shelf and counter with your coat shredded and your pant leg torn.

### Turn 80 [PLAYER]

I crawl fast and flat for the back side of the counter, grabbing Rusk’s collar to tug him with me into cover. “Rusk—stay down. Find something heavy or sharp, now.”

Without lifting my head, I shout toward the doorway, “Gunman’s using the doorframe—hook-blade man is inside, moving right toward the counter!” Then I reach up just enough to sweep for anything behind the counter—bottle, metal rod, drawer handle—something to use as a weapon or to throw.

*Agent reasoning: I’m exposed between shelf and counter; I need hard cover and to avoid drawing fire. The hook-blade is the immediate close threat, while patrol can keep the gunman busy. I’ll get behind the counter, arm Rusk with something, and give patrol clear target info without standing up.*

### Turn 81 [GAME]

You crawl fast and flat, palms sliding through spilled syrup and glass grit, and hook two fingers into the back of Rusk’s collar. He grunts as you yank him the last yard into the dead space behind the counter. His bad leg drags, but he’s in cover with you—both of you pressed to the baseboards, breathing hard.

“Rusk—stay down. Find something heavy or sharp, now.”

Rusk nods once, face grey, and starts pawing blindly along the floor behind the counter with one hand, the other clamped to his ribs.

You keep your head low and shout toward the doorway, “Gunman’s using the doorframe—hook-blade man is inside, moving right toward the counter!”

Outside, someone answers through clenched pain: “I HEARD—” followed by a sharper voice, closer to the threshold: “CLEAR THE DOOR!”

A gunshot cracks—this time from outside into the shop. The round smacks the inner doorframe and spits wood into the air. The gunman curses and shifts his angle, no longer comfortably posted.

You reach up just enough to sweep behind the counter. Your fingers find:

- A squat **glass bottle** (cheap spirits), slick with condensation.
- A **steel can-opener** the size of your palm, sharp-edged and utilitarian.
- A **drawer** that’s half-open—inside, your hand brushes **coins**, a stubby **pencil**, and a **thin metal skewer** (for olives or pickles).
- A **heavy brass bell** bolted to the counter edge—too fixed to take, but right where you could smash a hand into it.

As you’re feeling around, the hook-blade intruder appears at the counter’s far end—oilskin shoulder and forearm sliding into view low. He’s moving carefully, using the counter as a guide, hook-blade held inverted to catch ankles.

He doesn’t see you yet, but he’s close—six feet, then five—closing on your position behind the counter.

Rusk whispers, hoarse: “Got… something.” You hear metal scrape. He’s found a **meat tenderizer**—short handle, heavy head—likely dropped from the earlier struggle, and he grips it like he’s afraid his hand will fail.

At the doorway, boots splash—someone is trying to push in, but the gunman is still there, trading angles. The immediate threat is the hook-blade man about to round the counter end and look down into your cover.

### Turn 82 [PLAYER]

I press the bottle into Rusk’s hand and whisper, “If he pops up—smash and swing.” I keep the can-opener in my fist, then flick the thin skewer low across the floor toward the far end of the counter to make a faint clink away from us; as the hook-blade rounds the corner, I stay prone and slash up at his Achilles/ankle with the can-opener, then immediately scoot back deeper into cover.

*Agent reasoning: The hook-blade man is the closest threat and hasn’t spotted me yet. I need to stop him silently and fast while keeping Rusk protected; a distraction for the gunman/patrol can come second.*

### Turn 83 [GAME]

You press the cold bottle into Rusk’s hand. He takes it with a shaking grip, nodding once like it costs him something.

“If he pops up—smash and swing.”

You keep the can-opener tight in your fist—thumb braced along the spine—then flick the thin skewer flat along the floor. It skitters under the counter’s far lip and taps metal with a faint *clink… clink* as it comes to rest near the other end.

The hook-blade man’s head and shoulder dip toward that sound. He shifts his weight and edges along the counter line toward the far end—exactly the wrong way for a clean approach on you, but it also brings his legs past your cover.

He rounds the corner.

You stay prone and slash upward.

The can-opener’s sharp edge bites into the back of his ankle—more of a ripping gouge than a clean cut—but it hits tendon-rich flesh. He jerks like he’s been stung by a live wire and slams his boot down hard, trying to pin your hand.

You yank back in time; the sole thumps the floor where your knuckles were. Blood immediately darkens the cuff of his oilskin trouser leg and runs into his boot.

He snarls, breath hissing through teeth. “Down there—!”

Instead of retreating, he drops to a knee and jabs the hook-blade under the counter, sweeping for your shins in a short, vicious arc. The blade catches the torn edge of your pant leg and tugs—hard—trying to drag you out by the fabric.

You scoot back deeper into cover, hips and shoulders scraping, and the fabric tears again. The hook-blade comes away with a strip of cloth, not you.

Rusk rises just enough to strike. He smashes the bottle down onto the intruder’s forearm.

Glass bursts with a sharp crack. The intruder recoils, arm snapping back, oilskin sleeve glittering with wet shards and liquor. He yelps and staggers sideways, his injured ankle buckling for a half-step—then he catches himself on the counter, breathing fast, bleeding and angry.

At the doorway, another gunshot bangs—closer now—and the gunman barks, “KEEP YOUR HEADS DOWN!” His voice is inside the shop, not outside.

Threats now: the hook-blade man is wounded but still mobile at the counter end, and the gunman has pushed in enough that any movement above counter height risks drawing fire.

### Turn 84 [PLAYER]

I grab Rusk’s wrist and pull him down. “Stay low—don’t give the doorway a silhouette.”

I shout toward the patrol, “GUNMAN IS INSIDE THE THRESHOLD, SHOOTING IN—HOOK-BLADE’S WOUNDED AT THE COUNTER END, RIGHT SIDE!”

Then I crawl a foot closer along the baseboard and jab the can-opener into the hook-blade man’s wounded ankle again—hard—trying to drop him, and immediately yank back under the counter before he can hook my legs.

*Agent reasoning: We’re pinned by the gunman’s line of sight, so I need to stay low, reduce the hook-blade threat, and give patrol usable info without exposing myself. If we can disable the hook-blade man’s mobility, patrol can handle the gunman.*

### Turn 85 [GAME]

You clamp Rusk’s wrist and haul him down. He goes with it, shoulders hitting the baseboard, bottle shards crunching under his sleeve.

“Stay low—don’t give the doorway a silhouette.”

You shout toward the patrol, “GUNMAN IS INSIDE THE THRESHOLD, SHOOTING IN—HOOK-BLADE’S WOUNDED AT THE COUNTER END, RIGHT SIDE!”

Outside, a voice answers—tight, controlled: “COPY!” A second later: “BACK—LET ME SEE HIM—” Someone’s trying to get a clean lane past the doorframe without stepping into it.

You crawl a foot closer along the baseboard, keeping your head below the counter lip. The hook-blade man is braced against the counter end, weight off the bad ankle—breathing hard, trying to decide whether to come over the top or fish for you again.

You jab the can-opener into the same wounded ankle, hard.

It goes in with resistance—then a sudden give. He screams, sharp and involuntary, and his leg kicks out. His ankle buckles completely; his knee slams to the floor with a heavy *thud*. The hook-blade clatters as his grip spasms.

But his pain buys you only a heartbeat. His free hand lashes down and grabs for you by feel—fingers catching your coat sleeve near the elbow. He yanks, trying to drag you into the open at the counter end where he can get the hook-blade back under you.

You wrench backward under the counter. Your sleeve rips; you slip free and skid back into deeper cover, forearm stinging where fabric tore.

The hook-blade man is now half-collapsed at the counter end, one knee down, one hand clamped around his ankle, bleeding into his boot. He’s not out—just hurt and furious—and he’s groping for his dropped hook-blade, patting the floor with shaking fingers.

At the threshold, the gunman reacts to your shout by snapping his pistol toward the counter line. He fires twice, fast, trying to punch rounds through the counter’s upper panels where he thinks you are.

Both shots hit wood above you—one blows a fist-sized splintered crater through the counter face, the other punches into a drawer. Coins erupt and rain down behind the counter, stinging your knuckles and cheek with metal flecks and wood shards.

Rusk flinches and curls tighter, breathing ragged.

Immediate threats are clear: the gunman has a firing angle into the counter face and is actively walking shots along it, and the hook-blade man—wounded—still has reach if he gets that hook-blade back in hand.

### Turn 86 [PLAYER]

I grab a fistful of spilled coins and snap my wrist, scattering them hard across the floor toward the doorway to draw the gunman’s aim off our exact spot. “PATROL—HE’S FIRING THROUGH THE COUNTER FACE; WAIT FOR HIS RELOAD THEN PUSH LEFT!” I hiss to Rusk, “On my pull—crawl deeper, stay glued to the baseboard.”

Then I belly-crawl toward the counter end and, keeping low, hook the dropped hook-blade with the can-opener’s edge and drag it back under the counter toward me, away from the wounded man’s reaching hand.

*Agent reasoning: The gunman’s firing into the counter; staying put gets us shredded. The hook-blade is wounded and momentarily distracted—best chance is to disarm him quietly while patrol pins the gunman. I need to signal patrol a safe angle and move Rusk to better cover.*

### Turn 88 [PLAYER]

I freeze behind the counter, keeping my head down. “I need a quick read—where are the gunman and the wounded hook-blade now, and is patrol still outside the doorway or has anyone entered?”

*Agent reasoning: With the scene unclear, I need to confirm positions and immediate threats before making a move that could expose us to the gunman or the hook-blade.*

### Turn 89 [GAME]

You go still. Cheek to the gritty floor, you listen through the counter’s buzzing silence—wood settling, coins rolling to a stop, someone breathing like they’re trying not to.

**Gunman:** He’s **just inside the threshold**, not fully committed into the shop—close enough that rain air and street noise still leak around him. His boots scrape on the wet entry tile as he shifts for angle. You hear him mutter, “—damn—” then a quick metallic *tap* against the doorframe: he’s using it as cover while he leans in and out. His pistol isn’t firing right now; you catch the small, distinct sounds of **a magazine being seated** and a slide being worked—he’s **reloading/confirming** rather than shooting blind.

**Hook-blade man:** He’s at the **counter end, right side**, half down. One knee is on the floor; the other foot is planted wrong, forced to carry weight it can’t. He’s **hissing through clenched teeth** with his hand clamped around the ankle you opened up. With the other hand he’s **patting the floor**, feeling for the dropped hook-blade. He hasn’t found it yet—his fingers keep sweeping the same small patch near the counter leg, jittery and desperate.

**Patrol:** They’re **still outside the doorway**, not in the shop. You hear two sets of footsteps repositioning on wet pavement and a voice—strained, authoritative—calling, “HARBOR PATROL! DROP IT AND STEP OUT!” Another voice answers low: “He’s using the frame—can’t see his hands.” No one enters; they’re trying to get an angle without crossing the fatal funnel.

**Immediate threat:** the gunman is about to lean in again with a fresh mag, and the hook-blade man is close to either recovering his blade or grabbing whatever limb he can reach if you drift toward the counter end.

I hiss to Rusk, “Now—crawl deeper, slow, stay flat,” and shove the loose coins toward him to keep his hands busy and low. 

I whisper-shout toward the doorway, “PATROL—HE’S RELOADING AT THE FRAME, DON’T PUSH THE THRESHOLD—ANGLE LEFT AND HOLD!” 

Then I belly-crawl toward the counter end and, staying under the lip, hook the dropped hook-blade with my can-opener and drag it back under the counter toward me, away from his searching hand.

*Agent reasoning: Gunman is reloading—brief window. Hook-blade is disarmed but searching; I should deny him the weapon and help patrol get a safe angle without exposing myself.*

Rusk nods once—more a twitch than a gesture—and starts to worm backward along the baseboard, shoulders scraping plaster. You shove a spill of coins toward him; he instinctively cups them, keeping his hands low and giving him something to do besides panic. A couple coins skitter out anyway, ticking softly under the counter.

Your whisper-shout carries. Outside, a patrolman answers, “LEFT SIDE—MOVE!” Boots splash in the alley. Another voice—closer to the frame—barks, “DON’T CROSS!” They’re taking your instruction, but they still won’t commit through the threshold.

You belly-crawl toward the counter end. The air is thicker there—blood and old floor cleaner. The wounded hook-blade man’s fingers are still sweeping, closer now, frantic.

You slide the can-opener out and catch the hook-blade’s handle on the opener’s edge. It drags with a harsh scrape across the floorboards.

The wounded man hears it instantly. He lunges—fast despite the ankle—arm shooting under the counter. His hand clamps onto the hook-blade’s curved metal, not the handle, and he howls as the edge bites his palm. He doesn’t let go. He yanks back hard, trying to pull it out of your leverage.

You pull the other way. For a second it’s a tug-of-war under the counter: his bleeding hand on steel, your can-opener hooked and straining, the blade shivering between you.

At the doorway, the gunman snaps back in with his fresh mag. He fires once—low—aiming by sound at the scrape. The round punches through the counter face near the end and detonates a drawer rail. Splinters whip across your forearm and cheek; the impact thuds through the wood inches above your head.

The hook-blade jerks in the wounded man’s grip at the shot. His injured ankle shifts; he grunts and momentarily loses strength.

You gain a few inches—enough to pull the hook-blade’s handle under the counter lip toward your side—but he’s still got a bloody grip on the metal, and the gunman now has a confirmed sound cue at the counter end.

Threats, clear: **gunman is actively shooting into the counter end**; **the wounded man is half-attached to the hook-blade and can still lunge/grab under the counter**.

### Turn 92 [PLAYER]

I go still for half a beat, then slam my heel into his wounded ankle and twist the hook-blade sideways with the can-opener to make the edge bite his palm harder. “Let go or you lose the hand,” I hiss, then yank the handle fully under the counter and shove it back behind me out of his reach.

Without lifting my head, I call toward the doorway, “PATROL—HOLD FIRE A SECOND, I’M DISARMING HIM AT THE COUNTER END—GUNMAN’S STILL USING SOUND!” Then I crab-crawl back a foot to quieter cover, keeping the hook-blade low and tight to my body.

*Agent reasoning: Tug-of-war is getting me shot at; I need to break his grip and deny him the blade fast, then get quiet so the gunman loses the sound cue. Use his injured hand/ankle against him, and coordinate patrol to hold fire until they have an angle.*

### Turn 93 [GAME]

Your heel finds his ankle like a nail finds soft wood.

He makes a sound that isn’t a word—air torn out of him—and his leg buckles. The wounded joint rolls; you feel the tremor of it through the floorboards. His grip spasms on the hook-blade’s metal, and when you twist sideways with the can-opener the edge chews deeper into his palm. Warm blood slicks the blade; his fingers finally betray him.

“—NO—” he chokes, and lets go.

You yank the handle fully under the counter and shove it back behind your ribs, tight and low. The hook-blade’s weight is ugly in your hand—balanced for tearing, not fencing.

At the doorway, your shout lands. Outside, a patrol voice snaps, “HOLD—HOLD!” Boots shuffle back from the frame. But the gunman isn’t patrol.

He fires again anyway—two quick shots, timed right after your voice. One round punches through the counter face where your mouth just was; the other skips off something metal inside the drawer cavity and ricochets with a vicious whine. Splinters sting your knuckles as you crab-crawl back into quieter shadow.

The wounded man, now disarmed, doesn’t lunge for the blade—he lunges for you. His bloody hand shoots under the counter, clawing for your coat hem. His fingers catch fabric and drag, weak but desperate, trying to anchor you so the gunman can finish it.

Rusk, deeper down the counter line, hisses through his teeth, “Lena—!” He doesn’t rise; you hear him scrabble at the coins you shoved him, using them to stay low and inch farther from the counter end.

Outside, patrol keeps their line—no one enters—but you hear one of them call, “GUN—DROP IT!” followed by the hard clack of a longarm being shouldered.

Immediate threats now: **the gunman is shooting by sound through the counter**, and **the wounded man has a grip on your coat and is trying to hold you in place**. You’ve got the hook-blade secured behind you.

### Turn 94 [PLAYER]

I go dead quiet and slice the hook-blade down across his reaching wrist/forearm under the counter—one hard cut—then rip my coat hem free and crab-crawl backward into deeper cover. In a low whisper toward the doorway: “Patrol—he’s firing on sound; go silent and take him when he leans.”

*Agent reasoning: He’s anchoring me for the gunman’s sound-aimed shots; I need to get free quietly and stop him grabbing again, without shouting or exposing myself.*

### Turn 95 [GAME]

You stop breathing. Even the coins seem to hold their shine.

Under the counter, you bring the hook-blade down once—hard, committed. The edge catches his wrist/forearm where it’s stretched and straining on your coat. There’s a wet, resistant bite; then his grip collapses.

He yelps and jerks back so fast his elbow bangs the counter leg. Blood spatters the underside of the wood and patters onto the floor in fat drops. His hand goes useless for a second, fingers flexing wrong, and he clamps his other hand over the cut, rocking on his hip with a thin, panicked moan.

Your coat hem tears with a sharp rip as you wrench free. You crab-crawl backward, slow and controlled, keeping your body flat and the hook-blade hugged close so it doesn’t scrape. You make it a full body-length deeper under the counter line—quieter cover, farther from the counter end.

At the doorway, your whisper reaches patrol. One of them answers back just as low, like they’re learning: “Copy. Quiet.”

Then the gunman does what you warned: he leans to listen.

You don’t hear his boots this time—he’s careful—but you do hear the faint brush of his sleeve on the frame. A heartbeat later, patrol’s longarm cracks from outside—one clean shot.

The round hits wood, not flesh. It punches the doorframe just above where his head would’ve been if he’d leaned another inch. The gunman snaps back out of sight instantly.

He returns fire blind—one shot into the shop, higher than before. The bullet takes a glass jar off a shelf; it explodes into sugar and shards that rain down, tinkling across the tile and into the quiet like thrown gravel.

The wounded hook-blade man is no longer grabbing you—he’s bleeding and retreating on his elbows toward the back wall, leaving a smear. But he’s still conscious, eyes wide, watching you with raw hate and fear, and his uninjured hand is feeling around for *anything* to arm himself with.

Threats now: **gunman still at the frame, trading shots with patrol and probing by sound**; **wounded man mobile and desperate, seeking a new weapon inside the shop**.

### Turn 96 [PLAYER]

I whisper to Rusk, “Stay down—don’t move.” Keeping low, I inch along the counter to get a sightline on the wounded man’s hands and whatever’s within his reach, then murmur toward patrol, “If you’ve got a back entry or window, take it—he’s pinned on the frame but he’ll keep fishing for sound.”

*Agent reasoning: The gunman is using sound cues, so staying quiet and not moving into his line matters. The wounded man is still a threat if he finds a weapon; I should control him without making noise, and get eyes on the room layout before any push.*

### Turn 97 [GAME]

Rusk doesn’t answer, but you feel him comply: the faint scrape of his coat stops, his breathing goes shallow. He stays a lump behind the counter—smart, terrified, quiet.

You inch along the counter on your elbows and knees, moving slow enough your clothes don’t rasp. The sugar and glass from the shattered jar crunch under your sleeve once—one tiny betray-and-regret sound—then you freeze until the room settles again.

From your new angle you catch the wounded man clearly: he’s backed against the base of a shelf near the rear wall, knees bent, boots slick with his own blood. His cut arm is pressed to his chest, but his good hand is pawing the floor and low shelf space.

Within his reach:  
- a **short wooden stool** tipped on its side (easy club)  
- a **broken jar shard** glittering near his knee (small knife)  
- the **thin metal skewer** you dropped earlier, half under a shelf edge (reachable if he stretches)  

His eyes lock on the skewer as soon as his fingers find it. He starts to snake his hand toward it, inch by inch, trying not to make noise.

At the doorway, you murmur to patrol about a back entry. A patrolman answers, tight and irritated: “No back—shop’s bricked. We got the alley only.” Another voice—different, older—adds, “Window’s barred. He’s got to come out or we go in.”

As if to prove it, the gunman at the frame taps something against the doorjamb—metal on wood, a deliberate *tick…tick*—testing how you react to sound. Then he goes still again.

Inside, the wounded man commits: he stretches for the skewer. His fingertips hook it and drag it toward him. The skewer’s tip scratches the floor with a faint, high squeal.

Immediate threats: **wounded man is about to arm himself with the skewer or a shard**, and **gunman is actively baiting and listening at the doorway; patrol has no alternate entry and is considering pushing in**.

### Turn 98 [PLAYER]

I creep closer under the counter, then flick a handful of coins out toward the doorway to make a sharp, misleading jingle; as it lands, I slide out and drive the hook-blade’s flat into the wounded man’s knuckles to pin his hand and knock the skewer away. In a low hiss right in his face: “Stay down and live.”

*Agent reasoning: The wounded man re-arming is the closest, quietest threat; stopping him without drawing the gunman’s fire is priority. I need to keep noise minimal and avoid giving the gunman a sound cue.*

### Turn 99 [GAME]

You creep up until the counter edge is almost touching your cheek, then snap your wrist and send a spill of coins skittering across the tile toward the doorway.

The jingle is sharp, bright—too bright in the hush.

At the frame, the gunman bites. You hear his coat brush and a quick inhale. He fires at the sound—one shot, low and fast—straight into the doorway-side floor where the coins are still spinning. The round smacks tile and throws up a spray of grit.

Patrol answers immediately. A longarm booms from outside, followed by a second shot a beat later. The second catches something—there’s a meaty *thunk* and a grunt, and the gunman stumbles back out of the doorway line. You don’t see him fall, but you hear his boots drag on wet pavement as he retreats into the rain.

Inside, you use the gunfire as cover and slide out from under the counter toward the wounded man in one smooth push.

He’s got the skewer—half in his fist now—trying to bring it up like a nail to your throat.

You slam the hook-blade’s flat down across his knuckles. Bone pops under the pressure; his fingers spill open. The skewer jumps and clatters away, spinning under the shelf where his good hand can’t reach without crawling.

He tries to snatch the broken jar shard instead, but you keep the blade’s flat pressed there—pinning, not cutting—until his hand shakes and goes slack.

Up close, his face is gray with pain and sweat, eyes glassy, jaw working like he’s chewing his own tongue. When you hiss, “Stay down and live,” he swallows hard and nods once—small, furious, but real.

Outside, patrol shouts, “He’s moving—LEFT!” Boots splash as they reposition. Someone yells, “Don’t lose him!”

Immediate threats now: **the gunman has pulled back into the rain and may try to flank or disappear**, and **patrol is shifting focus outside—meaning you and Rusk are briefly not their priority if the doorway stays quiet**. The wounded man is disarmed, but still conscious and close enough to bite, spit, or lunge.

### Turn 100 [PLAYER]

I keep the hook-blade flat against his hand a moment longer, then shift to pin his forearm with my knee and yank his belt free to bind his wrists tight. “If you move, I cut,” I mutter.

Without looking up, I whisper toward Rusk, “Now—crawl to me, slow.” Then I call low toward the doorway, “PATROL—GUNMAN’S OUTSIDE LEFT; DON’T PUSH IN—ONE OF YOU COVER THIS DOOR, I’M TYING UP THE ONE INSIDE.”

*Agent reasoning: The gunman’s retreat is our biggest risk—he could circle back. I need to secure the wounded man quickly, get Rusk moving, and signal patrol not to rush in blind.*

### Turn 101 [GAME]

You keep the hook-blade’s flat pressed until the wounded man’s hand stops twitching. Then you shift your weight—knee into his forearm, your shin braced against his ribs so he can’t roll.

When you yank his belt, he jerks on instinct, teeth bared. The hook-blade’s edge kisses skin just enough to remind him it isn’t a bluff. He freezes, breathing in wet little pulls.

You thread the belt around his wrists and cinch it hard. Leather bites. He grunts once—more anger than pain—then tries a twist; the belt holds. His hands are bound tight in front of him, knuckles already swelling, blood from the earlier cut slicking the strap.

“Move, I cut,” you mutter. He nods again, smaller this time, eyes down.

Behind you, Rusk finally moves. He doesn’t crawl so much as drag himself—one elbow, then the other—keeping his head low. He gets to your side, close enough that his shoulder bumps the counter base. In the dim you see his face: pale, rainwater and sweat on his lip, one hand clamped around his side like he’s trying to keep something in.

Your call to patrol changes the rhythm outside immediately.

A voice snaps back, “COPY—DOOR COVERED.” Boots slap into a new position right outside the threshold, and you hear the scrape of a longarm settling onto the doorframe for a steadier angle.

Another patrolman yells farther left, “I got movement—by the alley mouth!” A shot cracks, then another. Not the controlled boom from earlier—these are hurried.

Then: a hard metallic *clack* and the ugly whine of a ricochet off brick. Someone outside curses, high and scared. “He’s got cover—can’t see—”

The threat becomes clear in the next second: something small and hard skitters into the shop through the doorway and rolls across the tile, ticking as it spins—coming to rest near the coins you threw earlier.

It’s a palm-sized cylinder with a fuse spitting bright, angry sparks.

Rusk’s eyes go wide. He sucks in breath to shout but it catches in his throat.

You have maybe a heartbeat or two before it goes off—right there on the shop floor between you and the door.

### Turn 102 [PLAYER]

I shove Rusk flat and haul him behind the thickest part of the counter, throwing my body over him, head down and mouth open. “GRENADE IN—GET BACK!” I bark toward the doorway, then clamp my hands over the back of my neck and brace for the blast.

*Agent reasoning: That’s a thrown explosive—no time to be clever. Best odds are to get behind solid cover and protect Rusk from shrapnel; don’t run toward the door. I’ll also warn patrol so they don’t step in or get caught by the blast.*

### Turn 103 [GAME]

You flatten Rusk and drag him behind the counter’s thick corner—where the wood’s doubled and the shelving braces it—then throw your body over him. Your shout hits the doorway like a slap.

Outside, someone yells, “BACK—BACK!” Boots skid on rain-slick tile at the threshold as the door-cover man jerks away from the frame.

The cylinder pops with a sharp *crack*—not a deep military thump, more like a brutal firework—then detonates.

The blast doesn’t tear the shop apart; it *shreds* the front half of it. A wave of glass and tile grit slams into the counter face like thrown gravel. The counter shudders and the impact hammers your ribs. Your ears go instantly dull, replaced by a high, steady whine.

Splinters bite into your coat and the back of your neck. Something hot stings your left shoulder—surface burn, not deep. Rusk convulses under you, a strangled sound trapped in his chest, but he’s still moving.

The doorway becomes a white, smoking rectangle for a second. Then the smoke thins enough to show the floor: peppered with bright metal flecks. That’s when the pain arrives—dozens of tiny cuts along your forearms and cheek where you weren’t fully covered.

Outside, a patrolman screams—full-throated—and collapses out of view with a wet slap, hit by shrapnel. Another voice shouts, “MEDIC—MEDIC!” and someone fires twice into the rain, blind and angry.

Behind you, the wounded man you tied up lets out a hoarse laugh that turns into coughing. He’s alive—but the blast has rolled him onto his side, belt still cinched, and he’s wriggling, trying to get his bound hands under him to crawl.

New, immediate threat: through the thinning smoke at the doorway, a dark shape cuts across the opening—fast, low—using the chaos to reposition. Not inside yet, but close enough that the next move could be a rush or another thrown device.

Rusk’s voice finally breaks through the ringing, thin and panicked: “Lena—my side— I—” His hand is slick when it brushes your sleeve. Blood.

### Turn 104 [PLAYER]

I hook a boot over the bound man’s belt and shove him back against the shelf base, then press the hook-blade to his throat. “One more wriggle and you bleed out faster,” I hiss.  

I turn to Rusk, keep my voice low. “Show me—where’s it hit?” I yank a strip from my shirt hem and clamp it hard to his side.  

Toward the doorway, barely above a whisper: “Patrol—don’t fire blind. He’ll rush on the noise. If you’ve got a shield, bring it; otherwise hold and listen.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re pinned and the gunman may rush; Rusk is bleeding and needs to stay quiet and alive. I should secure the tied man so he can’t crawl, then get Rusk’s bleeding under control and coordinate with patrol without exposing us.*

### Turn 105 [GAME]

Your boot hooks the belt binding his wrists and you shove. The bound man slides on grit and broken glass until his shoulder thumps the shelf base. He tries to curl away, but there’s nowhere to go; the shelving pins him in place.

You lay the hook-blade to the soft notch under his jaw. Not cutting—just enough pressure that he feels the edge find skin. His throat works. He goes still, breathing through his nose, eyes locked on you with a mix of hate and calculation. No more wriggling.

Rusk fumbles his coat open with shaking fingers and pulls your hand to the right side of his belly, just above the beltline. There’s a shrapnel cut—ragged and ugly, bleeding steady rather than spurting. When you rip a strip from your shirt hem and clamp down, the blood soaks it almost immediately, but the pressure slows it to a thick ooze. Rusk grits his teeth and nods, trying not to make a sound.

At the doorway, your whisper carries. A patrolman answers low, voice tight: “No shield. We’ve got one man down—bleeding bad.” Another one says, “Copy: holding.”

Then something changes outside: not gunfire—*quiet*. Footsteps stop splashing. The rain noise feels suddenly louder because the street goes still.

A faint, almost musical *ting* rides the air from just beyond the threshold—like a wire under tension being tapped.

And then, from the downspout just outside the door, a short metallic cough: *pfft-CHUNK*.

A capsule bursts at ankle height, flashing white through the smoke-haze and spitting a fan of wet dye across the doorway and floor. Blue, unnaturally clean—like neon paint in rain. Droplets pepper the tile and the lower edge of the counter, and a spray catches your trouser leg and the side of your coat.

The patrolman at the door swears, “What the hell—? My boots—” He staggers back, tracking blue footprints.

Outside, a voice you don’t recognize calls, calm and close: “Marked.”

The threat is immediate and specific now: **someone has set a tripwire dye/flash device at the doorway** and you’ve been splashed—making you trackable in the rain and giving whoever’s outside a confirmation that you’re still in here. The bound man’s eyes flick to the blue on your leg, and he smiles despite the blade at his throat.

### Turn 106 [PLAYER]

I press the blade a hair firmer under the bound man’s jaw. “Tell your friend outside what comes next if he steps in—now.”

To Rusk, low: “Keep pressure. Don’t look at the door.” I grab a wet rag or towel from under the counter and scrub at the blue on my coat and trouser leg, then smear the rag across the floor in a messy fan to muddy any clean track.

Toward patrol, tight whisper: “We’re marked with dye—watch for tripwires. Is there any other way out—roof hatch, back hall, even a crawlspace? Don’t answer loud; just tap twice if yes.”

*Agent reasoning: We’ve been marked, so staying put makes us easier to track; I need to reduce the dye, keep Rusk from bleeding out, and use the captive as leverage while confirming exits/traps before moving.*

### Turn 107 [GAME]

You press the hook-blade tighter. A bead of blood wells where the edge dimples his skin.

The bound man swallows hard, throat scraping the steel. He forces his voice up, loud enough to carry but rough with pain: “DON’T COME IN. SHE’S GOT ME. SHE’LL—” He breaks into a cough, then tries again, “She’ll open my throat. She’s—she’s got a cop bleeding behind the counter.”

Outside, the calm voice answers immediately, closer than before, like he’s just off to the side of the doorway: “He’s not your leverage.”

A second voice—different, younger—mutters, “We got the mark. That’s enough.”

Rusk nods at your instruction and keeps pressure on his own wound with both hands, eyes squeezed shut, breathing shallow. He doesn’t look at the door. His knuckles are going white around the cloth.

You reach under the counter. Your fingers find a bar towel—still damp, sour with old dishwater—and you scrub at the blue on your coat and trouser leg. It smears, lightening in places but staining into the fabric’s weave. The rag turns vivid cobalt.

You drag that rag across the tile in a wide, ugly fan. The clean, obvious footprints become a chaotic wash of blue and gray grit—harder to read at a glance, but now there’s *more* dyed surface area, and it glints wetly in the doorway light.

At your whisper to patrol, there’s a pause. Then, from somewhere just outside and to the right, you hear two quick, deliberate taps—metal on metal, like a flashlight ring against a railing. *Tap-tap.*

A patrolman’s voice follows, barely audible: “Back hall. Storage door. Locked.”

Before you can process it, the calm voice outside says, conversational: “They’re asking about exits.”

That lands like a punch: **someone outside is close enough to hear your whispers clearly**—either right at the threshold or with a listening tube/mic against the wall.

Then you hear it: a soft scrape against the exterior brick to the left of the doorway, followed by a thin, descending whine—something being fed down.

A small object drops into view at the top of the doorway and dangles on a line, swinging gently in the smoky air: a glass bulb the size of a plum, filled with pale fluid.

Threat, immediate: **they’re lowering a second device into the doorway on a line, positioning it to burst inside without stepping in.**

### Turn 108 [PLAYER]

I jerk the bound man’s collar up and shove him toward the doorway as a shield, blade at his throat. “Pull that bulb back or he dies—now.”

To Rusk, tight and low: “On me. We’re moving to the back hall—slow, keep that pressure.” I half-drag him along the counter line toward the storage door, eyes flicking up to track the hanging bulb for any drip or swing that means it’s about to burst.

Without words to patrol, I tap twice on the counter edge in answer, then point hard toward the back with two fingers—move, not shoot.

*Agent reasoning: They can hear whispers and are lowering a device to gas us out; staying by the door is suicide. Best move is immediate relocation to the back hall while we still can, and use the hostage to buy seconds. Need to warn patrol without giving details and keep Rusk moving.*

### Turn 110 [PLAYER]

I haul the bound man up by his collar and shove him toward the doorway as cover, hook-blade tight under his jaw. “Pull the bulb back or he dies—now.”

I keep Rusk tucked behind the counter line and half-drag him toward the back hall, murmuring, “On me—slow—keep pressure.” I watch the hanging bulb for any sudden stop, drip, or twitch that means it’s about to pop.

I tap twice on the counter edge to answer patrol, then jab two fingers hard toward the back—move, don’t shoot.

*Agent reasoning: The bulb-on-a-line is an immediate hazard and the outside voice can hear whispers, so I need to reduce exposure at the doorway and get to the back hall without provoking blind gunfire. Using the bound man as a moving shield is ugly but practical, and I need to communicate silently to patrol while keeping Rusk mobile and low.*

### Turn 111 [GAME]

You wrench the bound man upright by his collar. The belt bites into his wrists; he yelps and stumbles as you drive him toward the doorway with the hook-blade hard under his jaw. His feet skid through the smeared dye on the tile, leaving a darker, muddier trail.

“Pull it back,” you snap. “Or he dies—now.”

For half a second, the bulb on the line stops swinging.

Then the calm voice answers from just outside the frame of the door, flat as a ledger: “Do it.”

The line jerks—not up, but *down and in*. The bulb drops fast into the doorway space, right at the bound man’s chest level.

You see it clearly: the glass has a scored seam around its middle. No drip—just a hairline glint as it twists.

It *pops* with a wet crack.

A pale mist punches outward and clings low, like it’s heavier than air. It washes over the bound man first—his mouth opens to scream but turns into a strangled gag. His eyes slam shut; his knees buckle. The vapor rolls inward along the floor, crawling under the counter lip.

Immediate threat: **chemical irritant/knockdown gas in the doorway, spreading into the shop. Breathing and vision are about to get worse by the second.**

You keep Rusk tucked behind the counter and haul him toward the back hall. He moves, but the first breath of it catches him—he coughs hard, a wet bark that shakes his whole frame. Blood seeps through his makeshift bandage again as his hands reflexively loosen, then clamp back down.

At the front, your two taps on the counter get answered—boots scrape. One patrolman appears at the edge of the doorway, then recoils as the mist hits his shins. He jerks back, swearing, “Gas—!”

Another voice—young—barks, “Don’t go in. Let it work.”

The bound man, still in your grip, goes suddenly heavy. His legs fold. If you keep him up as a shield, you’re now holding a semi-conscious, choking weight in the worst of the vapor.

From outside, you hear a second line being handled—something else being readied—while the mist continues to spread inward toward your route to the back hall.

### Turn 112 [PLAYER]

I let the bound man crumple between the doorway and the counter to act as a stumbling block, then yank my sleeve over my mouth and nose and wave Rusk to keep his face high. 

I grab anything heavy behind the counter (a stool, crate, or small shelf unit) and shove it down low toward the doorway to slow the crawling mist, then half-drag Rusk into the back hall and shoulder the storage door. “Locked how—padlock or knob?” I rasp, scanning for a key hook, bolt cutters, or something to pry it.

*Agent reasoning: The gas is low and spreading; I need cleaner air and an exit fast. Keeping the hostage now is a liability and keeps me in the worst of the mist. I should get Rusk higher/away, block the gas path, and push for the locked back door without exposing us to the doorway.*

### Turn 113 [GAME]

You let the bound man go. He folds in a wet heap right where the doorway narrows—half in the threshold, half inside—arms pinned under him. His boots kick once, then scrape uselessly as the mist keeps eating at his lungs.

You haul your sleeve over your mouth and nose. It helps with the sting, not the burn. Your eyes water immediately; the blue smear on your cuff turns slick against your lips. You motion Rusk’s head up—he tries, but every breath makes him cough. He’s fighting to stay quiet and failing.

Behind the counter you find a squat wooden stool and a low crate of bottled sarsaparilla. You shove both down toward the doorway, scraping them hard across tile. The crate hits the bound man’s shoulder with a dull thump and wedges against him and the doorframe.

It doesn’t “stop” the mist, but it **forces it to pool and curl** around the obstruction instead of streaming straight in. The densest layer stays nearer the floor at the front for a few extra heartbeats—enough to move.

You half-drag Rusk into the back hall. The hall is narrow, stacked with sacks and a mop bucket; the air back here is clearer but still stings as the vapor creeps in low.

You shoulder the storage door. Solid. No give.

Rusk, voice shredded, points with a trembling finger: “Knob… deadbolt… inside key.” He coughs again, and you hear the metal rattle of the lockset when his shoulder bumps it—**it’s a keyed deadbolt, not a padlock.**

To the right of the doorframe is a short row of hooks—mostly empty. One hook holds a single key ring with two keys and a stamped brass tag: **“STOR.”**

As you reach, something hits the front windows—*tap tap tap*—small, fast impacts like gravel. Then a sharper crack: someone outside is striking the glass with a tool, testing for a weak point, timing it with the gas.

Threat now: **forced entry from the front within seconds to a minute, while the gas continues creeping down the hall at floor level.**

### Turn 114 [PLAYER]

I snatch the “STOR” key ring and jam the first key into the deadbolt, trying to turn it quick but controlled. “Rusk—stay up, breathe high. If I go down, you crawl through and keep going.”

If the bolt gives, I pull the door open just enough to slip Rusk through first, then glance back down the hall for anything I can kick over (mop bucket, sacks) to slow the low-lying gas before I follow and shut the door behind us.

*Agent reasoning: We’re running out of time—gas is creeping in and they’re about to breach the front. Best move is get through the storage door fast, then put barriers between us and the hall while keeping Rusk upright and moving.*

### Turn 115 [GAME]

The first key bites the deadbolt but doesn’t turn—wrong cut. Your fingers are slick; the metal feels like ice.

Behind you, down the hall, the gas reaches the baseboards in a thin, crawling layer. It doesn’t rush; it *seeks*. It eddies around the mop bucket and the stacked sacks, then keeps coming.

Rusk tries to keep his face high like you said, but another cough doubles him. He braces a hand on the wall and smears something dark—blood from his palm or his side, you can’t tell which in the dim.

You swap keys. The second key slides in clean.

The bolt gives with a hard, dry *clack*.

You pull the door open only a handspan. Cold, stale air spills out—storage air: dust, old cardboard, and something like pickling brine. You shove Rusk through first. He has to turn sideways, shoulder scraping the jamb; he bites down on a sound, then stumbles inside and catches himself on a shelf.

From the shop end comes a decisive *crack*—glass giving way. A voice calls, closer now, filtered and tight like someone has cloth over their mouth: “Back hall! Move!”

You glance down and kick the mop bucket over. Gray water slaps across the floor and runs into the low-lying vapor, making it curl and break into thinner tendrils for a moment. You ram your boot into the nearest sack pile; it slumps, spilling something granular that skitters under the gas like grit.

It buys you seconds, not safety.

You slip through after Rusk and pull the door shut. The latch catches. The deadbolt is still thrown open unless you turn it again.

On the other side of the door, you hear boots in the hall and a wet, dragging scrape—someone stepping around the fallen bucket. A hand hits the storage door once, testing, then another voice: “Locked. Find the other way—”

And then a softer, more worrying sound: metal on metal at the knob, like someone producing picks or a slim tool and deciding to take their time.

Inside the storage room, it’s tight aisles and high shelves. No obvious exit in the first glance—just stacked crates, a meat-hook rail, and a small, grimy window set too high to reach without climbing.

### Turn 116 [PLAYER]

I spin back to the door and throw the deadbolt, then press my ear to it for half a beat to gauge how close they are. “Rusk—get low behind the shelves, keep your face up; don’t let them hear you.” I drag a crate or shelf unit to stack under the high window and start climbing to test if it opens or can be kicked out quietly.

*Agent reasoning: They’re already working the lock; buying time matters. Securing the deadbolt and finding an alternate exit (window/vent) is safer than fighting in a cramped aisle. I also need to keep Rusk upright and quiet.*

### Turn 117 [GAME]

You twist the key and throw the deadbolt home. The bolt slides with a thick, final *thunk* that you feel through the door.

You put your ear to the wood.

On the other side: two sets of boots in the hall, close—right outside. One man’s breathing is loud and wet behind cloth. You hear a quick, irritated whisper: “She bolted it.”

A thin metal rasp touches the knob again—testing. Then a sharper tap-tap at the lock, like someone seating a pick and realizing the deadbolt isn’t going to politely cooperate.

A third voice, farther back toward the shop, calls: “Window! Check the back window—now!”

Rusk nods at your order, pale and sweating. He ducks behind the nearest shelving, trying to keep his head above the lowest haze that’s beginning to seep under the door in a faint, stinging ribbon. He clamps a hand over his mouth to smother the coughs, and you hear them anyway—muffled, ragged.

You grab a wooden crate and drag it under the high window. It screeches across the floor—loud in the tight room. Immediately, the men outside go quiet for half a second, listening.

Then: a knuckle-rap on the door, deliberate. “Miss Marrow,” a voice says—calm, practiced. “Open up. You’re making this worse.”

You climb onto the crate and reach the window. It’s a grimy, fixed sash with a simple latch… and a nailed-down stop. Someone’s made sure it doesn’t open more than a finger’s width. You can force it, but not quietly.

You test it again, harder. The wood flexes and gives a tiny squeal.

Outside—close now, on the other side of that wall—you hear movement, like someone positioning under the window line. A shadow passes across the filthy glass, blocking what little light there is.

Back at the door, the lock work stops. You hear metal being set down, then a different sound: the scrape of something heavy being lifted into position.

Threat: they’re about to **breach the storage door by force** (ram or shoulder), and someone has moved to **cover the window** from outside, ready to grab or strike if you break it.

### Turn 118 [PLAYER]

I drop off the crate and whisper to Rusk, “Stay still—no noise. If they come in, don’t shoot unless I say.” 

I scan the shelves fast for a back door, cellar hatch, or service crawlspace, and if I spot none, I drag a heavy shelf sideways to create a choke point facing the storage door, then take a low position off to the hinge side with my blade ready—out of the direct line of the breach. “You know my name,” I call softly at the door. “Then you know I don’t open for men who gas a room. What do you want?”

*Agent reasoning: The window’s covered and booby-stopped, so forcing it is a trap. The door breach is imminent; I need a position of advantage, a distraction, and a quieter escape route if one exists. I’ll check for an interior back exit while setting an ambush angle and keeping Rusk hidden and breathing high.*

### Turn 119 [GAME]

Rusk nods once, tight and miserable, and wedges himself deeper behind the shelves. He keeps his pistol down but his knuckles are white on the grip. The gas under the door is still only a thin, floor-hugging ribbon in here, but it’s enough to make his eyes shine and his breathing hitch.

You sweep the storage room fast: stacked crates, a rail of hooks, a narrow aisle to a back wall of damp brick. No back door. No hatch. No obvious crawlspace—just a floor drain and a patch of newer mortar where someone’s repaired the wall. The high window is the only light and it’s controlled from outside.

You put your shoulder into a heavy shelving unit and drag it sideways. It scrapes loud, metal feet chattering on concrete. You angle it so anyone coming through the storage door has to funnel around the shelf edge. You drop low on the hinge side, hook-blade ready, out of the straight line where a rush or a gun would naturally point.

At the door, you hear the heavy thing settle—wood on concrete—then a grunt as they adjust their grip.

You call out.

A beat. Then the calm voice answers, closer to the door than before, still muffled like he’s speaking through cloth: “We want the officer. That’s all.”

Another voice—impatient, rougher—cuts in: “And the notebook, if you’ve got it.”

The calm one continues, as if correcting a subordinate without saying so: “You walked into a bad room, Marrow. You can walk out. Slide him out and we’ll leave you breathing.”

You hear a quick, urgent whisper between them, right outside: “Hinge side. She’s smart.”

Then the breach starts—not a full ram yet, but a test hit: *WHAM* into the door, hard enough to make the deadbolt plate groan and the door shudder in its frame. Dust shakes off the top shelf. Rusk flinches and clamps his mouth shut to keep from coughing.

Threat is immediate and specific: they’re escalating to **forced entry** through the storage door; if the bolt or frame fails, they’ll come through fast and low, and they’ve stated their target is **Rusk** (and possibly your notebook/patterns).

### Turn 120 [PLAYER]

“Officer’s not for sale,” I call, steady, buying breath. “And you’re not getting my book—so tell me who you work for before you start breaking bones.”

I motion Rusk to stay put, then creep to the patch of newer mortar and press along it with my fingertips and the hook-blade tip, probing for a seam, hollow, or loose brick—something that gives. With my free hand I quietly drag a crate into the funnel gap by the door so the first man through has to trip or climb, and I settle back low on the hinge side, blade ready for the moment the frame gives.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to breach; I need time and another exit. The patched mortar might hide a crawl or weak point, and talking can stall while I set a trap at the door’s funnel.*

### Turn 121 [GAME]

Your words land on the other side of the door and get answered with a short, humorless exhale.

“Not for sale,” the calm voice repeats, like he’s tasting it. “That’s cute.”

The rougher one doesn’t bother with talk. You hear him shift his stance—boots scuffing for traction—then the real hit comes.

*WHAM.*

The door bucks in its frame. The deadbolt holds, but the strike plate screams; a splinter pops somewhere near the jamb. The shelving you dragged shivers, metal rattling against glass jars.

You motion Rusk down again; he stays put, eyes wide, trying to swallow his coughs.

You slide to the newer mortar patch. Up close it’s not just “fresh”—it’s sloppy, like a rush job: mortar smeared a little over brick faces, sandier than the older work. You probe with the hook-blade tip.

On the third press, the tip sinks a hair too easily. Not brick—void. You scrape gently and a thin line of mortar flakes away, revealing the edge of something set into the wall: a narrow iron panel, about the width of a ledger book, mortared over to disappear. There’s a faint seam at the bottom.

It’s not opening on its own, but it’s *real*—a service access or old chute cover someone didn’t want found.

You drag a crate into the funnel by the door. “Quietly” isn’t in the cards: it grinds and thumps once as it catches on the floor drain. Still, it sits where you want it—first step inside becomes a stumble or a climb.

Outside, the calm voice stops negotiating. “On three,” he says, low.

You hear them reposition—one man close to the latch side, another farther back with the ram. Then:

“One.”

Gas continues to feather under the door, thicker now; it curls around the crate legs and starts pooling in the lowest aisle.

“Two.”

Rusk’s breathing turns sharp and panicked behind the shelves.

“Th—”

The ram hits before “three” finishes.

*WHAM—CRACK.*

The doorframe gives a little this time. The deadbolt is still in, but the wood around the strike plate splits enough to show a bright, raw line. One more like that and the bolt may tear free with the frame.

Immediate threat: **breach is imminent**; if they get the door open, the first man through will be funneled into your crate-and-shelf choke point, but they’re coming fast and armed, and the gas is now **building inside** the room.

### Turn 122 [PLAYER]

I hiss to Rusk, “Up high—on the shelves if you can. Don’t breathe low,” then jam the hook-blade into the seam of the iron panel and pry hard, using a crate as leverage under my boot. If it cracks open, I shove it wide enough to get fingers in and pull, then wave Rusk over: “Here—move, now,” keeping my body between him and the door as the next hit comes.

*Agent reasoning: The door’s about to fail and the gas is rising; fighting two armed men in a confined room is a bad bet. The iron access panel is the only new escape route—worth forcing immediately while the choke point buys seconds.*

### Turn 123 [GAME]

Rusk nods hard, coughing once despite himself, and hauls himself up onto the lower shelf rung. He gets his face higher, away from the worst of the floor-hugging gas, boots scraping metal. He keeps the pistol, but he’s trying to make himself small.

You drive the hook-blade into the iron panel’s bottom seam. It bites with a metallic *tink* and skates—paint and mortar dust—then catches. You brace a boot on the crate edge and pry.

The seam gives with a brittle crack as the mortar lip fractures. Your shoulder and forearm burn; the panel flexes a fraction, then pops inward with a dull *clunk* like a latch finally surrendering.

At the door:

*WHAM.*

The frame splinters again. The deadbolt is still engaged, but the strike-side wood is now chewed open; you can see a sliver of the bolt through the torn jamb. They’re one solid hit from ripping it free.

You wrench the panel wider. It opens like a narrow service hatch, swinging inward on stiff hinges. A breath of colder air spills out—damp, old-stone cold—and with it the stink of stagnant water and rust.

Inside is not a clean passage. It’s a vertical drop of about three feet into a tight brick-lined service run—wide enough for a person turned sideways—leading off into darkness. You can hear water somewhere below, slow dripping, and the faint tremor of traffic through the masonry.

You get your fingers in and pull it as wide as it will go. The opening is just barely man-sized, and the lower edge is sharp with broken mortar.

You wave Rusk over. He starts to climb down from the shelf, moving too fast, panic in him now.

Then the calm voice outside calls, sharp: “She found the panel—window side! Shoot the hinges if it opens!”

A shadow crosses the high window again, and something metallic taps the glass from outside—someone lining up.

The next hit comes immediately.

*WHAM—SNAP.*

The deadbolt tears partway through the softened wood. The door doesn’t fly open yet, but it lurches inward an inch, held by the remaining splinters and the warped bolt. Through the gap you see oilskin knees and the dull black nose of a pistol probing for angle.

Threat, clear: in seconds they can force the door fully; there’s a gun already fishing through the gap, and someone outside is ready to fire toward the hatch/window side if they get a sightline. The hatch is open, but it’s a cramped, sharp-edged drop into a dark service run—easy to snag, easy to get stuck if you rush.

### Turn 124 [PLAYER]

“Rusk—down the hatch, now. Head low, gun away, don’t snag.”  

I slap the hatch edge to guide him, then hiss toward the door, “He’s not here—check the window!” As the pistol noses in, I kick the crate into the door’s gap to jam their entry and spoil their angle, then duck through the hatch after Rusk, pulling the iron panel as closed as I can from the inside.

*Agent reasoning: They’re seconds from bursting in and already probing with a gun; the hatch is our only exit. I need Rusk moving first while I block sightlines and buy a heartbeat with misdirection, then follow immediately—no heroics, just survive.*

### Turn 125 [GAME]

Rusk doesn’t argue. He shoves the pistol into his waistband like it burns him, turns sideways, and drops into the service run feet-first. His shoulder catches the broken mortar edge; fabric tears with a sharp rip and he hisses through his teeth, but he keeps moving, hunched, head low like you ordered. He lands awkwardly in shallow, slick water—ankle-deep—and stumbles forward to make room.

You slap the hatch edge, then throw your lie at the door: “He’s not here—check the window!”

Outside, the calm voice snaps, “Don’t—” but the rougher one is already committed. The pistol noses through the gap, searching.

You kick the crate.

It slams into the door’s inch-wide opening and wedges hard against the warped bolt and splintered jamb. The pistol jerks back as the crate bites. For a heartbeat the choke holds—wood grinding on wood, the door stuck half-chewed open but not advancing.

“Shit—she jammed it!” the rough voice barks.

You duck into the hatch after Rusk. The drop scrapes your shins; the brick is wet and greasy. Your boots hit water with a cold slap. The air down here is worse in a different way—mold, iron, old urine, and something chemical that makes your throat sting.

Behind you, you haul the iron panel toward closed. It swings most of the way, but the broken mortar lip keeps it from seating flush. You get it nearly shut—enough that from the storage room it looks like a dark seam again.

Then the shot comes.

Not from the door—too jammed for a clean angle—but from above: the high window. Glass pops and rains down in tinkling shards onto the storage floor. A second shot follows, *clang*ing off something metal inside the room.

The calm voice: “Find the hatch. Now.”

You hear the crate being dragged, then kicked free; the door finally groans wider as they muscle past the jam. Boots thud into the storage room. A flashlight beam sweeps, briefly knifing through the hatch seam—close enough that a thin line of light cuts into the service run.

Rusk is already moving in the dark, one hand on the wall, trying not to splash. He whispers, ragged: “Which way—?”

Threat is immediate: two armed men are **in the storage room** and actively **searching for the hatch**, with at least one shooter positioned at the **window**. You’ve gained a few seconds, not safety, and the service run is narrow, wet, and echoing—noise will carry.

### Turn 126 [PLAYER]

I grab Rusk’s sleeve and whisper, “Wait—listen.” I hold still for a beat, feeling for any draft or hearing street noise, then point the way that seems to carry airflow and guide him forward with a hand on the wall. As we move, I keep my steps tight and slow to avoid splashing, blade in my right hand, and I murmur, “If they crack that hatch, kill your breath and don’t run—just freeze.”

*Agent reasoning: We need distance fast, but quietly; sound carries and they’ve got a flashlight line on the seam. I’ll choose the direction that feels like it leads to airflow/exit, minimize splashing, and be ready to misdirect if they open the panel.*

### Turn 127 [GAME]

You clamp a hand on Rusk’s sleeve and both of you go statue-still in the brick slit. The water around your boots settles from ripples to a faint tremble.

Above and behind, the storage room is a muffled storm: a shelf scrapes, a jar breaks, a man swears under his breath. A flashlight beam skates across the hatch seam again—brighter this time, steadier—then disappears.

You tilt your head, hunting for something honest: a draft, street noise, anything that tells you which way isn’t a dead end. On your left, the air is stale and warmer, the stink of rot stronger. On your right, there’s a thin, colder pull across your cheek—faint but real—and with it a far-off, metallic hum like a transformer or a streetlamp ballast. You point right.

You guide Rusk forward, one hand on the wall, moving tight and slow. Each step is a careful roll of the foot to keep the water from slapping. Even so, Rusk’s boot clips something submerged—tin or glass—and it gives a small, traitorous *clink*.

Up above, instantly: “Hold up,” the calm voice says. “You hear that? Down in the wall.”

A pause. The kind where men decide whether they’re imagining things.

Then: a hard knock on brick, close to the hatch—someone rapping the wall with the butt of a tool, listening for hollow. Another knock, closer to where the panel is mortared over.

“Here,” the rough voice says. “This patch—fresh.”

Metal grinds against masonry: they’ve got something—crowbar or chisel—worrying at the mortar from the storage-room side.

You keep moving. The cold draft strengthens as the run bends slightly; the brick under your left hand changes—slicker, with a strip of old mortar like a repair line. Ahead, the passage tightens for a few feet, then you see a darker vertical seam: a junction where the run meets an older conduit, narrower but drier.

Behind you, a sharp *crack*—mortar breaking free. The iron panel doesn’t open yet, but it shifts with a dull, transmitted vibration through the bricks you’re touching.

Rusk’s breathing goes shallow as you murmur your instruction. He nods once, eyes wide in the dark.

Threat is now specific and closing: they’ve identified the fresh patch and are actively prying the hatch open. If the panel swings, their flashlight will rake the run and they’ll have a straight line for a shot into this narrow corridor.

### Turn 128 [PLAYER]

I tug Rusk toward the darker seam. “Into the narrow—now. Sideways.”  

Once he’s through, I slip in after him and ease the blade out to score the wet brick at the junction—just enough to loosen grit and make a slick patch—then we press flat and still just inside the tighter conduit, lights off, listening for the hatch to swing.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to pop the hatch and this corridor becomes a shooting lane. Better to break line-of-sight and get into the narrower, drier conduit; if we must, set a quiet ambush at the choke rather than run splashing.*

### Turn 129 [GAME]

Rusk squeezes into the narrower conduit sideways, shoulders scraping brick. It’s drier in there—no ankle-water—but the air is tighter, dustier, with that old-stone taste that coats the back of your tongue. He shuffles two steps in and presses himself flat against the right wall, making a gap for you.

You slip in after him, turning your hips to clear. Your coat drags grit off the brick with a soft rasp. At the junction, you take the hook-blade and score the wet brick where the two passages meet—shallow cuts, just enough to crumble the softened mortar skin. The surface turns to slick paste under the blade, gritty mud that smears and drops in clumps onto the floor where the run narrows.

You and Rusk go still, flattened just inside the tighter conduit.

Behind you, the hatch finally gives.

A scrape—metal on brick—then a harsher sound as the iron panel is forced inward. Cold air rushes through the opened seam like a sigh. A flashlight snaps on and a hard white beam stabs into the service run, sweeping low.

“Down here,” the rough voice says, close now, echoing. “I got a hole.”

Bootsteps splash into the run—one man commits. You hear him testing footing, then moving fast, thinking you ran.

The slick patch does what you meant it to. His next step hits your freshly loosened grit at the junction; his boot skates. He catches himself with a palm slap on the wall, but his knee bangs the brick with a hollow *thunk* and he swears, loud.

“Careful—” the calm voice calls from above, and the beam wobbles.

The slip buys you a half-second, not a disappearance. The man in the run recovers and pushes forward anyway, now slower, flashlight angling toward the junction—toward the darker seam you used.

The light begins to creep across the junction line. If it swings another foot, it’ll rake into the narrow conduit and paint you and Rusk flat against the wall.

Rusk’s breath stops on its own, eyes locked on the oncoming glow. Your blade is in your right hand; there’s barely room to swing in this conduit, and no room to pass each other.

Threat, immediate: an armed searcher is advancing in the service run with a flashlight and likely a pistol; he’s about to clear the junction and get a direct sightline into your hiding place.

### Turn 130 [PLAYER]

I press my lips to Rusk’s ear: “On my touch—back up, slow. No noise.”  

As the flashlight edge creeps toward the seam, I flick my hook-blade out low and slap-swipe at the beam hand from the dark—aiming to knock the light into the wet run—then immediately pull back and shuffle deeper into the narrow conduit, keeping my shoulder to the wall and dragging Rusk with me.

*Agent reasoning: If the beam hits us, it’s over. I can’t fight cleanly in this tight space, so I need to steal his light and balance at the junction, then vanish deeper while he’s disoriented.*

### Turn 131 [GAME]

Rusk gives the tiniest nod you can feel through his coat. He starts to edge backward, careful, heel-to-toe in the dry grit.

The flashlight’s glow thickens at the junction seam—then your hook-blade snakes out low from the dark.

You connect.

Steel clips knuckles instead of the lamp body. The man yelps—sharp, involuntary—and the flashlight jerks. It bounces off the brick lip and drops into the wet run with a loud *clack-splash*, beam spinning wild across water and wall like a lighthouse gone mad.

But you paid for it: the hook-blade bites skin. Not deep, but enough to draw. You feel the blade snag for a fraction of a second on something—glove seam or a ring—before you rip it back.

“CONTACT!” the man shouts, voice cracking with pain and adrenaline. His other hand comes up fast; you hear the unmistakable rasp of a pistol clearing leather.

A shot detonates in the tight space. The muzzle flash blooms against brick; the crack punches your ears flat. The round smacks the junction edge—brick chips sting your cheek—and the ricochet whines down the run.

Above, the calm voice is suddenly all command: “Light’s down—DON’T FIRE BLIND—” too late. “Get in there. Now.”

Boots hit the run behind him: a second man drops in, splashing hard, moving on the sound. The fallen flashlight continues to spin in the water, beam strobing the junction every half-turn—brief, brutal flashes that threaten to catch your outline.

You yank back into the narrow conduit, shoulder scraping, dragging Rusk by the sleeve. He backsteps as instructed, but he can’t help a small grunt as his hip catches a brick nub.

The injured man at the junction slaps a hand against the wall, feeling for your seam. “Right here—she’s in the side cut!” He’s close enough now that his fingers rake the edge of the conduit mouth.

Immediate threat: one armed man is at the junction, pistol up, reaching into your entrance; a second is rushing up the wet run behind him. The dropped flashlight is intermittently lighting the conduit mouth, and another blind shot in this brick throat could hit you or Rusk even without a clear sightline.

### Turn 132 [PLAYER]

I grab Rusk’s collar and haul him deeper, whispering, “Move—no talking.” As the flashlight beam swings away, I shove a loose brick/stone from the conduit edge down into the junction and smear more slick grit at the lip, then retreat fast but controlled, keeping my blade up and my body between Rusk and the entrance. “If he comes in, you crawl past me—don’t stand.”

*Agent reasoning: They’ve got the entrance and a pistol; fighting in this tube is suicide. Best move is to break their line of sight, slow them, and get distance—quietly—before they commit further. Use the strobing light against them and leave a nasty surprise at the mouth.*

### Turn 133 [GAME]

You fist Rusk by the collar and haul him another yard down the narrow conduit. He stumbles, catches himself on the wall, and goes low the way you told him—hands and knees, breath held.

The flashlight in the wet run keeps spinning. When its beam swings away, you dart back to the mouth. The conduit edge has a half-loosened brick—more a broken chunk than a clean brick. You wrench it free with a muted grind and shove it down into the junction.

It hits the slick, wet lip you already ruined and skitters instead of wedging—clacks the wall, drops into the ankle-water with a splash, and floats the flashlight beam for a second as it bumps the light. The beam stutters, then continues its slow, nauseating spin.

You smear more loosened grit at the lip anyway, making the entry a treacherous little ramp.

At the junction, the armed man’s fingers find air where the brick used to be. He curses and jabs his pistol toward the conduit mouth, not quite committing his head and shoulders yet. “She’s right—”

His boot steps to follow his hand.

The slick takes him harder this time. His foot slides out; his shin slams the brick edge with a sharp crack and he goes down on one knee in the water, catching himself on the wall. The pistol discharges as he falls—another deafening blast. The round punches into the conduit mouth and chips brick inches from where your hand just was. Dust puffs into your face; a hot sting grazes your knuckles.

“Christ—!” he snarls, now angry and hurt, not careful anymore.

The second man reaches the junction behind him, crowding in the wet run. “Move, I got you—” He grabs the first man by the coat and tries to haul him back up, but the tight space turns them into a tangle.

Above, from the storage room, a third voice barks down—different timbre, older: “Stop shooting! I want her alive. Get a lantern down there—now!”

You retreat fast but controlled, blade up, body between Rusk and the entrance. Rusk crawls backward deeper, scraping elbows, doing exactly what you told him.

Immediate threat is still at the mouth: two men are jammed at the junction, one armed and now firing uncontrolled in a confined brick throat. Their next move is likely to switch tactics—bring steady light (a lantern) and/or fire into the conduit to flush you.

### Turn 134 [PLAYER]

I grab the back of Rusk’s belt and hurry him deeper on hands-and-knees, whispering, “Find me a bend, a grate, anything—don’t stop.” As we go, I pause just long enough to feel along the wall for any side seam or ladder rungs, then keep moving, keeping us in the dark and putting as much brick between us and that junction as I can.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to bring a lantern and take their time; staying near the mouth is a death sentence. I need distance, a second exit, or a choke point we can actually defend—quietly. Also Rusk panics if I don’t keep him moving.*

### Turn 135 [GAME]

You hook two fingers in the back of Rusk’s belt and urge him forward. He crawls fast but quiet, palms sliding over dust and old lime. Your whisper gets a tight nod; he doesn’t answer.

You move in short bursts: crawl, stop, listen; crawl, stop, feel. The conduit stays narrow enough that your shoulders brush both sides if you breathe too big. Brick gives way to older stone in places—rougher, damp-seeping, cold.

You pause and run your fingertips along the right wall: patches of flaking mortar, a hairline crack—then metal. Not rungs. A seam: a thin iron strip mortared into the wall like a frame, cold and slightly proud of the stone. You find a latch plate… but no handle, and the seam is packed with grit like it hasn’t been opened in years. It’s a side access door, but it’s sealed hard.

You keep moving.

Behind you, the junction noise shifts. The uncontrolled gunfire stops. Boots slosh, then retreat a step. A voice—muffled by distance but carrying in the tube—barks: “Lantern! And a hook—she’s in the side run!”

Then something new: metal scraping on brick, steady and deliberate, like they’re dragging a tool along the wall to find the mouth again.

Rusk suddenly freezes and points ahead with a shaking finger.

The conduit bends—hard left—about ten feet ahead. Past the bend you can’t see anything, but you can smell it: stagnant water and something sour-sweet underneath, like rot trapped in a jar. The floor dips slightly toward the bend.

As you crawl, your knee finds a slick patch you didn’t expect. The dust here is damp, almost greasy. Rusk’s hand slips; he catches himself with a soft slap.

The bend is real cover—brick between you and their light—but the dip means any lantern glow might still wash around the corner if they advance far enough, and the slick patch could betray you again with noise if you rush.

Immediate threat: the searchers have stopped firing and are switching to controlled pursuit with steady light and tools, and they’re still close enough that you can hear them preparing to push into the conduit.

### Turn 136 [PLAYER]

I squeeze Rusk’s shoulder. “Slow—use your elbows, keep your weight low.” We crawl to the hard left bend and tuck just past it, then I quietly drag a couple loose stones/grit into a little ridge at the corner to make the floor treacherous without making a clatter. 

I press my ear to the wall, listening for their lantern and footsteps, then feel back along that iron-framed side seam for any way to pry it—hinge gap, latch play—keeping my voice to a breath: “If I tap twice, you keep crawling. Don’t wait for me.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re regrouping with better light and tools, so we need distance and cover fast. The hard bend is our best chance to break line-of-sight, but the dip and slick could make noise; I’ll move carefully, then use the bend to set a quiet, simple obstacle and check if that sealed side door can be forced as a fallback.*

### Turn 137 [GAME]

Rusk nods once, jaw clenched, and switches to elbows like you told him—quiet, ugly progress. You both make the hard left and tuck just past it. The bend buys you a slab of brick between your bodies and the junction.

You rake your fingers through the damp grit at the corner and pull a couple thumb-sized stones into a low ridge where the floor dips—enough to catch a boot and turn an ankle, not enough to sound like construction. It holds.

You press your ear to the wall. At first it’s just water drip and your own blood moving.

Then: a lantern being coaxed to life—faint *tink-tink* of glass, a soft *whoomph* as a wick catches. The light itself you can’t see yet, but you can hear the men change how they move: slower, deliberate, careful with their footing now.

A voice carries down the conduit, closer than you want. The older one again, controlled: “No more shots. You see her, you call it. You don’t lunge.”

Another voice, the one you nicked, wet with rage and pain: “She cut me. I’m going in.”

Boots start into the conduit. Not running—probing. The lantern’s chain gives a tiny rhythmic jingle between steps.

You feel back along the iron-framed side seam. Up close, it’s worse than you hoped: the mortar has been packed into the frame edge like someone intentionally sealed it. You find a hinge line—two iron knuckles buried under grit—but there’s no gap you can get a fingertip into. The latch plate has the faint outline of a keyway… but it’s clogged and crusted over. You test it with a nail; it doesn’t give.

As you’re feeling it out, the lantern glow begins to wash around the bend in weak pulses—reflected off wet brick, not direct. They’re within a few yards of the corner now.

A boot scuffs, then stops. The man in front has seen something—your disturbed grit ridge, maybe, or the change in floor. He doesn’t step onto it.

He lowers his voice. “Corner ahead.”

The lantern chain goes still. For a beat, nobody moves.

Then metal scrapes softly—like a hooked tool being extended along the floor toward the bend, feeling for the ridge and anything beyond it. If that hook catches your ankle, your coat, or Rusk’s belt, they’ll have you without ever stepping around the corner.

No change to inventory or known NPC roster.

### Turn 138 [PLAYER]

I tap Rusk twice and point deeper. “Go. Keep crawling.”

I stay just at the bend and, as the hook scrapes around, I pin it to the floor with my boot and use the hook-blade to catch and yank it hard sideways into the ridge so it clatters and binds—then I let go and crawl after Rusk fast, staying low and silent.

*Agent reasoning: The hook tool is the immediate threat; if it snags us we’re done. I need to neutralize it quietly and buy space without exposing Rusk, then keep moving toward any secondary exit.*

### Turn 139 [GAME]

Two taps on Rusk’s shoulder. He doesn’t look back—just nods and keeps crawling into the dark, elbows and knees whispering over damp stone.

You plant your boot at the bend as the hook noses around the corner, metal teeth skating the greasy patch. The moment you feel its pull, you stomp down and catch it. With your other hand you snag the shaft with your hook-blade and wrench hard, sideways, aiming for the little ridge you built.

It works—too well.

The hook jams into the stones and bites brick. It *clatters* sharp as cutlery in a sink, then goes tight with a vibrating twang as someone on the other end yanks back.

Instant reaction: the lantern swings, and a broad yellow fan of light slaps the bend and spills farther than before. Your boot and blade throw hard shadows.

“Contact!” the injured man barks, voice right there.

The line goes taut again—your boot skids a half inch on the slick, but you keep it pinned long enough to let go. You release and crawl, fast, hugging the floor. Behind you, the hook scrapes free with a grinding pop and whips back out of sight.

A boot immediately steps onto your grit ridge—exactly where you wanted it. There’s a short, ugly yelp and a heavy stumble. The man catches himself against the wall, but the lantern swings wildly, throwing light in frantic arcs that chase you for a second down the conduit.

“There!” he spits, breathless. “She’s moving!”

Then the older voice, harsh and close: “Don’t go alone—keep the light steady!”

You gain distance, but not cleanly: the lantern has your direction now, and they’re committed. You hear them reorganize—one man steadying the lantern, the other dragging the hook back into position. Their boots resume, careful but faster, sloshing through the dip.

Ahead, Rusk is a darker shape in darker dark. He glances back once, eyes wide, then keeps crawling.

Threat is immediate and specific: they’ve confirmed your position and are pursuing with a steady lantern and the hooked tool, closing from behind down a narrow conduit with no visible side exits.

### Turn 140 [PLAYER]

I hiss to Rusk, “Don’t look back—count your turns. First opening, we take it.” Keeping low, I crawl fast while sweeping my left hand along the wall for any seam, rung, or change in airflow; if I find even a cracked access panel, I’ll jam my hook-blade in and pry it enough for Rusk to slip through first. If there’s no exit in the next few yards, I stop at the next bend or narrowing and pull to the side, ready to slash the hook line the moment it snakes around the corner again.

*Agent reasoning: We can’t outrun a lantern and hook in a straight narrow tube; we need cover or an exit. I’ll keep moving but prioritize finding any side break, vertical access, or widening where we can ambush or slip past—without getting pinned in dead-end darkness.*

### Turn 141 [GAME]

Rusk keeps crawling without another glance, shoulders tight, counting under his breath like a prayer you can’t quite hear.

You put on speed, left hand skating the wall: wet stone, flaked mortar, a run of old brick, then—cold metal again. Not a full door this time: a narrow vertical seam, iron set into the masonry like a service slit. You feel a faint draft through it, cooler and less sour than the conduit air.

You jam the hook-blade’s tip into the seam and lever.

The first pry does nothing.

The second pry pops something inside with a dull *tock*—and the seam opens a finger’s width. A dry shower of grit falls. The draft strengthens, carrying a different smell: dust and old paper, like a sealed room.

“Here,” you hiss, and shove the opening wider.

It widens grudgingly—then stops hard, as if a chain or internal bar catches. Wide enough for a hand… not wide enough for Rusk’s shoulders. Rusk tries anyway, twisting, sucking in his ribs; the iron edge bites his coat and he makes a small involuntary grunt of pain.

Behind you, the lantern light is stronger now, steady—no wild swinging. They learned.

“Hook forward,” the older one orders, calm as a clerk. “Keep it low.”

The hooked tool scrapes closer, more controlled, and you hear a new sound under it: a line paying out—rope or cable—soft rasp against brick.

You abandon the prying and drag Rusk back into motion. “Not this,” you breathe, and push him onward.

Ten feet ahead the conduit narrows slightly where a supporting arch pinches the walls—no bend, but a choke point. You flatten to the side just before it, giving Rusk space to slip past, and ready your hook-blade.

The hook arrives a heartbeat later, snaking around the narrow arch, teeth searching the floor.

You slash at the line.

Your blade bites—sparks flick off stone—and the line *doesn’t* part. It’s not hemp. It’s thin wire-cable with a cloth wrap, and it whips under the cut, stinging your knuckles. The hook jerks back hard, then lunges forward again, now aimed higher—at waist and shoulder height—trying to snag flesh or clothing, not just ankles.

The lantern is close enough that your shadow is visible on the wall ahead of you. They’re within a few yards, and they’ve switched from probing to active snaring with a cable that won’t cut easily.

### Turn 142 [PLAYER]

I snap, “Rusk—keep going. Don’t stop unless I grab you.”  

As the hook lunges high, I duck and jam my hook-blade into the wire wrap near the hook head, twisting to snag and foul it, then I throw my weight sideways and down, trying to wedge the hook against the narrowing so it can’t retract cleanly. The second I feel it bind, I crawl hard back toward that iron service slit and start prying again—quiet but brutal—trying to pop whatever internal bar/chain is stopping it so Rusk can get through.

*Agent reasoning: The wire-cable won’t cut fast, so I need to break their leverage and buy distance—either by fouling the hook or forcing them to stop at the choke point. The partially-open service slit is a potential fallback, but it’s too tight for Rusk right now. I’ll use the narrow arch to trap the hook, then retreat and try the slit again with more force once they’re delayed.*

### Turn 143 [GAME]

“Rusk—keep going. Don’t stop unless I grab you.”

He does. You hear his knees and elbows fade ahead, faster now, ragged breathing kept behind his teeth.

The hook lunges high. You duck under it and slam your hook-blade into the cloth-wrapped cable right behind the hook head, twisting hard. The blade catches the wrap and bites into the wire’s grooves—not cutting, but fouling. When you throw your weight sideways and down, the hook head slams into the narrowing arch with a sharp *clang* and wedges for half a second.

That half second costs them.

The injured man yanks and the cable doesn’t give cleanly; it saws against brick and your blade. The older one snaps, “Hold—hold the light—” and the lantern steadies, bathing the choke point in yellow.

Then the injured man changes tactics: he surges forward instead of pulling back. Boots splash, coat scrapes stone, and he drives the hook shaft with both hands like a spear to un-wedge it.

Your hook-blade skitters, ripping your palm as the cloth wrap tears. The hook pops free with a violent jerk. The sudden release pitches you onto your side and you slam a shoulder into the wall.

You scramble backward toward the iron service slit.

They’re on you now: the lantern is at arm’s length around the narrowing, and you finally see them—two Harbor “safety men” in oilskins, faces half-hidden by brims, one with a fresh bloody bandage at his forearm. The older one’s eyes flick to the slit the moment you do.

“Door,” he says, flat. “She’s got a door.”

You jam the hook-blade back into the slit seam and pry—quiet isn’t an option anymore. Iron shrieks against masonry. The seam opens a hair more… and stops on the same internal catch.

From the other side of the slit, something answers your force with a dull metallic rattle: a short chain, tensioned.

The older man steps in, reaches down, and produces a compact bolt-cutter from his coat like it’s part of the uniform. He doesn’t go for you first—he goes for the slit.

“Pin her,” he tells the injured one.

The injured man advances, hook raised again, angling to snag your leg or belt and drag you away from the slit. The threat is immediate: one is about to grab you with the hook at close range while the other prepares to cut through the slit’s chain—either to open it for himself or to deny it to you.

### Turn 144 [PLAYER]

I shove a handful of wet grit up and into the lantern’s flame and glass as I lunge low, trying to snuff or at least fog it, then I slash the injured man’s hook-hand/shaft to knock it off-line and dive for his legs—using the slick floor to slide past him toward the darker stretch Rusk took. “You cut that chain and you’ll be crawling out blind,” I hiss at the older one as I scramble away.

*Agent reasoning: I can’t win a close grapple in a tunnel, and if they get the slit open they’ll have the advantage. Best move is to blind/disrupt the lantern and force space, then either slip past or buy seconds for Rusk; I’ll use the wet grit and my hook-blade to create a momentary opening without committing to a lethal fight.*

### Turn 145 [GAME]

You scoop a fistful of wet grit and fling it up into the lantern as you lunge.

It doesn’t snuff—oil flame’s stubborn—but it does what you need: the grit spatters the hot glass and chimney, instantly baking into a smeary film. The light drops from a clean beam to a muddy, flickering glow. The older man jerks the lantern back, swearing as grit pings off the metal hood.

“—Christ—!”

In the same motion you slash at the injured man’s hook-hand and the shaft. Your blade bites leather and catches the oilskin cuff; he yelps and reflexively pulls back. The hook doesn’t get you—but the shaft swings wide, clanging off the wall.

You dive low at his legs, using the slick floor like a chute. Your shoulder hits his shins and he stumbles, trying to brace. For a second you’re under him, sliding past—

—and then his boot comes down hard on the back of your coat near the shoulder seam. Not a pin, but a stomp meant to catch fabric. The coat jerks; you feel the collar bite your throat. You still wriggle free, but it costs you speed and air.

You scramble toward the darker stretch where Rusk went, coughing, coat half-twisted.

Behind you the older man answers your hiss without looking at you. He’s already decided. “Then you shouldn’t have shown me the door.”

The bolt-cutter snaps once—metal on metal—followed by the unmistakable *clink* of a short chain going slack. The iron slit gives a fraction, like it wants to open.

The injured man, breathing hard, barks, “She’s getting away!”

“Let her,” the older one says, and you hear him shift his weight toward the slit. “You. After the cop.”

That splits the threat in two: one man commits to pursuing you into the dark, hook back in his hands and now moving fast despite the slick; the other stays at the service slit, working it open with the ruined lantern light close to his chest—either to bring more men through later or to cut off your route if you double back.

Ahead, in the darkness, you catch a brief sound from Rusk—an abrupt scrape and a muffled curse—like he’s hit a drop or a tight turn and nearly lost it.

### Turn 146 [PLAYER]

I whisper hard, “Rusk—talk to me. Drop? Left or right?” then I grab a loose stone and whip it back down the tunnel to make a false clatter farther behind me. I crawl to the edge of the dark spot where he cursed, feel ahead with my hand for a lip or ladder, and press myself flat to the wall just before it—hook-blade ready to catch the pursuer’s cable if it comes around.

*Agent reasoning: Rusk may be hurt or stuck ahead, and I can’t let the pursuer close the distance with that hook. I need to slow him without getting cornered, then get eyes on Rusk and whatever caused the stumble—likely a drop or side junction we can use.*

### Turn 147 [GAME]

“Rusk—talk to me. Drop? Left or right?”

For a beat there’s only the drip and your own breath. Then, from ahead, Rusk forces out a whisper like it hurts to make sound.

“Drop. Two… two feet. Then left—hard left. Pipe—don’t—” He sucks air. “—don’t grab the pipe.”

You find a loose chunk of brick at the wall base and whip it back the way you came. It skips and clatters, then you hear it tumble into a shallow puddle farther back with a satisfying *splash-scrape-scrape* that sounds like a body scrambling.

The pursuer reacts immediately. Boots scuff fast on stone; the hook scrapes, then lifts. “There—!” he blurts, voice snapping toward the noise.

He commits for a second—then checks himself, listening. The tunnel carries sound too well. He’s not stupid. “No,” he mutters, and you hear him angle forward again, quicker, hook low.

You crawl to where Rusk cursed and reach out into the dark with your left hand.

Your fingers find the lip: the conduit floor breaks into a short drop, about two feet, with a slick edge that’s been worn rounded. Past it, the passage kinks sharply left. On the right wall at the corner there’s a corroded pipe running along the bend—wet, slimy, and slightly loose in its mounts. When you touch near it, it shivers faintly, and you feel why Rusk warned you: it isn’t solid enough to take weight.

You press yourself flat against the wall just before the drop, hook-blade up and ready, making yourself small.

The pursuer arrives at the choke. His lantern-less silhouette is a darker shape against the faint, dirty glow behind him. He slows at the edge, hook hand up, listening for breath.

Then he does something worse than rushing: he lowers the hook head over the lip and lets it hang, cable paying out quietly. He’s fishing the drop and the left turn by feel, trying to snag whatever’s below without exposing himself.

The hook head swings once… twice… and starts drifting toward the pipe at the corner. If it catches that loose pipe, it’ll clang and possibly tear free—noise that gives you away *and* could block the bend.

You have a moment: the hook/cable is within reach, and the pipe is about to get involved.

### Turn 148 [PLAYER]

I reach out and catch the cable just above the hook head, gloved hand clamping tight to stop its swing, then I wrap it once around my hook-blade and twist to bind it against the lip. Keeping my body flat and silent, I ease the hook down and wedge it under the ledge so it snags stone—not the pipe—then I slip over the drop and take the hard left after Rusk.

*Agent reasoning: If the hook catches the loose pipe, it’ll make noise and possibly trap me at the bend. Better to control the hook now—quietly—by fouling and anchoring it, buying time to drop and follow Rusk.*

### Turn 149 [GAME]

Your hand shoots out and clamps the cable just above the hook head.

For an instant it works—swing killed dead, the line going taut through your fist. The wire’s wet and gritty, and it bites through your glove seams like teeth. You keep your body pinned flat and don’t give him the satisfaction of a sound.

You loop the cable once around your hook-blade and twist, using the lip as a brace. The wire creaks. The hook head dips under your control, and you guide it down toward the stone under-ledge instead of the loose pipe.

The pursuer feels the change immediately. The cable stops “talking” in his hand.

He freezes, then gives a short testing tug.

You’re ready for that: you wedge the hook head under the ledge so it catches stone. The line locks. When he tugs again, it answers with a hard, dead resistance—like it’s snagged on masonry, not flesh.

“Damn it,” he whispers, annoyed more than alarmed. He shifts his stance at the edge, preparing to haul it free.

That’s your window.

You ease yourself over the drop. Your boots hit the lower floor with a slick *thup* you can’t fully hide, but the bend steals the sound. You take the hard left.

Ahead, Rusk is there in the dark, half-crouched, one hand pressed to the wall like he’s steadying himself. “Pipe’s live,” he breathes. “It— it moves.”

Behind you, the pursuer gives the hook a sharper yank. The wedged hook holds for half a second—then your wrap around the hook-blade slips a fraction on the wet wire. The line grinds, squeals faintly, and the hook head tears free of the stone with a harsh *scrape*.

“Hey!” the man snaps, now certain someone’s been on his gear. You hear him drop down after it—boots hitting the lower level—and the cable zips as he gathers it in.

Threat is immediate and closing: he’s over the drop and coming around the left bend with the hook retracted, moving fast and now hunting by certainty instead of guesswork. The older man remains back at the service slit you left behind, with whatever opening he’s made there.

### Turn 150 [PLAYER]

“Rusk—move. No talking.” I grab his sleeve and pull him forward, then as the pursuer rounds the bend I kick the loose pipe mount hard and shove the pipe outward into his path, using the rattle and swing to force him to flinch or stumble while we crawl fast into the dark.

*Agent reasoning: He’s close and confident now; I need a low-risk delay that uses the “live” loose pipe as a distraction/trip, then get distance without getting cornered. I’ll also keep Rusk moving and quiet.*

### Turn 151 [GAME]

“Rusk—move. No talking.”

You clamp his sleeve and haul. He goes with you—stumbling at first, then catching the rhythm on hands and knees, keeping his weight low. He doesn’t argue, just breathes through his nose like he’s trying not to cough.

The hook-man hits the corner hard. You hear his boot scrape the wall and the cable hiss as he pulls it close, ready to strike blind.

You kick the loose pipe mount.

The corroded bracket gives with a sharp *ping* and the whole pipe lurches outward on its remaining clamp, swinging into the bend like a drunken arm. It doesn’t explode or spray—no steam—just a sudden, heavy swing and a nasty metallic rattle that fills the turn.

The pursuer flinches exactly like you want—throws a forearm up and checks his step. The pipe clips his shoulder and knocks him sideways into the wall. His hook scrapes sparks off stone as he catches himself.

“Son of a—!” he snarls, more furious now than cautious.

But the pipe keeps moving. The half-free mount drags and the pipe drops lower, scraping the floor. It doesn’t block the passage completely, but it turns the corner into a snagging hazard: he has to step over it and duck the swing, and his cable wants to catch on it.

You and Rusk use the moment. You drag him past the bend and into deeper dark, the floor narrowing and pitching slightly downward. Your palms hit slime; your knees find broken grit. Rusk’s breathing turns ragged—he’s hurt or winded—but he keeps moving.

Behind you, the hook-man recovers fast. You hear him shove the pipe aside with his boot, then a quick *clank* as his cable catches and he yanks it free. He’s delayed, not stopped—maybe a few seconds.

Then a new sound threads in from farther ahead: a low, steady hum, like machinery or current running through old conduit. And with it, a faint chemical bite in the air—sharp, clean, wrong for damp stone.

Rusk whispers despite you: “That’s— that’s the junction. Don’t touch—”

The threat now is twofold and immediate:
- **Behind:** the hook-man is coming around the bend again, closing.
- **Ahead:** you’re crawling toward an active utility junction or machinery space in the dark—something humming, likely electrified, and the floor is getting wetter.

### Turn 152 [PLAYER]

I hiss, “Rusk—eyes up. Dry path. Where’s the safest edge—left wall or right?” and I shove him slightly ahead to lead. Without stopping, I scrape my hook-blade along the wall to feel for metal conduit and keep my hands off anything slick-looking, then I fling another stone behind us into the wet to draw the hook-man into the noisiest, slickest line while we hug the driest side.

*Agent reasoning: The hum and chemical bite suggest electrified equipment and possibly chlorine/ammonia—touching anything could kill us, but we can use the junction as a deterrent if we can identify a safe path. I need Rusk to guide us while I slow the pursuer without committing to a lethal gamble.*

### Turn 153 [GAME]

Rusk swallows a breath and forces his eyes open wider, scanning by feel and the faintest sheen.

“Right,” he rasps. “Right wall—stone. Left’s got—metal run.”

You shove him a half-body length ahead. He crawls like a man afraid to touch anything, keeping his shoulder almost brushing the right wall. You follow tight behind, hook-blade scraping along the right-hand masonry in short, controlled strokes.

The scrape tells you what your eyes can’t: rough brick and mortar at first—then, a few feet on, the blade kisses something smooth and cold protruding from the wall: a thin metal strap or conduit clip. You lift the blade off it immediately and shift your line even closer to the stone, palms careful, fingers spread to avoid anything wet.

The floor changes texture under your knees—wetter, with a slick film that pulls at fabric. The hum ahead grows louder and steadier, and the air sharpens with that clean chemical bite.

You snatch a loose stone and throw it back into the darkness behind you.

It skitters, then hits a pooled section with a loud *slap* and a long, ugly *sssskkk* as it slides. A half-second later, another *slap*—it’s bounced into a second puddle closer to the bend.

The hook-man reacts to the sound exactly as intended: you hear him surge forward. His boot lands in the wet with an unmistakable skid and a hard scrape against stone. He catches himself with a curse—“Shit!”—and his hook head clacks once as it taps the floor.

But he doesn’t go down. He slows, adjusts, and starts coming again—more careful now, dragging the hook low like a feeler.

Rusk keeps you on the drier right edge, but the “dry” is relative: the right wall is crumbling and narrow here, and the wet film is creeping across it in streaks. Ahead, the passage opens into a junction space: you can make out a squat boxy silhouette on the left wall (likely an old service cabinet) and a darker trench-like channel cut into the floor where water is flowing.

Threats are now clear and close:
- **Behind:** the pursuer is still advancing, slowed by the slick but adapting; you can hear his careful steps and the hook probing.
- **Ahead/left:** the metal run and service cabinet area are likely energized; the wet channel on the floor is actively moving water, widening the hazard zone as you approach the junction.

### Turn 154 [PLAYER]

I press my mouth close to Rusk’s ear. “Point out the trench edge—how wide, and is there a dry lip on the right we can shimmy past without stepping in?”

I grab another small stone and toss it toward the left cabinet/metal run (not into the water), listening for a telltale crackle or pop, then keep us hugging the right wall while I plant my hook-blade point into the crumbly mortar to steady our balance and prepare to shove Rusk past the junction fast.

*Agent reasoning: The junction sounds electrified and the floor is getting wetter, so rushing risks getting shocked. We need a safe path across/around the trench and a way to slow the hook-man without touching live metal—ideally by forcing him into the water/metal side while we take the right wall.*

### Turn 155 [GAME]

Rusk leans his head back just enough to listen, eyes fixed on the floor ahead like he’s reading a map only he can see.

“Trench,” he whispers. “Two feet across. Runs left-to-right—then turns and follows the left wall. Right side’s got a lip—six inches, maybe. Not dry. Just… less wet.”

You take another stone and flick it toward the left wall, aiming for the cabinet silhouette and the metal run above it.

The stone hits metal with a hollow *tunk*—then a sharp, insect-fast *tick-tick-tick* like it’s skittering down a conduit strap. For a beat, nothing.

Then: a thin, angry *snap* and a brief blue-white spit of light from the cabinet seam—like a tongue of arc searching for ground. It’s small, but it’s real. The smell in the air changes immediately: hot dust and ozone laid over that chemical clean.

Rusk jerks his hand back from the floor as if he felt it through the stone. “It’s live,” he says, louder than he means to.

Behind you, the hook-man hears it too—the *snap* carries. His pace changes: the careful steps stop. You hear him shift, then come faster, like he’s decided the hazard is worth it if it corners you. The hook head clacks once, then scrapes along the floor, probing for the trench line.

You plant the hook-blade point into the right wall’s crumbly mortar. It bites shallow, flakes brick dust, but it gives you purchase—enough to keep your weight off the slickest patch as you angle Rusk toward the narrow right-hand lip.

The junction is now directly in front of you:
- **Left:** the cabinet is actively arcing intermittently; any contact with the metal run or cabinet could shock, especially with the wet film.
- **Center:** the trench carries moving water; stepping in it risks a slip and also risks bridging current if the cabinet spits again.
- **Right:** a narrow, uneven lip you can shimmy along, but it’s only a handspan wide and shedding grit under pressure.

The hook-man is close enough now that you can hear his breathing between his steps—maybe one bend away—closing while you’re committed to crossing the junction.

### Turn 156 [PLAYER]

“Rusk, belt—now. Loop it on my wrist.” I thread his belt/strap through my arm and tug it tight like a leash, then I plant the hook-blade into the right wall as a handhold and shove Rusk ahead onto the six-inch lip, keeping his shoulder pinned to stone.

As we start to shimmy, I hiss, “Do not touch left—don’t even look at it,” and kick a pebble toward the cabinet side again to keep that snapping arc and draw the hook-man into the wet center while we hug the right edge.

*Agent reasoning: The cabinet is live and the trench water could carry current; the safest route is the narrow right lip, but Rusk may slip. I need to get him across fast while buying seconds—without touching metal or splashing. I’ll use my hook-blade as an anchor and my belt/coat as a tether, and I’ll try to bait the pursuer into the hazard with noise on the left.*

### Turn 157 [GAME]

Rusk fumbles at his waist with numb fingers. You catch the belt/strap, thread it over your wrist, and cinch it down until it bites. It isn’t pretty, but it’s a tether.

You sink the hook-blade point into the right wall again. Mortar crumbles; the blade finds a harder seam and holds. With your other hand, you shove Rusk forward.

He gets one foot onto the six-inch lip, toes turned sideways, shoulder scraping stone. His heel skates once on slime—your tether goes taut—and you jerk him back into the wall before he can step into the trench. He winces but keeps moving, breath coming in short, panicked pulls.

“Don’t touch left,” you hiss.

Rusk doesn’t answer. He’s staring at the stone in front of his nose like it’s the only safe thing in the city.

You kick a pebble toward the cabinet side.

It taps metal—*tink*—and a heartbeat later the cabinet answers with a harsher, longer arc: *KRK-KRK*, a blue-clean spit that crawls along the seam and flashes against the wet air. The moving water in the trench ripples as if something just struck near it. The ozone stink thickens.

Behind you, the hook-man rounds the bend and sees the junction’s geometry: trench in the middle, live cabinet on the left, your two bodies pressed to the right lip. He doesn’t charge straight in. He stops just short of the trench and tests with the hook, lowering it toward the wet center like he’s measuring depth.

“Thought you could bottle-neck me?” he says, voice tight. Then he swings the hook head low and *drags* it across the slick toward the right—aiming for your tether and ankles rather than the cabinet.

The hook scrapes stone, sending a spray of dirty water. It catches the edge of the lip with a hard *clack* and jolts your planted hook-blade in the wall; your handhold shudders. Rusk yelps and flattens harder into the stone, trying not to lose his footing.

Immediate, concrete danger:
- The hook-man is now fishing along the right lip; one good snag will yank Rusk (or you) into the trench.
- Your hook-blade handhold is holding, but the wall is shedding grit; repeated impacts may rip it free.
- The cabinet is arcing longer now; any slip left into metal/water could turn lethal fast.

### Turn 158 [PLAYER]

I yank the belt hard to pull Rusk another half-step forward along the lip. “Keep sliding—don’t stop.”  
As the hook scrapes toward our feet again, I drop my weight and stab my hook-blade down onto the cable/hook head against the lip, trying to pin it to stone long enough to shove it back into the wet center and buy us a few seconds to clear the junction.

*Agent reasoning: The hook is targeting our ankles/tether; I need to stop its reach without stepping into the trench or near the live cabinet. Best is to pin or foul the hook line against the right wall, keep Rusk moving, and avoid a direct fight.*

### Turn 160 [PLAYER]

I yank the belt hard to drag Rusk a half-step farther along the lip. “Keep sliding—don’t stop.”  
When the hook scrapes in again, I drop my weight and drive my hook-blade down onto the hook head/cable against the lip, trying to pin it to the stone just long enough to shove it back into the wet center and buy us a few seconds to clear the junction.

*Agent reasoning: The hook’s fishing along the lip is the immediate threat—if it snags a leg or the tether, we’re in the trench and possibly into live current. I need to keep Rusk moving while I briefly immobilize the hook head and force it back into the wet center, then follow fast before my handhold or footing fails.*

### Turn 161 [GAME]

The belt goes taut as you yank. Rusk lurches a half-step forward on the lip—his shoe sole squeals on slime—but he stays upright. He keeps sliding, shoulders grinding the wall, eyes fixed ahead.

The hook comes in again, low and ugly. You drop your weight and drive the hook-blade down.

Steel meets steel with a jarring *clang* that vibrates up your arm. For a second you’ve got it: the hook head pinned against the lip, the cable trapped under your blade’s edge. The hook-man grunts, surprised, and the line goes tight in his hands.

You shove.

The hook head skitters off the lip and drops into the wet trench with a loud *splash*. That buys you exactly the moment you wanted—Rusk gets another step, and you start to follow.

Then the consequence hits: the hook-man doesn’t let go. He yanks the cable back hard.

The cable, now in the water, draws a bright blue-white *snap* from the cabinet side—like the current found a better path. The arc leaps across the damp air and kisses the cable; the trench water shivers and flashes for an instant. The smell of ozone spikes, sharp enough to sting your nose.

The hook-man jerks as if punched. His hands clamp and then fling wide; he staggers back, swearing—“Son of a—!”—and you hear the hook clatter as he loses control of the line for a beat.

But your own hook-blade takes the hit through contact: a violent buzz in the metal, not full electrocution, but enough to numb your fingers and make your grip stutter. The blade tip gouges the stone as you reflexively pull it up.

Rusk, ahead of you, flinches at the crack and almost looks left—then catches himself and presses his face into the wall again, breathing ragged.

Clear threats now:
- The hook-man is momentarily stunned and has lost clean control of the cable, but he’s not down; he’s already reaching to recover it.
- The cable is now a live hazard in the trench: if it’s still bridging water and cabinet-side metal, another arc could jump unpredictably.
- Your right hand is numb and shaky from the shock through the blade; your wall handhold is less reliable until feeling returns.

### Turn 162 [PLAYER]

“Move, Rusk—now, don’t stop.” I haul the belt to drag him another step or two past the worst of the junction, keeping us plastered to the right wall.

I tuck my numb hand against my coat to warm it and switch my hook-blade to my other hand, eyes on the trench and cable; if the hook-man reaches for it again, I kick grit/loose stones into the trench from the right lip to splash and distract without getting close to the cabinet.

*Agent reasoning: The cable in the trench is now a live hazard, and my hand is numb—fighting more is risky. Best move is to use the hook-man’s brief stun to clear the junction, keep Rusk moving, and avoid touching anything conductive.*

### Turn 163 [GAME]

You haul the belt again. Rusk stumbles forward—one step, then another—boots scraping that narrow lip. He doesn’t stop this time; he’s running on your pull and pure fear, shoulder and cheek glued to the right wall like it can hide him.

Your numb hand disappears into your coat. The sting fades to a deep ache, fingers clumsy but not dead. You swap the hook-blade to your other hand; the grip feels wrong for a heartbeat, then workable.

In the trench, the cable lies half-submerged, twitching in weak little pulls as the hook-man gathers himself. The live cabinet on the left ticks and spits intermittently, blue-clean flashes reflecting off the water like teeth.

The hook-man shakes out his hands, swearing under his breath. He doesn’t reach into the water bare-handed again. Instead, he crouches and uses the hook’s shaft like a rake, trying to snag the cable from a safer angle—keeping his body back from the cabinet side.

You kick loose grit and small stones off the right lip.

They patter into the trench—*tik-tik-tik*—and the water answers with quick splashes. It’s enough movement to make the cable bob and drift, and it forces the hook-man to pause, recalculating where to place his tool. One stone strikes the cable; a faint *snap* of blue light jumps and dies in the water. He flinches hard and jerks the hook back, eyes wide now, more cautious.

Rusk makes it past the worst of the junction—clear of the cabinet’s closest reach—and the lip widens by maybe an inch. Not much, but it’s the first mercy you’ve seen in this conduit.

The hook-man recovers fast. He steps sideways along his bank, staying out of the trench, and changes tactics: he raises the hook and swings it higher, aiming not for your feet but for the belt line between you and Rusk—trying to catch the tether and use it to yank *both* of you off balance.

Threat, immediate and specific: the next swing is coming at waist height; if it catches the belt, you could be jerked backward into the junction while Rusk is pulled off the lip.

### Turn 164 [PLAYER]

“Unbuckle—now!” I snap, yanking the belt free from my wrist and shoving it forward at Rusk’s hands as I flatten to the wall. I bring the hook-blade up crosswise to catch/deflect the incoming hook swing, then backstep along the widened lip to keep distance from the junction.

*Agent reasoning: If he catches the belt, we both go down. Best is to remove the target fast and keep Rusk moving, while using the hook-blade to intercept the swing without overcommitting near the live water/cabinet.*

### Turn 165 [GAME]

“Unbuckle—now!”

Rusk’s hands fumble at his waist like he’s working a lock in the dark. He gets the buckle tongue halfway out—then freezes as the hook-man’s shadow rises.

You yank the belt free from your wrist and thrust the slack toward Rusk. He grabs it with both hands, knuckles white, still trying to free himself from it at the same time.

The hook swings in at waist height, a wide, mean arc meant to catch leather and take you both.

You flatten to the right wall and bring the hook-blade up crosswise.

Metal slams metal—*CLANG*—and the impact drives your forearm into your ribs. You do deflect it, but not clean. The hook’s point skates down your blade and catches the belt instead of your hip.

Leather bites tight. The line goes taut.

The hook-man uses the catch immediately, planting his boots and hauling backward with his whole weight. The belt jerks like a live thing.

Rusk yelps and is yanked a half-step back toward the junction; his heel slips on the wet lip and he windmills, shoulder banging the wall. He doesn’t go in—but he’s teetering, one foot searching air over the trench.

You backstep along the widened lip like you planned, but the belt’s tension fights you; it drags at your centerline, trying to pull you back into the narrowest part. Your hook-blade is still engaged with the hook head, but the belt is now the leverage point, not the steel.

The hook-man snarls, close enough now you can hear his breath. “Got you.”

Immediate threat: if he gets one more hard pull, Rusk’s balance breaks and he drops into the trench near the live cable/cabinet side. You’re also at risk of being yanked backward into the junction, where footing narrows and the electrified water is closest.

### Turn 166 [PLAYER]

“Let it go, Rusk!” I snap, then saw the hook-blade down hard across the belt where it’s caught, trying to sever it in one or two strokes. As soon as it gives, I shove Rusk forward by the shoulder into the wider section and keep my body between him and the hook-man, blade up and ready to deflect the next swing.

*Agent reasoning: The belt is now a liability; if it stays hooked, one yank drops Rusk into the trench. Best is to remove the leverage point immediately—cut the belt—then use the moment to get Rusk stable and create distance.*

### Turn 167 [GAME]

“Let it go, Rusk!”

Rusk’s eyes flick to you—then to the trench—then he obeys. His fingers open and the belt whips tight in the hook-man’s pull, no longer anchored by Rusk’s grip.

You saw the hook-blade down across the leather where it’s cinched on the hook point. The first stroke bites but skids—wet leather, tensioned hard, fights you. The second stroke lands true. The belt parts with a sharp *snap* and both halves recoil: one end slaps the stone lip near your boots; the other end jerks back with the hook as the hook-man’s leverage suddenly vanishes.

The hook-man stumbles backward, arms flaring to catch his balance. His boots scrape on his bank; he doesn’t fall in, but he loses his stance and the hook dips low.

You take the opening and shove Rusk forward by the shoulder. He staggers into the wider section, catches himself against the wall, and keeps moving—breathing like he’s swallowing nails.

The hook-man recovers fast. He lifts the hook again, but his expression has changed—less confident, more careful. He doesn’t swing immediately. Instead, he jabs the hook tip toward your legs, testing your distance, trying to herd you back toward the junction without committing.

Behind him, the trench water still twitches around the cable. A faint blue flicker pops once—small, but close enough to remind you what a misstep costs.

Rusk, now a few paces ahead, calls back hoarsely without turning: “There’s— there’s a maintenance ladder—up ahead—”

Immediate threat: the hook-man is probing for a low catch on your ankle or coat hem; one successful snag could yank you off the lip into the trench, where the live cable and cabinet-side arcs are still intermittently flashing.

### Turn 168 [PLAYER]

“Rusk—get on that ladder and don’t look back.”

I keep my back to the right wall and shuffle-retreat toward the wider section, blade low to swat his hook aside if it comes in at my ankles; as I move, I angle my steps to kick the severed belt end off the lip into the trench so there’s less for him to snag or use.

*Agent reasoning: I can’t afford to get snagged, and trading blows on this lip is suicidal. I’ll keep my stance tight to the wall, use the blade to control his hook rather than attack, and retreat toward the ladder while buying Rusk time to climb.*

### Turn 169 [GAME]

“Rusk—get on that ladder and don’t look back.”

Rusk doesn’t argue. He lurches ahead, one hand skimming the wall for balance. In the wider section the conduit opens enough to see it: a rusted maintenance ladder bolted into the right wall, rungs slick with condensation. He grabs it and starts climbing, boots clanging softly—fast, ugly, determined.

You keep your back to the right wall and shuffle-retreat, blade low.

The hook-man takes the hint and goes for your feet. He snaps the hook in low, a quick ankle-height jab meant to catch and pull. You swat it aside with the hook-blade; steel bites steel with a grating *krrt* and the hook glances off toward the trench instead of into your shin.

As you move, you angle a step and kick the severed belt end off the lip.

It flips out into the trench and slaps the water.

For a half-second it just floats—then the cable under the surface twitches and the water answers with that too-clean blue flash. The belt end jerks like it’s alive and sinks, smoking faintly. The air sharpens with burnt leather and copper.

The hook-man recoils from the flash, but it also tells him something: the trench is “live” enough to punish anything that falls in. He stops trying to muscle you and shifts to forcing a mistake—short, impatient feints that try to make you step wide.

Above you, Rusk reaches the top of the ladder—or what passes for “top” here: a dark square cutout with a lip of corroded metal. He wedges a shoulder through and hisses down, breath ragged: “Hatch—stuck—”

Immediate, concrete danger: the hook-man is about to commit to a hard, two-handed yank aimed at your blade arm—trying to knock your guard wide so his next low sweep can take your footing. One stumble, and the electrified trench is directly under your left foot.

### Turn 170 [PLAYER]

“Brace your feet on the rung—kick the hatch lip, don’t pry with your fingers!”

I drop my center of gravity and step in close to jam his hook-shaft with my forearm and blade, then stomp at his forward boot/shin to spoil his two-handed yank; if it buys even a heartbeat, I back into the ladder’s base and angle my body to climb up after Rusk.

*Agent reasoning: I need to avoid getting yanked off balance near the live trench; buying a second for Rusk to force the hatch matters more than landing hits. I’ll keep distance, disrupt his grip, and get Rusk moving with clear instructions.*

### Turn 171 [GAME]

“Brace your feet on the rung—kick the hatch lip, don’t pry with your fingers!”

Rusk, above, grunts an acknowledgement and plants his boots on a rung hard enough to rattle the ladder. You hear the dull *thud-thud* of him kicking at the hatch lip overhead.

Down on the lip, you drop your weight and step in before the hook-man can get that two-handed yank. Close up, he smells like wet rope and cheap camphor. You drive your forearm into the hook’s shaft and pin it against your hook-blade, turning his leverage into a cramped wrestle.

He tries to wrench free anyway—shoulders bunching, elbows flaring—but your stomp lands on his forward shin/boot edge with a solid, ugly *crack*.

He barks out a sound that’s half pain, half fury, and his stance buckles. The hook dips; the point scrapes stone and sparks once as it kisses the wet lip.

You get your heartbeat of space.

You back into the base of the ladder, keeping the blade between you and him, and set your hand on the lowest rung to start up.

He recovers faster than you’d like. Limping, he changes tactics: instead of pulling, he swings the hook head sideways at knee height, aiming to catch the ladder upright itself—either to yank you off as you climb or to rattle Rusk above.

The hook catches the ladder’s side rail with a metallic *CLONK* and he hauls.

The whole ladder shudders. Your grip slips a fraction on the wet rung, and above you Rusk curses as his boots skid on the rung he’s braced on. The hatch lip overhead gives a little—metal squealing—then stops, still mostly jammed.

Immediate threat: if the hook-man gets a second solid pull on the ladder rail, it’ll wrench you off-balance at the base and could peel Rusk off his rung above; either of you could fall—into each other or off the lip toward the live trench.

### Turn 172 [PLAYER]

I hook my boot around the ladder’s lowest rung and lean my weight into it to steady the rail, then slash down at the hook where it’s biting the ladder—aiming to shear his leverage or force him to let go. “Rusk—again, hard! If it moves, drop through!”

*Agent reasoning: If he keeps yanking the ladder, both of us risk falling into the live trench. I need to stop the pull fast without overcommitting—disable his grip/anchor point and create space for Rusk to finish the hatch, then climb.*

### Turn 173 [GAME]

You hook your boot around the lowest rung and lean in, turning your leg into a brace. The ladder stops skating sideways—still vibrating, but it holds.

You chop down at the hook where it’s biting the rail.

Steel meets steel at an ugly angle. Your blade doesn’t shear the hook—too thick, too well-forged—but it *does* bite the wooden wedge lashed just behind the hook head (a spacer he’s using to keep purchase on slick metal). The wedge splits. The hook shifts, loses its “tooth,” and scrapes down the rail in a shower of tiny sparks.

The hook-man has to let go for a half-second to keep from losing the tool entirely. He snatches it back with a hiss, shaking his stung hands, limping worse now.

“Rusk—again, hard! If it moves, drop through!”

Above, Rusk answers with a strangled “Got it!” and drives both boots into the hatch lip. The metal finally gives with a tearing squeal. A rectangle of darker air opens overhead—and with it, a gust that smells like tar paper and rain instead of copper.

Rusk doesn’t bother being graceful. He drops through the opening onto whatever’s above with a heavy *thump* and a yelp, then immediately scrambles away from the hole. His voice comes down tight: “I’m up—Lena, NOW—”

The hook-man, seeing his window closing, lunges—not at you, but at the ladder itself, shoving his shoulder into the rail to rattle it and buy one last chance to pull you off the base.

The ladder bucks under your braced boot. Your knee twinges hard from the torque, but it doesn’t slip.

Immediate threat: he’s about to switch from the ladder to *you*—a straight thrust with the hook point aimed at your thigh/hip while you’re half-turned to climb. If it lands, you’ll be pinned against the rungs with the trench at your left.

### Turn 174 [PLAYER]

I twist off the ladder and slam my forearm and shoulder into his hook-arm to jam the thrust wide, then kick his bad shin again to make him fold. If he staggers, I pivot back, grab the rungs, and climb hard—shouting up, “Rusk, hand down—now!”

*Agent reasoning: I can’t risk getting pinned mid-climb; I need to spoil his line of thrust and create just enough space to ascend fast. A quick shove/deflection into the trench side is safer than trading blows.*

### Turn 175 [GAME]

You twist off the ladder just as the hook point comes in.

Your shoulder and forearm smash into his hook-arm. The thrust gets knocked wide—close enough you feel the hook’s cold draft past your coat—but it doesn’t bite you. The hook tip skitters along the ladder rail instead, screeching metal.

He tries to re-aim with brute strength.

You kick his bad shin again.

This time he folds at the knee with a sharp, involuntary drop of weight. His free hand slaps the wall to keep him from going down into the trench side. The hook clatters, and for a breath he’s off-balance, face tight and wet with rain-sweat.

You pivot back to the ladder, grab the rungs, and climb hard.

“Rusk, hand down—now!”

Above, Rusk’s arm snakes down through the hatch—fingers splayed, searching blind. You get two rungs up and catch his wrist. His grip locks like a vise and he hauls while you climb, turning your scramble into a jagged, fast ascent.

Below, the hook-man recovers enough to lash out at your ankle. The hook catches your heel for a split-second—more snag than stab—yanking your boot down and wrenching your knee. Your foot slips off the rung and swings out over the live trench.

Rusk yanks *up* hard, and the hook tears free with a ripping scrape off your boot leather instead of dragging you down. Your shin smacks the ladder rail; pain blooms hot, but you’re still climbing.

You get your torso to the hatch lip. Rusk grabs your collar and shoulder and drags you through onto a cramped service space above—tarred boards, low beams, and rain pattering on something like roof sheeting.

Immediate threat: the hook-man is already climbing after you, fast despite the limp. His hook scrapes on the rungs below, and the ladder is still shuddering—if he reaches the hatch, he’ll have the high ground denied but the choke point controlled.

### Turn 176 [PLAYER]

I slam the hatch cover back down as far as it’ll go and jam my hook-blade through any gap/hasp to bar it. “Rusk—help me wedge it, then we move; no hero stuff.”

*Agent reasoning: He’s coming up the same ladder; a choke point favors whoever controls the hatch. I’m hurt, so I should avoid a prolonged fight and instead block or collapse his access while we can.*

### Turn 177 [GAME]

You drop to a knee and shove the hatch cover down. It isn’t a hinged “door” so much as a heavy, warped metal plate that rides in a crude frame—meant to slide and seat. It slams partway, then stops with a teeth-rattling *clang* against the same bend that jammed it earlier. There’s still a hand-wide gap on one side.

You jam your hook-blade through the gap, catching it under a corroded crossbar/hasp nub on the frame. Metal squeals as you lever the blade sideways to bite. It holds—barely—your grip vibrating with each tremor from below.

“Rusk—help me wedge it, then we move; no hero stuff.”

Rusk is already there, breathing hard, face pale in the dim. He nods once and snatches a loose chunk of tarred board from the floor. “Yeah. Yeah—no hero.” He slams the board edge-first into the gap above your blade, hammering it with the heel of his hand until it wedges tight.

From below: the hook-man hits the ladder rungs hard—fast climbing. The hatch rattles as he reaches up and shoves. Your blade flexes in the gap; the board creaks.

Then the hook tip punches up through the remaining space, stabbing blind for anything soft. It scrapes your sleeve, missing skin by an inch, and catches the wedged board instead. He yanks. The board shifts a finger-width.

Rusk grabs the board with both hands and shoves it back in, snarling, “Stay DOWN there!”

The hook-man answers with a wet laugh that turns into a cough. You hear him reposition—hook scraping the frame, searching for a better bite. If he finds purchase on your hook-blade or the crossbar nub, he can pry the whole jam loose.

As you hold the blade steady, you notice something else: the tarred boards you’re kneeling on aren’t solid decking. One section near the hatch has been cut and re-laid—fresh nails, different tar. A maintenance access, disguised.

Immediate threat is twofold: the hatch jam is holding but degrading under prying, and there may be a second way up into this space the hook-man already knows—through that patched section.

### Turn 178 [PLAYER]

“Rusk—keep pressure on that wedge. Don’t grab the hook if it comes through.”

I ease my hook-blade out a hair to avoid it being used as leverage, then shove a loose board and any scrap I can reach into the gap to thicken the jam. While Rusk holds, I crawl to the patched section, press my ear to it, and test the nails with my blade tip—quietly—listening for movement underneath.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch jam won’t hold long, and that patched floor could be a second entry point or escape route. I need to keep the hook-man from prying my blade loose while we relocate fast, ideally blocking both access points or buying seconds to flee.*

### Turn 179 [GAME]

“Rusk—keep pressure on that wedge. Don’t grab the hook if it comes through.”

Rusk plants his shoulder over the hatch seam and leans his weight into the board, palms white-knuckled. “I’m on it—just—move.”

You ease your hook-blade back a fraction. The moment the steel stops acting like a pin, the hatch plate shivers—like it wants to spring. A hook tip snaps up through the gap, probing for your blade. It finds only air and scrapes the frame, annoyed.

You feed in whatever you can reach: a loose slat, then a splintered strip of tarred lath. You shove them into the seam above the main wedge until the gap looks packed, not just blocked. The hook stabs again and catches wood instead of purchase. You hear a frustrated grunt below and the wet rasp of him dragging the hook away to try a different angle.

Rusk hisses through his teeth as the pressure changes. “He’s prying—slow, but—”

You crawl off, low, to the patched section. Up close it’s obvious: newer nails, set too straight, heads still sharp-edged. Not old work. Done fast.

You press your ear to it.

At first, only rain on sheeting and Rusk’s breath. Then: a faint *tap…tap…tap* from beneath, not random settling—deliberate, spaced. Metal on wood, like someone feeling for the edge of the patch with a tool.

You test a nail head with the tip of your blade, gently rocking it.

It doesn’t squeal. It *shifts*—a hair—like the nail isn’t fully set into real joist, more into a thin backing strip. This patch isn’t meant to hold weight; it’s meant to look intact.

Under your ear, the tapping stops.

A second later, the wood under your cheek gives the smallest upward flex—someone below has put pressure on it, finding the weak spot. Dust sifts through a seam line you hadn’t noticed until it moved.

Threat, clear: there’s at least one person directly under the patched boards, preparing to push up into this space while the hook-man keeps you busy at the hatch.

### Turn 180 [PLAYER]

I hiss, “Rusk—second entry, patched floor, right here. Don’t leave the hatch.”

I roll off the patch and plant my weight beside it, not on it, then drive my blade tip into the seam and pry up just enough to see or catch fingers—ready to stomp the panel back down if it lifts. “Whoever’s under there—don’t. I’ll pin you to the joists.”

*Agent reasoning: There’s a second attacker about to come up through the patched boards; I need to warn Rusk without pulling him off the hatch, and I should deny the entry point while keeping myself out of a sudden grab.*

### Turn 181 [GAME]

“Second entry,” you hiss. “Patched floor, right here. Don’t leave the hatch.”

Rusk doesn’t look over. He just shifts his stance to keep his shoulder jammed into the wedge, voice strained. “Got it. I’m not moving.”

You roll off the patch and plant your weight on the solid boards beside it. The patched section flexes again—someone below testing it. You drive your hook-blade tip into the seam and lever up a bare inch.

A sliver of darkness opens—and a human eye appears in it, wide and bloodshot, staring up at steel.

You catch a flash of a face: young, maybe late teens, skin slick with sweat, a bruise-purple crescent on the neck like a thumbprint. Salt grit clings to their hairline. Their hand comes up fast, fingers splayed, not to grab you—more like to shield their face from the blade.

“Don’t,” you warn. “I’ll pin you to the joists.”

The kid freezes, breath fluttering. “Please—don’t—” Their voice is hoarse, drug-thick. “They’re behind me.”

Behind them: a second sound, closer and heavier than the tapping—a controlled scrape of boots on a rung or narrow ladder under the patch. Someone else is coming up the same access, using the kid as the first body through.

At the hatch, the hook-man changes tactics. There’s a hard *clank* as he hooks something solid—your packed seam shifts, not much, but enough that the hatch plate bumps upward a fraction. Rusk grunts as the pressure tries to peel him off it. “He’s got purchase—Lena—!”

Under your blade, the kid’s eye darts sideways in panic as a shadow crowds them from below. A hand—larger, rougher—slides into the gap from under the patch, groping for the lifted edge to rip it up.

You now have two immediate threats:
1) the hatch jam is starting to give under prying force; if it pops, the hook-man is coming through fast.
2) someone stronger than the kid is about to force the patched panel open from below, right in front of you.

### Turn 182 [PLAYER]

I snap my blade down flat on the larger hand—using the spine to smash knuckles, not cut—then shove the kid’s shoulder back through the gap. “Crawl away from the opening, now—quiet.”

I drop my weight onto the patch edge and stomp it down, then drag a heavy board across it like a bar. Over my shoulder I bark, “Rusk—if that hatch jumps, let it go and fall back toward me. We don’t get pinched in two places.”

*Agent reasoning: Two breaches at once is how you die. The kid is a shield and a source of info; I can use them to jam the patch while buying Rusk seconds at the hatch. I’ll disable the reaching hand without committing to a full fight, then force the panel shut and add weight/obstacles.*

### Turn 183 [GAME]

You bring the spine of the hook-blade down like a hammer.

It lands on knuckles with a dull *thunk*—bone on steel—with a sharp, involuntary yelp from below. The bigger hand spasms and withdraws so fast it scrapes skin on the seam. Something metal clatters down there—tool dropped, or the hook scraping a rung.

You shove the kid’s shoulder with your free hand, not gently. They flinch, then scramble backward out of the slit, elbows and knees scraping wood. “Okay—okay—” they whisper, already trying to make themselves small in the dark.

The patch edge lifts a fraction again as weight shifts below—then you drop yours onto it and stomp. The boards settle with a flat, ugly *whump* that knocks dust out of the seams. You drag a heavier plank across the patch like a bar and pin it under your knee.

It holds—for now—but you feel it: the patch isn’t framed like real flooring. It’s a lid. With leverage and time, they can push it.

Over your shoulder: “Rusk—if that hatch jumps, let it go and fall back toward me.”

Rusk answers through clenched teeth, “Gladly.”

Right on cue, the hatch gives a violent shudder. The packed scraps you jammed into the seam spit splinters. The plate lifts a hand’s breadth—enough for a hook tip to stab up and snag the edge of the wedge board. Rusk lets go instead of wrestling it. He stumbles backward toward you, catching himself on a roof beam.

The hatch doesn’t fully open—your extra stuffing slowed it—but it’s no longer “jammed.” It’s *contested*: the hook-man below can work it wider with a few more good pries.

From under the patch, the larger voice—low, controlled—hisses at the kid: “Move. Get out of the way.” Then, louder for you: “Easy, Marrow. You don’t want to crush a runaway under church boards, do you?”

The threat is immediate and concrete:
- The hook-man is one or two pries away from forcing the hatch enough to climb through.
- Under the patch, the stronger climber is repositioning for a harder shove—likely using a tool again—while the kid retreats, meaning the next push won’t be buffered by a body.

### Turn 184 [PLAYER]

I keep my knee on the bar-board and slide another plank crosswise over the patch, hunting for something to wedge it under—beam, nailhead, anything—then I call down, “You know my name, so you know I don’t bluff. Tell me who you are, and send the kid back—hands empty.”

Without taking my eyes off the patch seam, I tell Rusk, low and sharp, “Get to the far corner and find anything we can jam in that hatch track—pipe, spike, whatever. Don’t go near the opening.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re about to get hit from two angles; I need to buy time and force a single chokepoint. I’ll try to trap the patch shut, then relocate to a position where we can watch both openings and get information from the voice that knows my name.*

### Turn 185 [GAME]

You keep your knee planted on the first plank and slide a second board crosswise over the patch, feeling for purchase. The boards up here are tar-sticky; the plank drags with a gritty squeal. You find a protruding nailhead and a low joist edge—enough to cant the cross-plank so it “hooks” under the lip of the joist if the patch tries to rise.

Below, something bumps the underside—testing. The patch twitches but doesn’t lift. Your makeshift bar holds for the moment.

You call down. “You know my name, so you know I don’t bluff. Tell me who you are, and send the kid back—hands empty.”

Silence for two beats. Then the larger voice answers, calm but with pain clipped into it. “Name doesn’t matter. I’m the one keeping this from turning into a body count.”

The kid’s whisper floats up from the dark, closer now, like they’ve been pushed forward anyway. “I— I don’t have anything—”

A hand appears in the seam again—smaller this time. Two empty fingers, shaking, slide up as proof. The kid isn’t climbing through; they’re being used as a shield, again—held just under the opening where you can’t see what’s behind them.

At the hatch, metal scrapes. The hook-man below has switched to steady work: pry, reset, pry. The hatch edge rises another fraction, and you hear the wedge board Rusk had braced with give a sharp *crack*—not broken through, but split.

You tell Rusk, low: “Far corner. Find anything we can jam in that hatch track—pipe, spike—whatever. Don’t go near the opening.”

Rusk moves fast, keeping low. He crab-walks away from the hatch toward the far corner of the upper service space, hands sweeping through debris. “Got—something—” He grabs a length of rusted conduit strap and a broken bolt the size of a thumb, then a short iron rod half-buried under tar paper.

As he turns back, the hatch below bumps up again. The hook tip stabs through and catches air—then clinks against the hatch frame like it’s measuring the gap. One more good pry and a shoulder can fit.

Under your knee, pressure builds: the larger climber below shifts position for a coordinated heave. You feel it through the boards—weight settling, then bracing—like someone planting feet on a rung and putting both hands to the underside.

Threats, immediate:
- Hatch: now open roughly a handspan and widening with each pry; entry is imminent.
- Patch: a full-force shove is coming; if it breaks your bar’s purchase, the panel will pop and someone will surge up under you.

### Turn 186 [PLAYER]

“Kid—back. Now. Crawl away from the opening and keep your hands where I can’t mistake them.”

I grind my knee harder into the bar-board and angle my hook-blade into the seam as a wedge, ready to stab down if a hand comes up again. “Body-count guy—talk fast. Who’s downstairs with the hook, and why are you using a drugged kid as a shield?”

Without looking away, I snap to Rusk, “Slide that iron rod into the hatch track from the SAFE side—use the strap as a pusher. If it pops, we retreat together to this corner and I’ll cover the hatch while you keep that patch pinned with me.”

*Agent reasoning: Two breaches are about to happen; we can’t hold both by force. Best is to buy seconds with a deterrent, force the kid out of the line of fire, and hard-jam one entry (hatch) with the iron rod while I keep the patch pinned. I’ll also try to extract info from the “body count” guy and set terms.*

### Turn 187 [GAME]

“Kid—back. Now.”

The small fingers vanish from the seam. You hear frantic scraping below—knees on wood, a muffled sob swallowed hard. The kid retreats far enough that their breath isn’t right under the crack anymore.

You grind your knee down until the plank bites into your leg, then set the hook-blade’s belly into the seam like a cold chisel. The panel shudders once under a probing push; your wedge steals the lift.

“Body-count guy—talk fast. Who’s downstairs with the hook, and why are you using a drugged kid as a shield?”

A wet exhale from below—pain and annoyance. “Because the kid’s already marked. Same as you.” A pause, then, sharper: “The one at the hatch isn’t mine. Guild safety—oilskins, hook tool. He’s here to ‘inspect’ and he doesn’t care who he steps on.”

That answers one thing and makes another worse: there are at least two groups converging in the same crawlspace, and neither wants witnesses.

At the hatch, the prying becomes a rhythm—*pry… reset… pry*—and the gap widens to two hands. You can hear the hook-man’s breath now, close and steady.

Rusk moves to the “safe” side like you ordered—keeping his body away from the opening. He uses the conduit strap like a long spoon, nudging the short iron rod toward the hatch track from the corner angle. It’s awkward; he can’t reach straight on without exposing himself.

The rod scrapes, catches, then slides into something metal-on-metal with a harsh *clang*. For a second the hatch stops rising—jammed against the rod.

Then the hook below snags the rod. The metal shrieks as it’s pulled, twisting in the track. Rusk braces and shoves back with the strap, but the leverage is against him; the rod starts to inch toward the opening.

Under your knee, the bigger climber below commits to the heave. The patch bows—your cross-plank bites under the joist lip, holds, and the whole assembly groans like it might tear free. Your blade-wedge vibrates in the seam from the pressure.

New, immediate threats:
- Hatch: the hook-man is now actively trying to yank the rod out; if he gets it free, he’s coming through fast.
- Patch: one more full-body shove risks ripping your bar’s “hook” off the joist; if it slips, the panel will pop up under you.

### Turn 188 [PLAYER]

“Rusk—let it go. Drop back here, now. If he yanks it free, I don’t want your hands anywhere near that hatch.”

I crab backward a half step, keeping my knee and the cross-plank pinned, then hook my blade through the hatch gap from a distance and yank the loosened wedge-board and splintered scrap into the opening like a snag—aiming to foul the frame and make the first climb-through slow and bloody. “Oilskins—come up and you’re losing fingers.”

Without lifting my weight off the patch, I stab the blade tip down through the seam just enough to bite wood, not flesh—right where the larger climber’s hands would need to go. “Down there—stop pushing. Next time it’s your knuckles again. Tell your ‘Guild safety’ friend to back off or you both get trapped under here.”

*Agent reasoning: Two breaches at once will get us killed. The hatch is moments from opening, so I’ll force a retreat route and buy time by making the hatch opening painful to enter. I’ll also try to stop the patch push by threatening the climber with a direct injury if he continues, while keeping Rusk out of reach.*

### Turn 189 [GAME]

“Rusk—let it go. Drop back here, now.”

Rusk doesn’t argue. He releases pressure on the conduit strap and scrambles back to your corner, palms up and empty as he comes. The iron rod immediately shrieks as it’s yanked the last inch—then vanishes downward with a clatter that echoes through the hatch shaft.

You crab back a half-step—just enough to get reach—keeping your knee welded to the bar-board and the cross-plank still hooked under the joist lip. The patch stays down, but it bows under you like a drumhead.

You hook your blade through the hatch gap and snag the loosened wedge-board and splintered scraps, dragging them into the opening. Wood jams into the frame crooked. The hatch lip catches; the gap becomes a jagged mouth full of teeth.

From below comes an immediate, furious hiss and a sharp *crack*—a knuckle or tool striking the jam. Then a wet grunt. Something drips up onto the underside edge and spatters back down: not much, but enough to mean you got what you wanted—slow and painful.

“Oilskins—come up and you’re losing fingers.”

A voice answers right under the hatch now, close enough you can hear the smile in it. “That’s the idea, Marrow. Makes the report cleaner.”

You stab the blade tip down through the patch seam—not deep, just enough to bite wood where hands would need to find purchase. The larger climber below stops pushing mid-heave. The pressure under your knee eases a fraction.

“Down there—stop pushing. Next time it’s your knuckles again. Tell your ‘Guild safety’ friend to back off or you both get trapped under here.”

The larger voice, tight: “You think I can *tell* him anything? He’s not here for me.”

A new sound cuts through the crawlspace: a thin, reedy whistle—once, then twice—answered faintly from farther down the conduit. Not your whistle. A signal.

The hook-man at the hatch changes tactics. Instead of forcing up into the jam, he starts working laterally—hook scraping along the hatch edge like he’s trying to peel your snag out from the side. The hatch flexes with each pull.

Then: boots on metal rungs below—another set, heavier, coming up fast. Someone else is climbing toward the hatch, and they’re not stopping to be careful.

Concrete threats now:
- Hatch: your snag is holding, but it’s being actively peeled; a second climber is arriving to add force. If it gives, entry will be sudden and violent.
- Patch: the larger climber has paused, but he’s still under you; if the hatch opens and fighting starts, he may shove again to use the chaos.

### Turn 190 [PLAYER]

I lean in just enough to speak down the seam. “Louder. Who are you, and what do you want from me—right now—before the oilskins come through?”

To Rusk, I whisper, “Back wall—find me something that burns. Lamp oil, rag, anything. If they breach, we blind the hatch and run.”

I keep my knee pinned, then jam the hook-blade deeper into the hatch gap to catch the hook tool if it slides in—trying to lock metal-on-metal and hold the jam a few seconds longer. “Next hand up loses it.”

*Agent reasoning: Two attackers are about to breach the hatch; holding both openings is unsustainable. I need to slow the hatch further, keep Rusk safe, and extract information from the larger climber while I still have leverage over the patch.*

### Turn 192 [PLAYER]

I keep my knee and the cross-plank pinned and listen hard at both seams. “Talk—who are you, and how many are coming up that hatch?”

Without looking back, I hiss to Rusk, “Find us an exit or something to jam that hatch—then anything that burns. Quiet.”

*Agent reasoning: We lost the last exchange’s outcome—need to re-establish immediate threats and positions before making a risky move. I’ll confirm what I can see/hear, keep pressure on the patch, and get Rusk searching for an exit/cover while I question the climber.*

### Turn 193 [GAME]

You keep your weight planted. The cross-plank creaks once, then settles—still hooked, still holding. You press your ear close enough to the patch seam to catch breath and grit moving in the dark.

Below the patch, the larger climber answers through his teeth, louder this time so the hatch can hear too. “Name’s Ed. I want you not dead, because you’re the only one in this crawl who can make noise that sticks.”

At the hatch, the hook tool scrapes again—metal on wood—testing for your blade. You hear a second man arrive on the rungs: boots hit the last rung with a dull clang, then he crowds the first.

Ed continues, fast: “Two at the hatch. Hook-man and a heavier one. There’s at least one more behind them—heard the ladder sing twice before they got here.”

The hook-man speaks up from directly under the jam, voice calm and official. “Harbor Authority Safety. Midnight inspection. You’re impeding a lawful access point.”

Then the heavier one—breathing hard—doesn’t bother with words. He rams his shoulder up into the hatch frame. The jammed scraps jump; your snag holds, but the whole hatch lip flexes and sheds splinters. Your hook-blade in the gap catches something—metal-on-metal for a heartbeat—then slides off with a sharp *skitter* as the hook tool jerks away. You’ve bought seconds, not safety.

Rusk moves when you hiss. He keeps low, feeling along the tarred boards and studs in the upper service space, hands patting for seams and fasteners. He finds a narrow maintenance crawl to your right—too tight for a quick scramble, but it’s there—and a rusted ring-bolt set into a beam.

He whispers back, barely audible: “Crawl run—right side. Tight. Ring-bolt here—could lash something. No fuel. Smells like tar and dust only.”

Below, Ed shifts—careful now, less pressure on the patch. “If they breach, they’ll come for you first. They’ve got your name.”

At the hatch, the heavier man rams again—harder. The jam audibly fractures. One more solid hit and the opening will clear enough for fingers.

**Immediate threat:** two Guild “safety” men are forcing the hatch; the jam is cracking and will likely fail within moments. Ed is pinned below the patch and could shove at any time if panic or opportunity hits.

### Turn 194 [PLAYER]

I hiss to Rusk, “Ring-bolt—now. Lash the hatch lid to it if you can. Anything—strap, belt, your damn shirt. Then get into that right-side crawl and don’t stop.”

Down the seam I snap, “Ed—get the kid away from the opening and keep your hands off the patch. If you shove again, I’ll pin you there and let ‘Safety’ have you first.”

I shove my hook-blade into the hatch gap and twist it hard to catch on the frame as the next shoulder-ram comes, trying to turn the breach into a slow, screaming pry instead of a pop—then I start sliding backward toward the right-side crawl, keeping my weight on the patch until the last second.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is about to give, so I need distance and a choke point. The tight crawl run is our best escape; I’ll buy seconds by lashing the hatch and threatening injury, while trying to get Ed to stop pushing and the kid clear. I don’t trust Ed, but any distraction helps.*

Down the seam: “Ed—get the kid away from the hatch. No more shoving; you push again and I leave you for ‘Safety’.”

I jam my hook-blade into the hatch gap and twist to turn the next ram into a grinding pry, then slide backward toward the right-side crawl, keeping my knee and weight on the patch until the last possible moment before I slip into the tight passage.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is about to pop and fighting at the opening is a losing bet; my best chance is to buy seconds with a lash/jam, keep the kid out of the line, and retreat into the tight right-side crawl where fewer attackers can follow at once.*

### Turn 198 [PLAYER]

I hiss to Rusk, “Ring-bolt—lash the hatch to it. Strap, belt, shirt—anything. Then get in that right-side crawl and keep moving.”

Down the seam: “Ed—get the kid away from the hatch. No more shoving; you push again and I leave you for ‘Safety’.”

I jam my hook-blade into the hatch gap and twist, trying to make the next shoulder-ram a grinding pry instead of a clean pop, then I slide backward toward the right-side crawl, keeping my knee and weight on the patch until the last second before I slip into the tight passage.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is about to blow; buying seconds matters more than fighting. Securing the hatch to the ring-bolt could force them to waste time, and the tight right-side crawl is our best exit. I need Ed to stop shoving so I’m not dumped into the opening mid-move.*

### Turn 199 [GAME]

Rusk doesn’t argue. He’s already got your belt in his hands—yanks it free from your waist with a hard, practiced pull that nearly takes you off your knee. He threads it through the rusted ring-bolt, then under the hatch’s inner bracing where he can reach, cinching it tight with a grunt. The leather bites; the buckle clicks; the hatch lid jerks downward an inch as the strap takes tension.

“Move,” he breathes, and snakes into the right-side crawl on his elbows, boots scraping tar as he goes.

You drive the hook-blade into the gap and twist.

The next shoulder-ram comes like a battering wave. Wood shrieks. Your hook-blade catches the lip and turns the impact into a long, grinding pry—exactly what you wanted—except the sound is worse: a sustained, tearing scream of wood and metal that broadcasts your position.

Below, the hook-man curses, close and sharp. “They’ve got a brace in it—cut it. CUT IT.”

Something thin and metallic bites up into the gap from below—his hook tool, now used like a saw against the strap. You feel the vibration through the hatch frame. The belt holds for a moment, then the leather starts to fuzz and give.

Ed hears your warning. His voice drops, and there’s a quick shuffle below as he drags someone back from the opening. A smaller set of feet scuffs away; a stifled whimper gets swallowed. “Kid’s back,” Ed says. “I’m not touching it.”

You keep your knee planted on the patch until the last possible second, then slide off and into the right-side crawl. It’s tight—shoulders scraping, cheek against gritty brick. Behind you, the patch immediately rises a fraction with the relief of your weight, but it doesn’t blow; Ed keeps still.

Then the belt gives with a wet snap.

The hatch pops up a handspan before the hook-blade, still jammed, torques and spits free. A gloved hand snakes in, fingers clawing for purchase. Light from below knifes into the service space in a hard rectangle, and a voice follows it—hook-man, satisfied: “There. Got you.”

You are in the crawl, moving, but they now have an open gap and line of sight into the upper space you just left, and they know exactly which way you went.

### Turn 200 [PLAYER]

I crawl fast after Rusk, keeping low and quiet. “Rusk—how far to a junction or drop? Any grate, vent, anything.” 

As I move, I pat the walls and ceiling for a loose panel, latch, or side slit I can pull shut behind us; if I find anything, I yank it free and jam it in the crawl to slow whoever comes in after.

*Agent reasoning: They’ve got sight and will follow; this crawl is a choke point, so I need distance and a way to slow them without getting trapped. I also need to know if there are branches/exits ahead before committing.*

### Turn 201 [GAME]

You knife forward after Rusk, elbows and knees working in short, ugly strokes. The crawl is just wide enough to breathe if you turn your face sideways; tar flakes and grit grind into your sleeves. Ahead, Rusk’s boots scuff, then pause.

“Junction,” he whispers back, voice thin with exertion. “Maybe ten—twelve feet. After that… a drop. Ladder, I think. Heard air moving.”

Behind you, the hatch space you left coughs sound into the conduit: a man hauling himself up, boots finding purchase, metal scraping brick. Not running yet—careful. They don’t want to get stuck.

You sweep the walls and ceiling with your free hand as you crawl. Most of it is old brick and patched mortar, damp and slick. Then your fingers catch something that isn’t masonry: a narrow, corroded sheet-metal access cover set into the right wall, about the size of a ledger, held by two bent tabs. It’s already loose—someone’s been in here before.

You hook your fingertips under the edge and yank. The cover peels free with a sharp metallic rasp that echoes down the crawl like a shout. Rusk freezes, then keeps going faster.

You twist and jam the sheet-metal panel crosswise in the crawl behind you, wedging it between brick and ceiling. It holds—barely—bowing in the middle. It won’t stop a determined man, but it will force them to slow, to wriggle and curse and make noise.

Immediately, a gloved hand smacks into it from the far side. The panel flexes with a booming clang. A voice—closer now, breathy with the squeeze—spits, “They threw a plate. Get a light up here.”

Another thud. The panel shudders; one tab starts to slip, scraping mortar dust into your hair.

Rusk reaches the junction ahead—an older conduit intersection where the space opens enough to turn your shoulders. “Here,” he hisses. “Drop’s right there—don’t look down too long.”

You’ve bought seconds, not safety. The metal behind you is already bending.

### Turn 202 [PLAYER]

I shove through into the junction and flatten against the wall, listening down the drop for voices or water before committing. “Rusk—go first, fast but quiet; tell me what you see at the bottom.” 

I grab the sheet-metal panel and wedge it tighter at the crawl mouth, then as soon as it buys even a heartbeat, I swing onto the ladder and start down, keeping my body close to the rungs and my ear angled up for them forcing through.

*Agent reasoning: They’re seconds behind and squeezing through; the drop might be the only disengage point. I need to avoid getting caught mid-ladder, so I’ll listen for distance/voices, then commit fast with Rusk leading while I cover the top for a beat.*

### Turn 203 [GAME]

You flatten in the junction and lean over the ladder drop without committing your weight. Air moves up from below—cooler, wet. No splash of open water, but you catch a slow, rhythmic drip and the faint clink of something hanging loose down there.

Voices too: muffled, not right under you. Two men, somewhere off to the left at the bottom or in an adjacent run—words swallowed by brick, but the cadence is casual. They’re already down there.

Rusk doesn’t hesitate. He slips onto the ladder and starts down fast, keeping his shoulders tight to the rails. “I’ll call it,” he whispers.

You snatch the sheet-metal panel and wedge it harder at the crawl mouth. It bites for half a second—then something on the other side rams it with a shoulder. The panel bows with a deep gong, and one edge skates, shaving mortar. A hand hooks over the top, fingers curling, trying to peel it back.

No more time.

You swing onto the ladder and descend, body close, boots finding rungs by feel. Above, metal shrieks as the panel gets dragged aside a few inches. A harsh voice barks, right at the opening now: “DOWN. They went down—”

Rusk reaches the last third of the ladder and pauses just long enough to look. His head jerks back up. “Two—” he starts to say.

A flashlight beam snaps on below, stabbing up the shaft. It catches Rusk’s face, then yours, bleaching you both in hard white. A man’s voice carries clearly now, close and surprised: “Hey! Up there!”

Rusk drops the last few rungs in a controlled slide and hits the bottom with a wet slap of boots on slime-slick brick. He turns sideways, making room, one hand up like he’s about to grab your ankle and yank you down.

You’re still on the ladder, halfway into the light, with the “Safety” men above forcing into the junction and at least two men below now alerted and aiming a beam straight up the drop. You can hear the upper climber’s boots scrape into the junction behind you—seconds from the ladder mouth.

### Turn 204 [PLAYER]

I squint into the beam and flick my hook-blade down at it—aiming to smack or cut the flashlight/hand—then I slide the rest of the way down in a controlled drop to Rusk. “Move—left, now. Don’t stop for a fight.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re pinched from above and below; I need to break line-of-sight and buy a second without getting stuck on the ladder. A quick disable of the light and a fast drop keeps momentum, then we move immediately to cover.*

### Turn 205 [GAME]

You snap your wrist and send the hook-blade down the shaft like a mean little pendulum.

It catches the flashlight first—metal on metal—knocking the beam sideways into the wall. The light cartwheels out of the man’s hand and clatters across the slick floor, spinning a wild strobe across pipes and boots. The man yelps and jerks back, more startled than hurt.

But the blade’s return arc kisses skin on the way back up—there’s a sharp, wet sound and a quick shout. “Ah—shit! My hand!”

You don’t wait to see more. You clamp your forearms to the rails and slide the last stretch, boots skidding the rungs, then drop the final couple feet into a crouch beside Rusk. The floor is brick, slimed with algae; your landing splashes cold water up your shins.

“Left,” you hiss.

Rusk is already moving. He grabs your sleeve and pulls you into a low run along the left-hand runnel where the conduit opens into a wider service passage—pipes overhead, a cable tray along the wall, and a dangling chain that ticks as you brush past.

Behind you, the man you disarmed scrambles for the fallen flashlight. Another voice—different, steadier—barks, “Don’t chase blind. Get the light. Get the light!”

Above, boots hit the ladder. The upper “Safety” man starts down fast, rungs clanging. You can hear his partner at the top: “I’m coming—keep eyes on ’em!”

As you and Rusk cut left, the recovered flashlight beam sweeps after you, catching your backs for a moment. The wounded man’s voice turns mean. “They went left—LEFT!”

You’ve bought a breath of darkness, not distance. They have lights, they have numbers, and now they have your direction.

### Turn 206 [PLAYER]

I tug Rusk down under the cable tray and hiss, “Kill silhouette—stay low.” As we move, I sweep my hand along the wall for a valve wheel, junction box, or any loose chain/pipe we can yank to make noise or drop something behind us; if I find a valve, I crank it hard to vent or spray and then keep moving. “Rusk—next turn, cross-passage, or any place to hide for ten seconds?”

*Agent reasoning: They’ve got lights and numbers; a straight run just lets them track us. I need a quick choke point or a way to break line-of-sight—preferably something in this pipe-and-cable corridor we can sabotage without stopping long.*

### Turn 207 [GAME]

You pull Rusk down under the cable tray. Both of you hunch low; the tray’s shadow breaks your outline, and the overhead pipes give the flashlight beam too many angles to read clean.

Your left hand skates the wall as you move—brick slick with condensation, then cold painted metal. You find a junction box first: old, riveted, with a loose latch. You slap it closed as you pass—*clang*—not helpful.

Three steps later your fingers catch a wheel: a small valve, half-seized, tagged with flaking red paint. You plant your shoulder, crank hard.

It gives with a reluctant groan—and then *hisses*. Not steam. Pressurized water. A hard, sideways jet spits from a cracked coupling further down the pipe run, turning the passage into a cold, white spray that catches the flashlight beam like fog. The floor immediately turns to glass.

Behind you, one of the men swears as his beam turns into glare. “Goddamn—watch your—” A boot slips; there’s a sharp skid and a knee hits brick. “—SHIT!”

The pursuing light wobbles, then steadies lower, trying to cut under the spray. The man with the hurt hand is breathing loud now, angry and close, but he’s slower—favoring it.

Rusk leans in as you keep moving, voice tight. “Cross-passage in twenty feet—right. It’s narrower. Dead-ends after a bend, but there’s a service recess—two men could tuck in, maybe ten seconds if they don’t sweep it right.” He points with two fingers without lifting his head. “Or—there’s a ladder up at the end of this run, but it’s exposed.”

A flashlight beam stabs through the water haze again, lower this time, searching for feet. You hear the ladder climber from above reach the bottom—boots slapping into the wet—adding another light and another set of eyes.

They’re not guessing anymore; they’re advancing in a stagger, using the spray as cover and hazard both.

### Turn 208 [PLAYER]

I pull Rusk into the right cross-passage and whisper, “Recess—now. Quiet.” We tuck into the service recess, kill our breathing, and I keep my hook-blade low, listening for how many sets of boots pass and whether any of them peel off to check the side run. If they overshoot, I motion Rusk to backtrack a few steps and slip past them through the spray while their lights are pointed forward.

*Agent reasoning: The ladder is exposed and likely a choke point with lights on us. The recess gives a brief chance to break line-of-sight and let them pass or split their formation, but it’s risky if they sweep. Use the spray and slick floor to slow them, then hide briefly and listen for numbers/positions before moving.*

### Turn 209 [GAME]

You haul Rusk into the right-hand cross-passage. The air changes immediately—staler, less moving. The bend comes quick; you tuck into the service recess: a shallow bite in the wall half-hidden by a vertical pipe and a hanging loop of chain. You press in until brick bites your shoulder blades.

You still your breath. Rusk does the same, jaw clenched, one hand braced on the pipe to keep from slipping.

Boots approach in the main run—three sets, distinct.

First man: careful now, testing the slick with short steps. His flashlight beam skates along the spray, then drops to the floor, tracking for prints. Second man: heavier, impatient, beam higher, sweeping walls and tray shadows. Third man: the one from above, moving like he’s been in these runs before—his light doesn’t wander; it *checks*.

They pass the mouth of your cross-passage.

Then the third man stops dead.

His beam snaps sideways into the right-hand opening—straight down your cross-passage. Not into the recess, but close enough that the reflected light glances off the wet chain beside you, making it twitch and glimmer.

He doesn’t come in. He just says, low and certain, to the others: “This side run’s warm. Hold. I want the back covered.”

A second beam joins his, angling in to overlap. They’re setting a crossfire of light at the entrance—waiting for movement.

From the main run, the wounded man’s voice rides up, tight with pain: “They’re in there. They’re in there—”

The heavier one answers, annoyed. “Shut up. You don’t know that.”

The third man does. You hear him shift his stance, boots widening for traction. “One of you—go around. If there’s a dead-end recess, they’ll be sitting in it.”

Something metallic scrapes—like a baton or a length of pipe being dragged off the wall. Footsteps peel away from the main run and start down the cross-passage toward the bend, slow and deliberate, light held low to catch shadows at ankle height.

You don’t have an overshoot to exploit. They’ve checked, they’re holding the mouth with lights, and one is coming in to clear the bend—closing on your recess within seconds.
