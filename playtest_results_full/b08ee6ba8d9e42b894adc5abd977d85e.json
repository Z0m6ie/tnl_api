      "content": "Morning, low tide, at the **Junction of Nine**—a ring of half-submerged service platforms where four maintenance corridors meet under a cracked transit atrium. Salt-stale air hangs heavy. Water slaps the stairwell below, then sucks back, dragging grit. Your headlamp beam catches blistered paint and a curtain of dripping cable.\n\nYou kneel on a dry patch of poured concrete and unroll your waterlogged utility sheets on a rusted cable tray. The paper fights you, swollen and soft. You pin corners with bolts from your pocket and mark a new line with a grease pencil: a bypass around a collapsed pump room, measured by count and slope like you’re back in a survey crew. You check ceiling seams for fresh seep and tap a conduit with your wrench—listening for hollow, for hidden voids.\n\nBoots scrape behind you. Three people step into the light: a Tidewarden in a patched dive coat with an air-hose looped over one shoulder; a thin Choir tech with a handheld meter and copper token chain; and a Rebar Court bailiff with a rebar baton and a slate board. They don’t look at each other. They look at your maps.\n\nThe bailiff flips the slate toward you. Your name is chalked under a stamped seal: **SALVAGE WRIT—STOLEN INFRASTRUCTURE**. “Court says you return what you took,” he says, baton resting across his forearm. The Tidewarden cuts in, voice calm. “We can make that go away. Air credit, a dry corridor. You come talk to our captain.” The Choir tech raises the meter; its needle trembles. “No talk,” she says. “Verification. Now. You have something that sings upland.”\n\nThen you see it: on the pillar beside the north tunnel, a fresh stenciled mark—new paint, wrong code—half-hidden under algae smear. And from the flooded shaft below the atrium comes the same rhythmic banging, closer than yesterday, steady as a pump that won’t prime.\n\nAll three wait, blocking three exits. Your maps are open, your pack is at your feet, and the ceramic isolator is a hard weight against your ribs. You have seconds to choose who you face—and whether you move before the banging reaches the stairs.",

The pack strap catches, then slides onto your shoulder with a jolt that knocks your headlamp beam sideways across the pillar.\n\n“Move,” you bark.\n\nThe bailiff reads the feint as compliance for half a heartbeat—his baton dips—then you cut hard. His eyes widen and he lunges, rebar baton swinging low for your shin. It clips your boot instead of bone, sparks off a metal edge, and you stumble but keep your feet.\n\nThe Tidewarden reacts faster than the others: he steps across the north tunnel mouth, blocking it with his shoulder and the looped air-hose like a garrote. “No,” he says, flat. He grabs for your coat front.\n\nYou slam into him at speed. Your shoulder drives him back a step onto slick silt; his boots skid. The Choir tech doesn’t chase—she raises her meter and snaps two short words that sound like procedure, not a prayer. The needle pegs, and your headlamp flickers once, then steadies—like something just drank a bite of current nearby.\n\nYour beam catches the fresh stencil in full as you pass it: the same wrong-code mark, painted over old flake, still glossy at the edges. Under it, someone has scratched a tiny arrow pointing deeper into the north tunnel.\n\nBehind you, the bailiff shouts, “Writ in force! Stop her!” He’s coming, heavy-footed. The Tidewarden, off-balance, recovers and reaches again—fingers snagging your pack strap. The strap bites into his hand; he yanks, trying to pull you back into the atrium.\n\nThen the banging changes: not below anymore. It answers from inside the north tunnel—two impacts, a pause, two impacts—close enough you feel it through the concrete.\n\nAhead, the north corridor is half-lit by your lamp: a maintenance run with hanging cable bundles and a shallow sheet of water over the floor. Fifty feet in, something pale breaks the surface and slides back under—fast, deliberate—leaving a V-wake through scum.\n\nYou are not clear yet. The Tidewarden has your strap, the bailiff is closing, and whatever is making that rhythm is now in the tunnel with you.",

He grunts—more surprised than hurt—then immediately clamps both hands on it like it’s evidence. “Fine,” he spits, and you hear the hose on his shoulder clack as he turns back toward the atrium, already calling, “She ditched her load—north tunnel!”\n\nYou sprint. The shallow water tries to steal your boots with every step, but you hit the wall and jump, fingers catching a corroded cable tray support and a rung of an old side-ladder bolted into the concrete. Rust flakes into your palms. The first rung flexes; it holds.\n\nYou haul yourself up and start moving sideways and forward along the ladder line, boots scraping for purchase on narrow brackets just above the waterline. Below you, something moves again—pale, quick—tracking the line of your shadow more than your body. It bumps the wall once, hard, and the vibration shivers up the ladder into your arms.\n\nBehind, the bailiff enters the tunnel mouth and stops short when he sees you climb. “Get down!” he barks, baton raised like it can reach you. He won’t wade in fast; he keeps to the dry edge, scanning.\n\nAhead, you follow the scratched arrow. Twenty feet deeper, it points to a service recess: a metal access panel half-hidden behind hanging cable bundles. The panel’s bolts are newer than everything around it—clean heads, bright edges. Someone has been here recently.\n\nThe rhythmic banging is right under that recess now, from inside the wall or the flooded cavity behind it: two hits, pause, two hits—patient and close.\n\nAs you reach the recess, the ladder section you’re on gives a sharp creak. One of the brackets has pulled a few millimeters out of the concrete, leaving a fresh crescent of crumbling aggregate. If you keep your full weight on it much longer, it’s going to tear free.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_remove\":[\"pack (with any contents)\"],\"inventory_add\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Junction of Nine - North Tunnel\"],\"npcs_add\":[\"Tidewarden diver (unnamed)\",\"Rebar Court bailiff (unnamed)\",\"Catenary Choir tech (unnamed)\"]}\n```",

The ladder behind you gives a final protesting groan but doesn’t tear out—not yet.\n\n“Bailiff—stay out of the water unless you want it on you,” you snap.\n\nThe bailiff halts at the edge, eyes flicking to the water where the pale shape just traced another fast line under the scum. He swallows, then tries to save face by lifting his baton toward you like a gavel. “You’re under writ,” he says, but he doesn’t step in.\n\nYou get your wrench on the first new bolt. The head is clean, not rounded—whoever set it wanted it removable. Fast and sloppy works for the first two: they squeal and come free, dropping into the recess with sharp pings.\n\nOn the third, your wrench slips—your hand is wet, the rubber cable jacket smears against your palm—and you skin your knuckles on the panel edge. Blood beads immediately in the cold air.\n\nThe banging stops.\n\nFor a half-second there’s only the drip of cable and your breathing—then something hits the access panel from behind, hard. The metal bows outward with a dull *thoom* and rebounds. Dust puffs from the seam. The remaining bolts jump in their holes.\n\nBelow your boots, in the waterline at the recess mouth, the pale thing surfaces long enough for you to see it: not a fish. A forearm—human, swollen and bleached—ending in a hand that shouldn’t still have grip. It hooks fingers into the recess’s lower edge and pulls, steady and purposeful, as if it heard the bolt squeal and homed in on it.\n\nBehind you, from the tunnel mouth, the Tidewarden’s voice carries closer now, urgent. “Don’t open anything! Kestrel—step away from the panel!”\n\nThe bailiff takes one involuntary step back from the water, baton up, and says quieter, “What the hell is that?”\n\nThe access panel bulges again—two impacts, pause, two impacts—now coming from directly behind it, like something is testing the last fasteners. Your next wrench-turn will either open it… or leave you in a recess with a climbing hand at your feet and whatever’s inside the wall trying to get out.",

The bolts vanish under the scum with it.\n\n“Congrats—your writ can arrest that,” you bark.\n\nThe bailiff’s face tightens. He raises the baton like he’s about to answer—then the water near the recess dimples and slides, and he chooses distance instead. “Court doesn’t cover… *that*,” he mutters, backing toward the tunnel mouth without taking his eyes off the surface.\n\nYou shove off the recess lip and catch the wall supports again, moving fast. The bracket line shudders under your weight; rust flakes rain into the water. You keep your boots off the surface, skimming along narrow metal tabs and ladder rungs.\n\nBehind you, the access panel gives a long, ugly groan—metal flexing. A seam opens a finger-width with a sound like tearing foil. Something inside exhales a breath of warmer air that fogs the recess for an instant.\n\nThen the water answers: a sudden surge straight up at the recess mouth. The pale arm comes out higher than before, not grabbing blindly—reaching for the supports you’re using. Fingers rake the wall, miss your heel by inches, and slap back into the water with a loud smack.\n\nAhead, past the arrow, the wall supports continue—but the next section is partially collapsed: two rungs are missing, leaving a gap over the water about the length of your body. Beyond the gap, the tunnel bends left into darker conduit haze.\n\nFrom behind, the Tidewarden is closer now, boots splashing at the edge where the water is thinnest. He shouts, “Mara! Don’t—” and then cuts off as the water near him ripples in a straight line, moving away from the recess and toward the tunnel mouth like something is redirecting.\n\nThe threat is immediate and specific now: the thing in the water is learning your route along the wall, and you’ve got a rung-gap coming up that will force a jump or a drop—right as the surface starts to move toward the people behind you.",

You kick once against the wall, get a boot on a narrow tab, and haul your weight up without breaking the surface.\n\nYour headlamp beam, kept low, skates over the waterline. You catch a pale streak just under the film, pacing you—too smooth to be floating drift.\n\n“Back up, Tidewarden—it’s tracking movement on the wall!” you shout.\n\nThe Tidewarden, now visible at the edge behind the bailiff, hesitates mid-step. He lifts his hands as if to steady himself, then actually does back up two paces onto higher rubble. “Bull,” he calls, but his voice cracks on the last word. He’s watching the water, not you.\n\nThe bailiff uses the moment to retreat another step, baton lowered. “You hear her,” he snaps at the diver, then, softer, “Don’t be stupid.”\n\nYou keep moving into the left bend. The air changes immediately—less open tunnel, more enclosed conduit. The wall supports continue but are slicker here, coated in algae smear where the mist never dries. Your lamp reveals drag marks on the concrete at shoulder height, as if something heavy has been hauled along the wall recently.\n\nBehind you, metal shrieks: the access panel finally gives way. It doesn’t explode outward; it peels open with a slow, wrenching tear and then *clangs* against something inside. A breath of dry, warm air rolls down the tunnel—cleaner than it should be.\n\nThe water reacts as if a current turned on. The surface pulls toward the bend you’re entering, tugging floating grit with it in a thin, steady stream. The pale shape follows that pull, accelerating.\n\nThen the grab comes—not from below your feet, but from the wall itself ahead: a hand shoots out of a fist-sized maintenance hole at knee height, fingers snapping for your boot as you pass. It misses by a hair and scrapes rust off the bracket with a shrill *skrrt*.\n\nWhatever is in here isn’t just in the water anymore.

You’re now a full rung-and-a-half higher than before, boots planted on a narrow crosspiece, shoulders near the ceiling line.\n\nYour headlamp swings ahead and catches a side niche: an old valve recess cut into the wall about six meters forward, half-height, with a corroded wheel and a steel access door hanging slightly ajar on one hinge. It’s not sealed; it’s a place to duck, not a bunker.\n\nThe water below you is moving with intent now—streaming toward the bend.

You shove the valve wheel instead, trying to use the spokes as a brace point, but the wheel turns freely a quarter turn with a wet, internal gurgle. Somewhere behind the wall, water shifts.

The door shudders as you shove; the hinge squeals, but the strap takes up most of the space. It’s not airtight, but it’s enough to deny a clean reach-through.\n\n“Alive—moving!” your shout bounces down the tunnel.\n\nThe Tidewarden answers immediately, closer than you thought: boots scraping, not running but repositioning. “Copy! Don’t go dark—” he starts, then cuts himself off as if realizing you already might.\n\nYou kill your headlamp.\n\nDark snaps shut like a fist. In the first second, you’ve got only afterimages: the doorway rectangle, the sheen of water.\n\nYou slip back out onto the wall supports by feel. Your hands find the cold metal; you swing a boot onto the crosspiece and push into the bend.\n\nThe supports betray you almost immediately. The rung you load gives a sharp, tearing *krk* as its anchor pulls another centimeter out of the concrete. You catch yourself with your forearms, scraping skin, and keep moving—faster now because stopping will drop you.\n\nBelow, the waterline sounds change: less slosh, more deliberate scraping as something tracks the wall right under you.

The strap wedge holds, but each hit makes the hinge complain.\n\nAhead, in the bend, you smell it before you see it: dry dust and hot metal. A faint, steady hum—electrical, not wind—threads through the dark. Then your shin clips something hanging from the ceiling: a loop of cable or wire, swaying. It brushes your leg and continues to swing, ticking softly against a bracket.\n\nAnd in that same moment, something in the water surges forward under you, fast enough to throw a small wave against the wall. The splash hits the supports; droplets patter on your boots.\n\nYou’re in the bend now, moving blind, with failing anchors behind you, a thing pacing below, and a live-sounding hum ahead that could mean power—or a trap.  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[\"belt/strap\"],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

Half of it is intact and dry; the far section dips where a stanchion has sheared, the grating twisted down toward the water. Above the catwalk is a junction box alcove: a recessed cabinet with its door missing, exposing ceramic insulators and a bundle of blackened conductors. The hum you heard is coming from there—faint, steady, and wrong for a dead district.\n\nIn that same flash you also catch the hanging “cable” you clipped: it isn’t loose utility line. It’s a looped length of catenary wire with a ceramic isolator tied in-line—cleaner than the rest, recently handled. It’s been hung deliberately at shin height like a snare.\n\nYou reach up and yank it aside.\n\nThe wire doesn’t give like slack line; it bites back. It snaps taut and the ceramic isolator swings up and smacks the bracket near your head with a sharp *clack*. The loop whips across your forearm, scraping hard—then the whole rig jerks toward the junction alcove as if it’s tethered there. Something in the box clicks once, like a relay engaging.\n\nThe hum rises a notch.\n\nBelow you, the water surges again—this time not just a wave. A shoulder or back breaks the surface under the catwalk section, sliding fast. It’s using the wall and your supports like a guide rail, keeping pace with your movement.\n\nYou don’t wait. You hook an elbow over the nearest catwalk stanchion and haul yourself up off the failing brackets. The grating is cold and gritty under your boots—dry enough to trust for now. The twisted, sagging section is about four meters ahead; you can see where it drops toward the water like a ramp.\n\nBehind you, from the dark, the Tidewarden’s voice carries closer and sharper: “Light! I saw it—keep it on, I’m coming to you!”\n\nFrom the junction alcove, you hear a second, softer sound layered under the hum: that same rhythmic tapping you heard earlier—now right here, answering from inside the wall cavity behind the cabinet.",

Your hands close on the first pair and you rip.\n\nThe hum doesn’t die. It *jumps*—a higher pitch—and the cable in your grip kicks like a live animal. A white-blue snap pops at the lug and heat bites your palm. The smell of ozone and burnt rubber blooms instantly.\n\nYou wrench again, harder, and the second pull tears a conductor free. This time the hum stutters, drops for half a second… then comes back lower, steadier. Whatever’s feeding it isn’t only this cabinet.\n\nFrom behind the cabinet, inside the wall void, the tapping accelerates: *tap-tap-tap-tap*—close enough you feel it through the concrete.\n\nBelow the catwalk, the thing in the water reacts to the commotion. It surges forward and *hits* the sagging section from underneath.

A pale shape rolls just under the surface—long back, no clear limbs—using the catwalk’s shadow like cover.\n\nThe Tidewarden, still back in the tunnel, doesn’t come closer. You hear him unclip something—metal on metal—and he shouts, “Stay there!

I’m backing out.” You hear him retreat—boots on grit, then a splash as he steps off the drier lip into shallow water to widen his path away from the wall. A moment later: the hiss of a valve and the hollow *clunk* of a tank being shouldered. He’s not leaving; he’s repositioning.\n\nYou keep moving.\n\nThe intact catwalk runs straight for another ten meters before it doglegs left around a support pier. Your headlamp stays low, beam scraping the grating and the base of the wall-run. The humming line is clearly visible now: a bundled conduit strapped to the concrete with fresh metal bands—newer than anything else here. Every few meters a ceramic standoff insulator keeps it off the wall.\n\nAhead, you find three things in quick succession:\n\n1) **A ladder up**: bolted rungs disappearing into a ceiling hatch. The hatch is shut, and there’s a **fresh smear of sealant** around its rim—recent, not cracked. Someone has been through and tried to keep it dry.\n\n2) **A painted mark** on the pier at the dogleg: the same stenciled symbol you’ve been seeing—partly scrubbed, then repainted over.\n\n3) **Another snare**: a thin, dark line stretched at ankle height across the catwalk just before the dogleg. It’s not catenary wire this time—looks like braided cord or stripped cable jacket, tied off to the conduit bands on the humming wall-run. If you’d kept your pace, you’d have hit it.\n\nBelow you, the pale shape tracks your movement. It stays just under the surface, parallel to the catwalk, and when you reach the dogleg it *bumps* the underside of the grating directly beneath the snare—testing, like it knows where you are.\n\nFrom behind, the Tidewarden calls again, closer than he should be if he was “backing out.” He’s moved to a new angle. “Engineer! Don’t climb. That hatch is Court-sealed in this sector. You go up there, you’ll have every bailiff in Nine on you.”\n\nThe tapping you heard earlier answers from inside the pier at your left—right behind the painted mark—slow and deliberate now, like knuckles on the other side of a door.",

The conduit bands along the wall-run shiver, and the ceramic standoffs give a tiny *tick… tick…* as they flex. Whatever this line is feeding, it just noticed you.\n\nBelow, your headlamp angled down catches movement: the pale shape in the water slides to the base of the ladder well and rises until it presses against the underside of the catwalk. You see a long, smooth back break the surface for a second—no eyes, no clear mouth—just a wet ridge and a sudden *thump* as it rams the grating once, hard, directly under your feet.\n\nThe ladder vibrates. You keep climbing.\n\nBehind you, the Tidewarden ignores your order. You hear him advance at a jog, then stop short of the snare. “Mara—don’t—” he starts, then cuts himself off as the water below the catwalk surges.

The Tidewarden fires: a compressed *THUNK* and a line snaps out, striking the water with a splash. The creature rolls away from the impact, but it doesn’t flee; it circles back under the ladder’s shadow.\n\nFrom inside the pier, the grinding stops.

The jolt shoots up your shins and nearly pitches you forward, but you catch yourself in a crouch and drive into a sprint.\n\n“Keep it off the ladder,” you snap.\n\nThe Tidewarden doesn’t answer with words—he plants his feet wide, braces his harpoon rig against the ladder frame, and yanks the line tight like he’s trying to turn the whole ladder into a barrier. “MOVE!” he barks, voice cracking with effort.\n\nYou reach the cracked maintenance panel by the painted mark. Up close it’s not a normal access door—its screws are new, mismatched, and the seam has been cut and re-sealed. The ozone smell is stronger here.\n\nYou jam your burned hand into the seam.\n\nThe sealant tears with a wet *rip*—and pain knifes up your wrist as the softened skin catches on a sharp, freshly-ground edge. You wrench anyway. The panel pops outward an inch, then fights you on a hidden tether.\n\nInside is a narrow service void, dry and dusted with concrete flour. A bundle of newer cable—black jacket, clean—runs into a small relay cradle bolted to the inner wall. There’s a faint green indicator LED glowing steady.\n\nAnd there’s a second thing in there: a trip-strip—thin spring steel—set across the opening at finger height. When you yank the panel wider, it snaps free with a *ping*.\n\nImmediately, somewhere above and behind the pier, you hear a relay *clack* answer it.\n\nThe hum in the wall-run rises a notch, and the painted mark beside you—half-scrubbed—shows a fresh edge where something has recently been traced over.\n\nThe Tidewarden’s line jerks violently. The pale thing hits again, not the ladder this time—the catwalk stanchion. The whole section shudders, and rusty flakes rain down into the black water.\n\nFrom the service void, a thin speaker you didn’t see at first emits a dry burst of static, then a human voice—close, controlled, and very calm:\n\n“Hands out of the cradle, Mara Kestrel.”\n\nNo one is visible in the void. The voice is coming from the little box itself.",

Don’t touch the load path.”\n\nYou lean in just enough to sweep your lamp into the service void.\n\nThe beam shows a crawlspace continuation—tight, rectangular, maybe shoulder-width—running left for a few meters before it kinks downward. There’s a proper handhold rail riveted along the inner lip, and a quick-release latch on a second inner panel… but it’s been wired shut with fresh catenary tie and a wax seal stamped with the upland substation sigil. Whoever did this expected someone like you to look.\n\nYour lamp also catches the relay cradle: ceramic standoffs, a neat coil of new wire, and a small microphone puck. That green LED is steady, not blinking—live and listening.\n\nYou shout to the Tidewarden to fall back to the dogleg.\n\nHe tries. He unhooks the harpoon rig from the ladder frame and starts shuffling backward along the catwalk, line still tight. “Dogleg—NOW!” he yells, but the movement gives the thing in the water slack.\n\nIt uses it.\n\nA pale arm—too long, jointed wrong—hooks up through the grating at the stanchion he just left. Fingers like wet cable ties clamp around the vertical support and *pull*. The stanchion buckles with a metallic groan. The catwalk section between you and the dogleg dips a full handspan, bolts popping one after another like knuckles.\n\nThe Tidewarden stumbles, catches the rail, and drags himself onto the more stable dogleg platform, but the harpoon line whips loose and slaps the water—no longer keeping the thing off the ladder or anything else.\n\nThe voice in the wall speaks again, closer in your ear through the tiny speaker: “If that span drops, you don’t get a second chance.

If you fry me, I haunt your substation.”\n\nFrom the speaker: a quiet exhale, then, “Don’t be dramatic. Go.”\n\nYou shoulder the inner panel.

The edges scrape concrete; the space is tight enough that your packless shoulders still wedge. Your lamp beam stutters as it bumps the wall, then steadies, painting the crawlspace in a harsh cone.\n\nBehind you, the catwalk span finally lets go—*not* the whole thing, but a section. A row of bolts shears and the grating drops with a shriek, slamming into the water and throwing up a cold spray that hits your boots and calves as you pull in. The sound is immediate: water slapping through the new hole, metal chattering against metal.\n\nThe Tidewarden, on the dogleg, does exactly what you told him—he doesn’t follow.

Your lamp is angled down; the beam finds the landing before your soles do.\n\nIt’s a vertical service shaft, about two meters down. Dry. The floor is a grated platform over a deeper void, with a narrow ledge of poured concrete on the left wall—enough to stand on if you keep your weight close. The cable you’ve been following continues down through a conduit throat and disappears below the grating.\n\nYou ease down fast. Your boots touch the grating and it flexes—old steel, but not failing. When you shift your weight onto it, it holds.\n\nYour lamp catches two important details immediately:\n\n1) **Side access**: on the left wall, shoulder height, there’s a rectangular hatch with a recessed handle. It’s been opened recently—scrape marks around the handle, and the hinge pins are shiny.\n\n2) **A threat**: on the far side of the shaft, opposite the hatch, there’s a small motion sensor puck and a pinhole camera set into a newer plate. A red indicator blinks once as your light sweeps it, then goes steady.\n\nThe calm voice comes again, now clearer, as if the speaker is in this shaft too: “Good. Stay off the center of the grate. Third bar from the left is cracked.”\n\nAs if to underline it, something below the grating **hits the underside**—not the pale thing from the water (this is dry), but a heavy, rhythmic *thunk* from deeper in the shaft. Dust puffs up through the grate. The impact is patient, repeated, like someone testing the same spot.\n\nFrom behind you—muffled and more distant now—the Tidewarden is still making noise, but his banging has changed pace: faster, panicked. “Kestrel—IT’S CLIMBING—” His words cut off into a wet scramble and a sharp metallic crash.\n\nThen he’s loud again, forced loud: “Still here!

Don’t move—”\n\nA second voice answers her, muffled like it’s behind a respirator: “You want me to cut it?”\n\nSable: “No. If we cut it, she keeps the hook.”\n\nThen: the distinct sound of a **blade on line** anyway—someone’s sawing carefully, not to free you, but to free *their* tool without yanking the mouth down. The line vibrates against the cable bundle under your boot.\n\nYou belly-slide deeper. The trench narrows and angles slightly downward. Your lamp slit catches a run of cable tags—old municipal—then a newer painted mark: that same **stenciled symbol** you saw on the hatch, repeated small on the trench wall as if guiding someone who knows it.\n\nBehind you, the sawing continues for two seconds… then stops. A soft *snap* follows—not a clean cut. The line breaks under tension.\n\nThe hook stays **in the crawl lip**. The loose end of line whips back toward them out in the corridor.\n\nSable’s voice follows you, sharper and no longer pretending calm: “She’s in the trench! She’s heading tramline-side—call it in!”\n\nYou gain distance, but you’ve left a metal hook embedded at the mouth like a marker, and you’ve just confirmed your route to at least two Choir operatives. The irritant is weaker down here, but your eyes still burn and your chest is tight; any hard exertion risks a cough that carries in the confined trench.",

The opening is barely shoulder-wide, but it’s there. You peel in sideways, ribs scraping concrete, and pull the cover back into place from inside until it settles with a dull *thunk*. From the trench side it looks closed again—just another dirty lid.\n\nYou go still and listen.\n\nAt first: nothing but your own breathing and the faint far-off banging through structure.\n\nThen, from back the way you came: **two** distinct sets of contact sounds—one heavier, one lighter—scraping and bumping along the trench. They’re not belly-sliding as cleanly as you did; you hear cable ties snap and grit dragged, and once, a muffled curse.\n\nSable’s voice carries down the trench, closer now, controlled again: “Easy. Don’t pull on anything—there’s a drop somewhere.”\n\nThe second voice, still respirator-muffled: “Hook’s gone. Line’s gone. She’s ahead.”\n\nThey stop near where your handhole is—close enough that the cover above you ticks as grit shifts under someone’s weight. A flashlight beam knifes past the lid’s seam in a thin, accidental line, then moves on. The heavier one taps the trench wall with something metal—*tink… tink…*—testing for hollows.\n\nSable, right over you or just past: “She knows these. Check lids.”\n\nA hand scrapes across the cover’s edge. The lid shifts a hair—enough to sprinkle dust into your hair—but it doesn’t lift. After a second, the hand moves away.\n\nThey continue forward, past you, their scrapes receding toward tramline-side.\n\nYou wait them out. When their sounds thin and the trench goes quiet again, you ease the cover up a finger-width and look through the seam: empty trench, their light now a distant smear.\n\nMoving toward the tramline junction is possible now, but you’ve learned two things: they’re willing to crawl the trench after you, and they’re actively checking for hides—if they loop back, this handhole won’t stay safe twice.\n\n```json\n{\"locations_add\":[\"Marked handhole (cable trench hide)\"]}```",

You reverse direction and drive yourself forward, fast. Your earlier grit-kick and cable yank did what you wanted: the trench behind you is rougher now, and you can feel it—snag points, loose loops, places to catch a knee. You power through them anyway.\n\nHalfway back, you hear it: a new sound layered over the distant banging—water moving where it shouldn’t. Not a wave, not drip. A thin, steady *glug-glug* like a siphon catching.\n\nThen the trench floor gives a little under your weight—silt liquefying. Your forearm plunges to the elbow into cold slurry and you have to wrench it free. The lamp slit wobbles; your beam catches a hairline seam in the trench wall where the newer sealant is peeling.\n\nYou keep going.\n\nAt the crawl mouth, the embedded hook is still there, canted at an angle like a thorn.

The corridor is narrow; if she gets her foot on the lip, you’re pinned half-in, half-out.\n\nAt the same moment, the *glug* behind you becomes a sudden *rush*—the trench you just belly-slid through starts taking water, fast, as if a valve or pocket gave way. Cold water pushes at your legs from inside the crawl, trying to shove you out into the corridor… or trap you if the mouth gets blocked.\n\nYou have a heartbeat of advantage: you’re already at the lip, shoulders out.

He lunges past, pry bar up like a baton, trying to cut the corridor angle and tag you as you accelerate. The bar whistles and *clangs* off the wall a handspan from your shoulder as you duck your lamp and drive forward.\n\nBehind you, Sable snarls through pain, “Don’t—let—her—” then she sucks a breath and shouts, louder, “Mark her route! Don’t chase blind!”\n\nThe flooding trench makes its own announcement: a rising, hollow roar as water fills the cable run and burps air back out of the crawl mouth. It’s loud enough to smear your footfalls for a moment—good cover—but it also means that crawl is about to become a sluice, and anything connected to it may start taking water.\n\nYou sprint toward the tramline junction.

You yank.\n\nNothing—then it gives a centimeter with a gritty squeal you can’t fully smother. The panel is heavier than it should be, and it’s stuck on swollen guides. You brace and haul again. It opens enough to slip your head and one shoulder into a narrow utility alcove: a service drop with a ladder down into black.\n\nYou don’t climb so much as fall onto the first rungs and slide down fast, palms burning. Above, you drag the panel toward closed; it doesn’t seat flush, but it narrows to a finger gap.

Upland stamp. Don’t play dumb.”\n\nThey know exactly what you took.\n\nYour slide buys you distance, but not safety. Ten feet down the pipe, something *hits you*—a hand or tool hooking your ankle. You jerk, lose friction, and drop the last stretch uncontrolled. You slam into shallow water with your side and forearm, hard enough to knock air out of you.

He plants his feet wide, light pinned on you and the cradle. “Don’t,” he says, voice gone flat. “That’s not a toy. You arc it, you cook us all.”\n\nHe raises one hand, palm out, the other still holding his lamp.

Your forearm wound slicks your grip; blood smears the harness.\n\nBehind you, the hatch end isn’t just footsteps anymore.

Your steps ring. The shielded figure stumbles on the grate; you keep them upright by the harness and don’t slow.\n\nAt thirty, there’s the recess: a shallow alcove on the left with a knee-high panel door and a corroded latch. Above it, stenciled in faded municipal block letters: **HANDHOLE / FEEDER TAP**. The door sits proud by a finger’s width—warped, not fully seated.\n\nThe shielded figure plants a boot and kicks. The latch gives with a harsh snap; the door swings inward on one hinge, scraping concrete. A breath of colder air spills out, carrying wet stone and old copper.\n\nInside is a cramped access crawl: shoulder-width, dropping down at a steep angle.

Concrete grinds; the door shifts a fraction.\n\nThe latch hardware is loose and half-ripped. You yank it down and twist it into place like a fake lock.

Half-flooded. Big enough to stand. There’s a ladder ring up—if it isn’t cut.”\n\nYou stay low and move. The concrete is damp here; grit turns to a slick paste. The shielded figure hesitates at the steeper drop, and you don’t wait—you drag them by the harness. Their knee pads scrape, loud in the tight space.\n\nOutside the panel, the fast clicking changes pitch—quicker, excited. Something *taps* the metal door from the other side, not a human test: a light, repeated pecking right along the seam you forced.\n\nThen a voice, farther down the corridor outside, calls: “It’s moving—hear it? In the wall.”\n\nAnother answers: “Listener’s got it. Don’t open. Find the next access and cut it off.”\n\nYou reach the cable bundle: thick, old catenary and feeders wrapped in cracked rubber, cinched with corroded straps. The side throat is a rectangular bite out of the wall, just big enough to worm through.

A faint static hiss rises.\n\nThe shielded figure catches it too and hisses, panicked, “Don’t—don’t press it—”\n\nToo late to undo the contact: a tiny blue spark snaps somewhere in the bundle, bright as a pinprick, and the handhole behind you answers with a sharp *clack*—a relay reacting to the fault.\n\nImmediately, outside, boots start moving again—fast. Someone shouts, “There! It tripped—second panel, downline!”\n\nYou’re in the side throat now, both of you, shoulders scraping. Ahead, the passage opens into a larger void: you can hear it—space and water—an echoing drip and the low lap of a half-flooded chamber.

Every drip lands loud.\n\n“Find the ladder ring—now.”\n\nThe shielded figure splashes one step, catches themselves, then moves with careful, short shuffles along the wall, palm skimming concrete. You do the same on the chamber edge where the water’s shallowest, forcing your breathing quiet.\n\nThey find it—fast. A rusted ladder ring set is bolted into the wall under a square ceiling hatch. But the top three rungs are gone, cut clean, and the hatch above has a new hasp welded across it. Someone sealed it from the other side.\n\nThe figure looks back at you and shakes their head once, tight and scared. “Cut.

The chamber answers with a low metallic shiver.\n\nYou shove through anyway and find the oval overflow opening by feel at waterline height. You ram your boots in first, then force your hips through. The concrete edge bites your thighs. Behind you, you haul the shielded figure in by the harness; their visor bumps the lip with a dull *clonk*. They stifle a sound, but it still escapes—small and wet.\n\nThe beam loses you as you get your bodies out of its direct line. In the culvert, it’s instantly tighter—shoulders scraping, water cold against your back. It slopes slightly downward; water runs in a thin, constant sheet beneath you.\n\nBack in the splice chamber, you hear the first pursuer step in—splash, careful. “They went into the racks—watch the lines.”\n\nThen a sharp *tink-tink-tink* as the crab-walker hits the cable curtain and starts probing it. The trailing wire goes taut.\n\nA second voice, closer now, says, “Listener’s on a leash. Follow it.”\n\nThe threat is immediate and concrete: they’re using the walker to lead them to the culvert mouth, and the leash-wire is already being drawn across the cables toward where you disappeared. If it catches the culvert lip, they’ll know the exact hole.\n\nIn the culvert, the shielded figure’s breathing is too fast—fogging their visor in short bursts. Ahead, the duct bends after a few body-lengths into darker flow, and you can hear a faint, distant rush—like water dropping into a larger drain.",

For a heartbeat there’s nothing—just the thin sheet of water sliding past your wrist and the echo of voices in the chamber.\n\nThen the leash-wire arrives.\n\nIt skates the culvert lip with a faint metallic hiss and taps your knuckles. You hook it and yank sideways, driving it down into the water and against the concrete edge, trying to foul it. The wire bites your palm—thin, sharp. You feel it cut skin.\n\nIn the splice chamber, the crab-walker reacts instantly: its clicking turns frantic, and it scrabbles at the curtain as the leash goes taut. You pull harder.\n\nThe wire doesn’t snap. It’s newer than it sounded—braided, with a stiff core. Instead, your yank drags the line across the culvert mouth and *saws* it against the lip. You get a moment of slack—enough to think you’ve bought it—\n\n—and then the line jerks back the other way, hard, as someone in the chamber hauls.\n\nYour arm slams into the culvert edge.

She’s in the overflow. Hook light—now.”\n\nWhite light floods the culvert mouth, angled in. It doesn’t reach the bend, but it turns the water between you and the opening into a bright ribbon that gives your position away by wake and shadow.\n\nThe shielded figure freezes ahead, then starts moving again when you bump their boot. Their breathing has steadied, but now it’s loud in the tight concrete.\n\nBehind you, you hear boots in the splice chamber shifting to the culvert, and metal clinks—someone handling hardware. The threat is immediate: they’ve confirmed your escape route and are preparing to push something into the duct (a grab hook or a line) to either snag you or force you deeper where the drop-sound is coming from.\n\nYour palm is bleeding into the flow, and the duct ahead slopes toward that distant rush.",

The sound of pursuit is still there, though—water noise plus human noise, closer than you’d like.\n\nFrom behind the bend, a voice snaps: “Light’s out! She killed it—she’s close!”\n\nAnother voice, lower and more controlled: “Keep the line. Feel the wall. Don’t chase the sound—follow the flow.”\n\nAhead, the outlet tunnel changes character: the ceiling drops. The air gap shrinks to a handspan in places, forcing you and the shielded figure into a half-submerged crawl. The current accelerates through the constriction, and the waterline rises to your chest when the floor dips.\n\nYour shielded companion hesitates at the first low section, instinctively lifting their head—and bangs their visor/faceplate on the concrete with a hollow *bonk*. They curse, muffled, and their knees slip. The flow tries to roll them sideways into the deeper channel.\n\nYou can keep them pinned to the wall by the harness, but the next thirty feet are a nasty choice made physical: stay high on the wall-ledge and scrape through the low air gap, or drop into the deeper center and risk being pushed under by the fast water and the constricted ceiling.\n\nBehind you, the rope line hisses again—closer. They’re rounding the bend by feel, and now they don’t need the crawler’s lamp to do it.",

You keep the shielded figure’s faceplate low and forward like you said, but the flow bucks over uneven concrete. A standing wave slaps you in the mouth and nose; you swallow brackish water and your throat locks for a second.\n\nThe shielded figure panics on instinct and tries to inhale at the wrong time. You feel it through their body: a sudden convulsion, a choke that turns into a muffled, wet cough inside the mask/hood. Their hands claw at your forearm and harness strap, not to fight you, but to find “up” that isn’t there.\n\nYou kick hard anyway, using your hips as a wedge to keep them from rolling. Something hard—rebar stump or broken aggregate—rakes your shin as you pass, tearing fabric and skin. The pain is sharp and immediate; warm blood threads into the cold flow.\n\nThree body-lengths in, the floor rises like you were hoping. The current lifts you both, and you get a pocket—an actual air gap you can use. You shove the shielded figure up first.\n\n“NOW,” you get out, more a rasp than a word.\n\nThey break the surface and suck air—ragged, wheezing.

The line goes taut with a twang.\n\nA voice—different from the earlier angry one, calmer—barks orders that carry through the water: “Don’t fight it. Let it take you through. Heads down. One at a time!”\n\nThey’re adapting.\n\nRight now, you and the shielded figure are in a short, cramped air pocket with the low ceiling still forcing you to crouch half-submerged.

Their whole body trembles with the effort.\n\nYou keep one fist in their harness and use the other to sweep the ceiling and left wall. Concrete—slime—then a seam. Your fingers find a metal edge: an old ladder rung set into the wall, half-buried in calcified silt. One rung, then another. Not a ladder up—more like a short maintenance “step” line leading into a rectangular bite in the wall.\n\nA side notch. Tight, but real.\n\nYou shove them into it first.

You yank hard; the strap slides free with a squeal, and they tumble into the notch on their knees, coughing they can’t hold back anymore. It’s wet and violent, echoing in the small space.\n\nYou follow, hauling yourself off the main flow. In the notch, the water is lower—thigh-deep—and the current is a sluggish swirl instead of a pull. You can both breathe without being forced under, but the air is hot-stale here, like a sealed utility void that’s been “closed” for years.\n\nOutside, in the main channel, you hear the rope team arrive at the air pocket you just left.

It’s a service crawl, rectangular and mean, sloping upward at a shallow angle. The first few feet are open enough to belly-crawl, then it necks down where old cable trays and mineral crust have narrowed it. Air moves through it: a faint draft that smells less like algae and more like dust and old insulation.\n\nYou shove them forward immediately. They go, scraping, shoulders catching.

Their shoulder finally pops past with a gritty scrape that makes them jerk; they almost gasp, but you press them onward.

New work in an old crawl.\n\nAt the notch entrance, the pursuers’ light vanishes for a beat as someone shifts position. A voice mutters, very near: “I’m going.”\n\nA bare forearm slides into the opening.

Your boot heel slams back into forearm and wrist. You feel bone under neoprene. The hand jerks, slaps the concrete, and withdraws with a choked hiss.\n\n“Fuck—she kicked—!” the crawler says, voice tight with pain.\n\nOutside, the leader barks instantly: “Hold him.

Not a full strike—more like a hungry bite—but it leaves a sharp, acrid smell and a blistering scorch mark.\n\nThe pursuer at the entrance freezes mid-curse.\n\n“—It’s live!” he yells, panic cutting through the bravado. “It’s fucking live in here!”\n\nOutside, the leader’s voice goes tight and controlled: “Back out.

You feel it through the harness: a tiny *tick* transmitted up the wire, too light to be a full snag but enough to pluck it.\n\nThe recessed wall box answers immediately.\n\nA sharp internal *click*, then a thin tone—barely audible, like a mosquito whine—starts pulsing in the conduit. Not loud, but unmistakably intentional. The copper X’s don’t move; nothing “springs.” This isn’t a snare meant to trip you physically. It’s an alarm and a locator.\n\nFrom behind, muffled through the bend, you hear the leader outside the entrance snap to it: “There—hear that? She’s on the instrumented run. Keep the dry line moving.

And the box you’re brushing past is likely the node that’s listening.\n\nYou do get past the first set of X’s without fully snagging them, but the conduit ahead continues with more filament runs—denser, closer together—leading deeper along the right wall.

Their eyes flare, then they nod once—understanding—and go still.\n\nYou scoop silt and fling it low into the groove just as the beam sweeps past. It doesn’t “blind” the light, but it turns the air into a gritty shimmer and makes the beam break up into a dirty cone. The sweep hesitates.\n\n“Dust—she’s close,” one of them says, and you hear boots stop short. Someone taps the wall with a hook-pole, testing.\n\nYou drag your partner deeper into the left notch and commit into the wet bypass. It’s narrower than it looked: a half-submerged side run where the wall bows inward and forces you sideways. You keep your bleeding foot high on the wall, toes flexed, trying not to let the torn heel touch the water.\n\nIt works—mostly. Your calf shakes from the strain, and you clip the water once with your heel. It stings like salt in a cut.\n\nAs you slide through, you shove loose debris toward the groove edge. The new spill from the recessed seam does the rest: water threads under the crust and starts chewing it from beneath. The edge you just left behind turns into a soft, collapsing lip. A chunk the size of a paving stone slumps away with a wet crack.\n\nThe pursuers reach the problem almost immediately.\n\n“Hold—floor’s going,” the lead voice barks. A boot steps onto the undermined edge anyway; it drops ankle-deep with a splash and a curse. The hook-pole jabs down, finds nothing solid, and the man yanks it back fast.\n\n“Bypass left,” someone else says, sure of it now. “She’s in the side run.”\n\nA second beam snaps toward the notch mouth—low, searching. It catches the churned water and the fresh scrape marks where you hauled your partner in. They’re not guessing anymore.\n\nThen the undercut you encouraged takes another bite. The seam-spill widens, and the bypass entrance starts to sag. Not a full collapse—yet—but the ceiling grit begins to rain down in steady peppering. Your partner flinches as small stones ping off their shoulder.\n\nYou’re moving, but the bypass is forcing you to go slow and sideways. Behind you, the entrance is becoming a collapsing choke point. In front, the bypass bends into darker water, and you can hear it: a low, continuous *gurgle* like it’s feeding into a larger drop.\n\n“Get the snare line,” the lead voice orders. “No—don’t step it. Anchor and probe.”\n\nThey’re setting up to follow you in without triggering whatever you woke.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Wet bypass side run (left)\"],\"npcs_add\":[]}```",

Long drop.\n\nYou jerk back and flatten to the wall, whispering “Stop.” Your partner freezes instantly, belt-hold tight enough to bruise.\n\nYou feel along the wall just upstream of the lip, searching for anything engineered—rungs, a seam, a maintenance notch. Your fingers catch a narrow vertical joint packed with old sealant, then—there—an inset rectangle: a recessed service pocket half a forearm wide, just above the waterline. Inside, two corroded ladder staples run down out of sight.\n\nYou shove your body into the pocket, shoulder first, and pull your partner in behind you.

The undertow doesn’t care about the mistake; it keeps hauling.\n\nSo you do it the hard way.\n\nYou wedge two fingers under the rebar hook that’s caught your hip cloth and wrench your body sideways until fabric starts to tear. The cloth rips in a long, ugly strip. Pain flares at your hip where the rebar scraped skin through the tear, but the hook lets go.\n\nYour foot is worse. The torn boot is pinned by a bent rebar prong; when you yank, it bites into the raw heel. You clamp your jaw and twist your ankle until the boot peels off with a suctioning *pop*, leaving your sock and bare heel exposed. The rebar rakes you again on the way out—warmth blooms in the water around your foot.\n\nFree—mostly. Bleeding, but free.\n\nA cable bundle brushes your shoulder in the dark: old conduit guts, slick with algae slime, still anchored somewhere above. You grab it with both hands.

The next pulse of light hits that smeared patch and dies instead of blooming into a bright reflection.\n\nYou keep moving without stopping.\n\nAround the bend, the pipe drops a few centimeters and the flow quickens; it tugs at your ankles, trying to pull you deeper. Your tucked, bleeding foot stays out of the current, but the hop-step makes you slower and louder. Your partner grips your belt with both hands now, knuckles white.\n\nBehind you, the hook-pole clacks again—closer than you want. Then a voice, irritated, echoing down the pipe:\n\n“Light’s not carrying—something’s on the corner. Get the chain in. Feel for the bend.”\n\nChain rattles, then a heavier *plunk* as they lower a weighted line into the mouth to drag and “read” the pipe.\n\nOutcome: you successfully used the niche for a brief hide and got around the bend; your smear noticeably reduced the flashlight’s reach past the corner. Consequence: they’ve switched tactics—probing with a weighted chain/line that can snake around the bend and potentially snag you if you don’t open distance fast.",

Then the floor pitches down a touch and the flow accelerates. Your partner nearly goes to a knee; you keep them up by the wrist and belt.\n\nAhead, the pipe finally breaks its monotony: a low, rectangular service throat on the right, half blocked by a bent grille. It’s not a full manway—more like a cable/inspection takeoff—but it’s a hard edge and a change in geometry. Past it, the main pipe continues and you can hear a different sound layered under the water: a hollow, vertical “breathing” draft, like air moving in a shaft.\n\nBehind you, the chain arrives.\n\nNot the weight first—the *feel* of it: a metallic rasping that suddenly becomes loud as it scrapes around the bend. The first links skitter along the pipe bottom, then hop as the weight bumps the corner and swings through. It’s moving fast, dragged from behind with intent.\n\nYour warning lands just in time. Your partner drops flat in panic—too slow by a fraction. The chain slides over their back, but one link catches on their pack strap or belt loop and yanks hard. They make a sharp, involuntary sound.\n\nDown the pipe, a voice barks, immediate and satisfied: “Got something! Haul!”\n\nThe chain goes taut. Your partner is now being pulled backward along the slick pipe floor toward the bend, heels scraping, water spraying.

Your fingers come back slick—part sealant, part blood where the hatch edge bites. The gap widens to maybe two finger-widths along a short run.\n\nConsequence: the hatch still doesn’t lift. The bolts are still doing their job. What you’ve made is a *vent* and a *purchase point*, not an exit.\n\nYour threat down the shaft—“Got a cutter?”—gets an immediate answer, not the one you want.\n\nA voice below, calm and close: “You don’t have a throat to cut from up there.”\n\nThen: a harsh metallic *snip-snip* as someone starts cutting at the cable loop binding the chain. The chain feed resumes, link by link, scraping up concrete. You feel the vibration through the rungs as it climbs.\n\nWorse: they change the hook’s role. Instead of fishing for your ankle, the hook-man starts hammering the pole upward like a battering ram, striking the riser wall and rungs to rattle you loose while the chain comes up to grab.\n\nThreat is now twofold and immediate:\n1) The chain is coming up fast—once they get a loop over a rung or around a leg, they can haul you down or pin you in place.\n2) The hatch seam is open only a couple finger-widths—enough for air and fingers, not enough for a body—and the sharp edge is already cutting you as you work it.",

You get a hairline gap: enough to keep air leaking, not enough to see through.\n\nYou snake your hand up through the crescent opening you’d made earlier—only now it’s mostly gone. Your fingers find the underside of the hatch plate and the bolt ends: smooth, round shanks with very little to grab. These aren’t old hex heads you can spin; they feel like carriage bolts or security bolts—domed on top, with the nut side likely *above* the hatch in whatever clean space is feeding that air.\n\nYou probe, frantic and precise: you do find one thing—wire. A short length of thin steel safety wire or tie, looped through a tab near one bolt, probably meant to keep something from vibrating loose. You can hook it with a finger and pull it taut, but it won’t shear by hand.\n\nBelow, your bark gets an answer—snarled laughter and then a hard, practical repositioning.\n\n“Back off the mouth!” someone shouts. The grinder whine shifts angle, farther down the shaft—safer from the hatch’s drop line. They’re not cutting blind at the seam anymore.\n\nThen the chain changes purpose again: instead of rising, it goes taut and *stops*, braced. A second later the hook-pole slams upward—not at your ankle now, but at the hatch edge itself. They’re trying to rattle your boot out of the seam and force the hatch to sit flush so you lose even that hairline gap and any reach.\n\nYou feel the hatch shudder with each strike. Your boot vibrates against metal; if it slips, the seam closes and your hand is trapped against a domed bolt end with nowhere to withdraw fast.\n\nAnd under all of it—subtle but real—you catch movement off to the side in a flooded culvert slit: a snorkel mask lens glints once, then disappears. Water ripples where someone quietly shifts position.\n\nThreats now:\n- Hook-pole impacts can knock your boot free and slam the hatch shut on your hand.\n- The grinder is repositioning for a safer cut—likely the chain, or the hinge, or something that makes the hatch fail in a way you can’t control.\n- Someone nearby is tracking the situation from cover, close enough to report or intervene.",

Three nights ago, in a half-collapsed valve gallery below the drowned tramline, she found a maintenance hatch that shouldn’t exist: new bolts, fresh sealant, and a stenciled mark that didn’t match any city code. Behind it, a dry pocket with a relay cradle and a spool of catenary wire—too clean, too deliberate. Someone has been working the dead grid.\n\nShe took one thing before she left: a fist-sized ceramic isolator stamped with the upland station’s substation sigil. It’s proof the station is real, and it’s a key to something—load transfer, gate control, maybe the “single clean corridor” people whisper about. It’s also a death sentence if the wrong eyes see it.\n\nBy dawn, the Tidewardens were asking after “the engineer with the drowned plans,” offering air-tank credit and safe passage in exchange for a quiet chat. By dusk, a Choir runner slipped a copper token into Mara’s palm—an invitation to be “verified,” which is their word for interrogated. Meanwhile the Rebar Court posted a salvage writ on her name at the Junction of Nine: return “stolen infrastructure” or forfeit protection rights in all marked corridors.\n\nMara has leverage: she can sell a route, trade a lie, or walk away and let factions bleed each other. But the hatch mark keeps showing up—painted over, scratched out, reappearing closer to inhabited stacks. And that rhythmic banging in the flooded shaft? It’s moved. It’s following her map."

Salt-stale air hangs heavy. Water slaps the stairwell below, then sucks back, dragging grit. Your headlamp beam catches blistered paint and a curtain of dripping cable.\n\nYou kneel on a dry patch of poured concrete and unroll your waterlogged utility sheets on a rusted cable tray. The paper fights you, swollen and soft. You pin corners with bolts from your pocket and mark a new line with a grease pencil: a bypass around a collapsed pump room, measured by count and slope like you’re back in a survey crew. You check ceiling seams for fresh seep and tap a conduit with your wrench—listening for hollow, for hidden voids.\n\nBoots scrape behind you. Three people step into the light: a Tidewarden in a patched dive coat with an air-hose looped over one shoulder; a thin Choir tech with a handheld meter and copper token chain; and a Rebar Court bailiff with a rebar baton and a slate board. They don’t look at each other. They look at your maps.\n\nThe bailiff flips the slate toward you. Your name is chalked under a stamped seal: **SALVAGE WRIT—STOLEN INFRASTRUCTURE**. “Court says you return what you took,” he says, baton resting across his forearm. The Tidewarden cuts in, voice calm. “We can make that go away. Air credit, a dry corridor. You come talk to our captain.” The Choir tech raises the meter; its needle trembles. “No talk,” she says. “Verification. Now. You have something that sings upland.”\n\nThen you see it: on the pillar beside the north tunnel, a fresh stenciled mark—new paint, wrong code—half-hidden under algae smear. And from the flooded shaft below the atrium comes the same rhythmic banging, closer than yesterday, steady as a pump that won’t prime.\n\nAll three wait, blocking three exits. Your maps are open, your pack is at your feet, and the ceramic isolator is a hard weight against your ribs. You have seconds to choose who you face—and whether you move before the banging reaches the stairs."

Concrete sweats; paint blisters in pale curls; cable bundles hang like drowned vines, dripping black. Far off, something bangs in a flooded shaft—rhythmic, patient—answered by the thin whine of wind through cracked conduit. Every step is a choice between slick silt and jagged aggregate; boots find purchase, then lose it. Light is rationed here: flashlight beams die in mist, leaving only the taste of rust and the pressure of dark.",
      "Salt-caked survivors cluster under three banners. The **Tidewardens** present as rescue divers and levee-keepers, hauling the stranded from flooded stacks and rationing air-tanks; secretly they sabotage pumps and gates to keep the outskirts dependent and their toll-corridors profitable. The **Catenary Choir** pose as calm technicians “listening” to the grid’s last hum, blessing safe routes with meter-readings; in truth they hoard relays and hunt the upland station to monopolize power and enforce obedience by blackout. The **Rebar Court** claims to arbitrate disputes and salvage rights with blunt law; behind it, they run a protection racket and sell maps to both sides. Tidewardens drown Choir probes; Choir bribes the Court; the Court plays them into open violence.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"factions\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Tidewardens\",\n      \"public_front\": \"Rescue divers and levee-keepers who ration air, mark safe passages, and evacuate the stranded.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Sabotage pumps and control gates to keep districts flooded and dependent, extracting tolls and tribute for access to 'dry' corridors.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Catenary Choir\",\n      \"public_front\": \"Technicians and route-guides who use meters and old procedures to 'read' the grid and certify safe tunnels.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Hoard relays and pursue the upland grid station to monopolize power, using selective blackouts to force compliance.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Rebar Court\",\n      \"public_front\": \"A rough civic tribunal that settles salvage claims, mediates disputes, and maintains order around key junctions.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Protection racket and information brokerage—selling maps, adjudications, and access to whichever side pays more.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

      "Mara Kestrel’s maps aren’t just old municipal sheets—they’re *recently amended*. Three nights ago, in a half-collapsed valve gallery below the drowned tramline, she found a maintenance hatch that shouldn’t exist: new bolts, fresh sealant, and a stenciled mark that didn’t match any city code. Behind it, a dry pocket with a relay cradle and a spool of catenary wire—too clean, too deliberate. Someone has been working the dead grid.\n\nShe took one thing before she left: a fist-sized ceramic isolator stamped with the upland station’s substation sigil. It’s proof the station is real, and it’s a key to something—load transfer, gate control, maybe the “single clean corridor” people whisper about. It’s also a death sentence if the wrong eyes see it.\n\nBy dawn, the Tidewardens were asking after “the engineer with the drowned plans,” offering air-tank credit and safe passage in exchange for a quiet chat. By dusk, a Choir runner slipped a copper token into Mara’s palm—an invitation to be “verified,” which is their word for interrogated. Meanwhile the Rebar Court posted a salvage writ on her name at the Junction of Nine: return “stolen infrastructure” or forfeit protection rights in all marked corridors.\n\nMara has leverage: she can sell a route, trade a lie, or walk away and let factions bleed each other. But the hatch mark keeps showing up—painted over, scratched out, reappearing closer to inhabited stacks. And that rhythmic banging in the flooded shaft? It’s moved. It’s following her map."

        "content": "Morning, low tide, at the **Junction of Nine**—a ring of half-submerged service platforms where four maintenance corridors meet under a cracked transit atrium. Salt-stale air hangs heavy. Water slaps the stairwell below, then sucks back, dragging grit. Your headlamp beam catches blistered paint and a curtain of dripping cable.\n\nYou kneel on a dry patch of poured concrete and unroll your waterlogged utility sheets on a rusted cable tray. The paper fights you, swollen and soft. You pin corners with bolts from your pocket and mark a new line with a grease pencil: a bypass around a collapsed pump room, measured by count and slope like you’re back in a survey crew. You check ceiling seams for fresh seep and tap a conduit with your wrench—listening for hollow, for hidden voids.\n\nBoots scrape behind you. Three people step into the light: a Tidewarden in a patched dive coat with an air-hose looped over one shoulder; a thin Choir tech with a handheld meter and copper token chain; and a Rebar Court bailiff with a rebar baton and a slate board. They don’t look at each other. They look at your maps.\n\nThe bailiff flips the slate toward you. Your name is chalked under a stamped seal: **SALVAGE WRIT—STOLEN INFRASTRUCTURE**. “Court says you return what you took,” he says, baton resting across his forearm. The Tidewarden cuts in, voice calm. “We can make that go away. Air credit, a dry corridor. You come talk to our captain.” The Choir tech raises the meter; its needle trembles. “No talk,” she says. “Verification. Now. You have something that sings upland.”\n\nThen you see it: on the pillar beside the north tunnel, a fresh stenciled mark—new paint, wrong code—half-hidden under algae smear. And from the flooded shaft below the atrium comes the same rhythmic banging, closer than yesterday, steady as a pump that won’t prime.\n\nAll three wait, blocking three exits. Your maps are open, your pack is at your feet, and the ceramic isolator is a hard weight against your ribs. You have seconds to choose who you face—and whether you move before the banging reaches the stairs."

        "content": "Your maps slap together wetly as you snap them up; the paper nearly tears at a fold, but you get it bundled and jammed under your coat. The pack strap catches, then slides onto your shoulder with a jolt that knocks your headlamp beam sideways across the pillar.\n\n“Move,” you bark.\n\nThe bailiff reads the feint as compliance for half a heartbeat—his baton dips—then you cut hard. His eyes widen and he lunges, rebar baton swinging low for your shin. It clips your boot instead of bone, sparks off a metal edge, and you stumble but keep your feet.\n\nThe Tidewarden reacts faster than the others: he steps across the north tunnel mouth, blocking it with his shoulder and the looped air-hose like a garrote. “No,” he says, flat. He grabs for your coat front.\n\nYou slam into him at speed. Your shoulder drives him back a step onto slick silt; his boots skid. The Choir tech doesn’t chase—she raises her meter and snaps two short words that sound like procedure, not a prayer. The needle pegs, and your headlamp flickers once, then steadies—like something just drank a bite of current nearby.\n\nYour beam catches the fresh stencil in full as you pass it: the same wrong-code mark, painted over old flake, still glossy at the edges. Under it, someone has scratched a tiny arrow pointing deeper into the north tunnel.\n\nBehind you, the bailiff shouts, “Writ in force! Stop her!” He’s coming, heavy-footed. The Tidewarden, off-balance, recovers and reaches again—fingers snagging your pack strap. The strap bites into his hand; he yanks, trying to pull you back into the atrium.\n\nThen the banging changes: not below anymore. It answers from inside the north tunnel—two impacts, a pause, two impacts—close enough you feel it through the concrete.\n\nAhead, the north corridor is half-lit by your lamp: a maintenance run with hanging cable bundles and a shallow sheet of water over the floor. Fifty feet in, something pale breaks the surface and slides back under—fast, deliberate—leaving a V-wake through scum.\n\nYou are not clear yet. The Tidewarden has your strap, the bailiff is closing, and whatever is making that rhythm is now in the tunnel with you."

The webbing parts with a dry snap.\n\nThe pack drops straight into the Tidewarden’s hands and then into the sheet water with a heavy slap. He grunts—more surprised than hurt—then immediately clamps both hands on it like it’s evidence. “Fine,” he spits, and you hear the hose on his shoulder clack as he turns back toward the atrium, already calling, “She ditched her load—north tunnel!”\n\nYou sprint. The shallow water tries to steal your boots with every step, but you hit the wall and jump, fingers catching a corroded cable tray support and a rung of an old side-ladder bolted into the concrete. Rust flakes into your palms. The first rung flexes; it holds.\n\nYou haul yourself up and start moving sideways and forward along the ladder line, boots scraping for purchase on narrow brackets just above the waterline. Below you, something moves again—pale, quick—tracking the line of your shadow more than your body. It bumps the wall once, hard, and the vibration shivers up the ladder into your arms.\n\nBehind, the bailiff enters the tunnel mouth and stops short when he sees you climb. “Get down!” he barks, baton raised like it can reach you. He won’t wade in fast; he keeps to the dry edge, scanning.\n\nAhead, you follow the scratched arrow. Twenty feet deeper, it points to a service recess: a metal access panel half-hidden behind hanging cable bundles. The panel’s bolts are newer than everything around it—clean heads, bright edges. Someone has been here recently.\n\nThe rhythmic banging is right under that recess now, from inside the wall or the flooded cavity behind it: two hits, pause, two hits—patient and close.\n\nAs you reach the recess, the ladder section you’re on gives a sharp creak. One of the brackets has pulled a few millimeters out of the concrete, leaving a fresh crescent of crumbling aggregate. If you keep your full weight on it much longer, it’s going to tear free.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_remove\":[\"pack (with any contents)\"],\"inventory_add\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Junction of Nine - North Tunnel\"],\"npcs_add\":[\"Tidewarden diver (unnamed)\",\"Rebar Court bailiff (unnamed)\",\"Catenary Choir tech (unnamed)\"]}\n```"

Your hands fist a bundle of hanging cables—rubber slick with condensation—and you swing into the recess. Your boots find a narrow dry lip: a raised concrete curb inside the alcove. It holds. The ladder behind you gives a final protesting groan but doesn’t tear out—not yet.\n\n“Bailiff—stay out of the water unless you want it on you,” you snap.\n\nThe bailiff halts at the edge, eyes flicking to the water where the pale shape just traced another fast line under the scum. He swallows, then tries to save face by lifting his baton toward you like a gavel. “You’re under writ,” he says, but he doesn’t step in.\n\nYou get your wrench on the first new bolt. The head is clean, not rounded—whoever set it wanted it removable. Fast and sloppy works for the first two: they squeal and come free, dropping into the recess with sharp pings.\n\nOn the third, your wrench slips—your hand is wet, the rubber cable jacket smears against your palm—and you skin your knuckles on the panel edge. Blood beads immediately in the cold air.\n\nThe banging stops.\n\nFor a half-second there’s only the drip of cable and your breathing—then something hits the access panel from behind, hard. The metal bows outward with a dull *thoom* and rebounds. Dust puffs from the seam. The remaining bolts jump in their holes.\n\nBelow your boots, in the waterline at the recess mouth, the pale thing surfaces long enough for you to see it: not a fish. A forearm—human, swollen and bleached—ending in a hand that shouldn’t still have grip. It hooks fingers into the recess’s lower edge and pulls, steady and purposeful, as if it heard the bolt squeal and homed in on it.\n\nBehind you, from the tunnel mouth, the Tidewarden’s voice carries closer now, urgent. “Don’t open anything! Kestrel—step away from the panel!”\n\nThe bailiff takes one involuntary step back from the water, baton up, and says quieter, “What the hell is that?”\n\nThe access panel bulges again—two impacts, pause, two impacts—now coming from directly behind it, like something is testing the last fasteners. Your next wrench-turn will either open it… or leave you in a recess with a climbing hand at your feet and whatever’s inside the wall trying to get out."

He raises the baton like he’s about to answer—then the water near the recess dimples and slides, and he chooses distance instead. “Court doesn’t cover… *that*,” he mutters, backing toward the tunnel mouth without taking his eyes off the surface.\n\nYou shove off the recess lip and catch the wall supports again, moving fast. The bracket line shudders under your weight; rust flakes rain into the water. You keep your boots off the surface, skimming along narrow metal tabs and ladder rungs.\n\nBehind you, the access panel gives a long, ugly groan—metal flexing. A seam opens a finger-width with a sound like tearing foil. Something inside exhales a breath of warmer air that fogs the recess for an instant.\n\nThen the water answers: a sudden surge straight up at the recess mouth. The pale arm comes out higher than before, not grabbing blindly—reaching for the supports you’re using. Fingers rake the wall, miss your heel by inches, and slap back into the water with a loud smack.\n\nAhead, past the arrow, the wall supports continue—but the next section is partially collapsed: two rungs are missing, leaving a gap over the water about the length of your body. Beyond the gap, the tunnel bends left into darker conduit haze.\n\nFrom behind, the Tidewarden is closer now, boots splashing at the edge where the water is thinnest. He shouts, “Mara! Don’t—” and then cuts off as the water near him ripples in a straight line, moving away from the recess and toward the tunnel mouth like something is redirecting.\n\nThe threat is immediate and specific now: the thing in the water is learning your route along the wall, and you’ve got a rung-gap coming up that will force a jump or a drop—right as the surface starts to move toward the people behind you."

You kick once against the wall, get a boot on a narrow tab, and haul your weight up without breaking the surface.\n\nYour headlamp beam, kept low, skates over the waterline. You catch a pale streak just under the film, pacing you—too smooth to be floating drift.\n\n“Back up, Tidewarden—it’s tracking movement on the wall!” you shout.\n\nThe Tidewarden, now visible at the edge behind the bailiff, hesitates mid-step. He lifts his hands as if to steady himself, then actually does back up two paces onto higher rubble. “Bull,” he calls, but his voice cracks on the last word. He’s watching the water, not you.\n\nThe bailiff uses the moment to retreat another step, baton lowered. “You hear her,” he snaps at the diver, then, softer, “Don’t be stupid.”\n\nYou keep moving into the left bend. The air changes immediately—less open tunnel, more enclosed conduit. The wall supports continue but are slicker here, coated in algae smear where the mist never dries. Your lamp reveals drag marks on the concrete at shoulder height, as if something heavy has been hauled along the wall recently.\n\nBehind you, metal shrieks: the access panel finally gives way. It doesn’t explode outward; it peels open with a slow, wrenching tear and then *clangs* against something inside. A breath of dry, warm air rolls down the tunnel—cleaner than it should be.\n\nThe water reacts as if a current turned on. The surface pulls toward the bend you’re entering, tugging floating grit with it in a thin, steady stream. The pale shape follows that pull, accelerating.\n\nThen the grab comes—not from below your feet, but from the wall itself ahead: a hand shoots out of a fist-sized maintenance hole at knee height, fingers snapping for your boot as you pass. It misses by a hair and scrapes rust off the bracket with a shrill *skrrt*.\n\nWhatever is in here isn’t just in the water anymore.

You’re now a full rung-and-a-half higher than before, boots planted on a narrow crosspiece, shoulders near the ceiling line.\n\nYour headlamp swings ahead and catches a side niche: an old valve recess cut into the wall about six meters forward, half-height, with a corroded wheel and a steel access door hanging slightly ajar on one hinge. It’s not sealed; it’s a place to duck, not a bunker.\n\nThe water below you is moving with intent now—streaming toward the bend. The pale thing breaks the surface briefly, not fully emerging: just enough to show a slack jaw and one eye filmed over, then it submerges again and slides along the wall under your supports as if following the fastest line.\n\nBehind you, the torn access panel clatters again. Something bumps it from the other side, testing the opening. Warm air continues to breathe out in pulses, like a vent line cycling.\n\nThe Tidewarden’s voice echoes from back down the tunnel, farther now—he really did retreat. “Kestrel! Get out of there—Court won’t pay your lungs back!”\n\nAs you shift your weight to move toward the valve niche, the rung you’re on gives a sharp *ping*. One of its anchor points has started to pull from the concrete—freshly stressed by your climb.

Half of it is intact and dry; the far section dips where a stanchion has sheared, the grating twisted down toward the water. Above the catwalk is a junction box alcove: a recessed cabinet with its door missing, exposing ceramic insulators and a bundle of blackened conductors. The hum you heard is coming from there—faint, steady, and wrong for a dead district.\n\nIn that same flash you also catch the hanging “cable” you clipped: it isn’t loose utility line. It’s a looped length of catenary wire with a ceramic isolator tied in-line—cleaner than the rest, recently handled. It’s been hung deliberately at shin height like a snare.\n\nYou reach up and yank it aside.\n\nThe wire doesn’t give like slack line; it bites back. It snaps taut and the ceramic isolator swings up and smacks the bracket near your head with a sharp *clack*. The loop whips across your forearm, scraping hard—then the whole rig jerks toward the junction alcove as if it’s tethered there. Something in the box clicks once, like a relay engaging.\n\nThe hum rises a notch.\n\nBelow you, the water surges again—this time not just a wave. A shoulder or back breaks the surface under the catwalk section, sliding fast. It’s using the wall and your supports like a guide rail, keeping pace with your movement.\n\nYou don’t wait. You hook an elbow over the nearest catwalk stanchion and haul yourself up off the failing brackets. The grating is cold and gritty under your boots—dry enough to trust for now.

Your hands close on the first pair and you rip.\n\nThe hum doesn’t die. It *jumps*—a higher pitch—and the cable in your grip kicks like a live animal. A white-blue snap pops at the lug and heat bites your palm. The smell of ozone and burnt rubber blooms instantly.\n\nYou wrench again, harder, and the second pull tears a conductor free. This time the hum stutters, drops for half a second… then comes back lower, steadier.

He’s not leaving; he’s repositioning.\n\nYou keep moving.\n\nThe intact catwalk runs straight for another ten meters before it doglegs left around a support pier. Your headlamp stays low, beam scraping the grating and the base of the wall-run. The humming line is clearly visible now: a bundled conduit strapped to the concrete with fresh metal bands—newer than anything else here. Every few meters a ceramic standoff insulator keeps it off the wall.\n\nAhead, you find three things in quick succession:\n\n1) **A ladder up**: bolted rungs disappearing into a ceiling hatch. The hatch is shut, and there’s a **fresh smear of sealant** around its rim—recent, not cracked. Someone has been through and tried to keep it dry.\n\n2) **A painted mark** on the pier at the dogleg: the same stenciled symbol you’ve been seeing—partly scrubbed, then repainted over.\n\n3) **Another snare**: a thin, dark line stretched at ankle height across the catwalk just before the dogleg. It’s not catenary wire this time—looks like braided cord or stripped cable jacket, tied off to the conduit bands on the humming wall-run. If you’d kept your pace, you’d have hit it.\n\nBelow you, the pale shape tracks your movement. It stays just under the surface, parallel to the catwalk, and when you reach the dogleg it *bumps* the underside of the grating directly beneath the snare—testing, like it knows where you are.\n\nFrom behind, the Tidewarden calls again, closer than he should be if he was “backing out.” He’s moved to a new angle. “Engineer! Don’t climb. That hatch is Court-sealed in this sector. You go up there, you’ll have every bailiff in Nine on you.”\n\nThe tapping you heard earlier answers from inside the pier at your left—right behind the painted mark—slow and deliberate now, like knuckles on the other side of a door."

The conduit bands along the wall-run shiver, and the ceramic standoffs give a tiny *tick… tick…* as they flex. Whatever this line is feeding, it just noticed you.\n\nBelow, your headlamp angled down catches movement: the pale shape in the water slides to the base of the ladder well and rises until it presses against the underside of the catwalk. You see a long, smooth back break the surface for a second—no eyes, no clear mouth—just a wet ridge and a sudden *thump* as it rams the grating once, hard, directly under your feet.\n\nThe ladder vibrates.

OFF!”\n\nAt the dogleg pier, right beside the painted mark, the tapping becomes a sharp, fast *RAP-RAP-RAP* from inside the concrete.

Then open something useful.”\n\nFor a beat there’s only the wall-hum and the Tidewarden’s strained breathing—then the voice in the box answers, still calm. “Useful is relative. Don’t touch the load path.”\n\nYou lean in just enough to sweep your lamp into the service void.\n\nThe beam shows a crawlspace continuation—tight, rectangular, maybe shoulder-width—running left for a few meters before it kinks downward. There’s a proper handhold rail riveted along the inner lip, and a quick-release latch on a second inner panel… but it’s been wired shut with fresh catenary tie and a wax seal stamped with the upland substation sigil. Whoever did this expected someone like you to look.\n\nYour lamp also catches the relay cradle: ceramic standoffs, a neat coil of new wire, and a small microphone puck. That green LED is steady, not blinking—live and listening.\n\nYou shout to the Tidewarden to fall back to the dogleg.\n\nHe tries. He unhooks the harpoon rig from the ladder frame and starts shuffling backward along the catwalk, line still tight. “Dogleg—NOW!” he yells, but the movement gives the thing in the water slack.\n\nIt uses it.\n\nA pale arm—too long, jointed wrong—hooks up through the grating at the stanchion he just left. Fingers like wet cable ties clamp around the vertical support and *pull*. The stanchion buckles with a metallic groan. The catwalk section between you and the dogleg dips a full handspan, bolts popping one after another like knuckles.\n\nThe Tidewarden stumbles, catches the rail, and drags himself onto the more stable dogleg platform, but the harpoon line whips loose and slaps the water—no longer keeping the thing off the ladder or anything else.\n\nThe voice in the wall speaks again, closer in your ear through the tiny speaker: “If that span drops, you don’t get a second chance. Get into the void, Mara. Or step away and lose it.”\n\nThe catwalk under you is still holding—barely—but the sag is increasing, and the next stanchion is already creaking."

It breaks in gritty chunks, the stamped sigil splitting cleanly down the middle.\n\nThe moment the seal breaks, the green LED on the relay cradle flickers—steady to blinking—like it just acknowledged a state change.\n\n“Fine—your void it is. If you fry me, I haunt your substation.”\n\nFrom the speaker: a quiet exhale, then, “Don’t be dramatic. Go.”\n\nYou shoulder the inner panel. It gives way with a metallic bark and a burst of dry dust. You dive into the crawlspace, maps pressed to your chest. The edges scrape concrete; the space is tight enough that your packless shoulders still wedge. Your lamp beam stutters as it bumps the wall, then steadies, painting the crawlspace in a harsh cone.\n\nBehind you, the catwalk span finally lets go—*not* the whole thing, but a section. A row of bolts shears and the grating drops with a shriek, slamming into the water and throwing up a cold spray that hits your boots and calves as you pull in. The sound is immediate: water slapping through the new hole, metal chattering against metal.\n\nThe Tidewarden, on the dogleg, does exactly what you told him—he doesn’t follow. He backs farther onto the platform, raises his lamp, and shouts over the noise, “Kestrel! I’m holding here!”\n\nSomething pale surges beneath the fallen grating and *rakes* at it from below. The metal flexes and clatters like teeth.\n\nInside the crawlspace, the air is dry but sharp with ozone. A thin cable runs along the right wall into the kink ahead. As you wriggle forward, your lamp catches fresh chalk hash-marks on the concrete—recent, neat, technician-straight.\n\nFrom the speaker behind you, now muffled by the panel and distance: “Don’t turn around. Keep moving. There’s a drop in three meters—feet first. If you go headfirst, you’ll break your neck.”\n\nNo shocks hit you.

Your lamp is angled down; the beam finds the landing before your soles do.\n\nIt’s a vertical service shaft, about two meters down. Dry. The floor is a grated platform over a deeper void, with a narrow ledge of poured concrete on the left wall—enough to stand on if you keep your weight close. The cable you’ve been following continues down through a conduit throat and disappears below the grating.\n\nYou ease down fast. Your boots touch the grating and it flexes—old steel, but not failing. When you shift your weight onto it, it holds.\n\nYour lamp catches two important details immediately:\n\n1) **Side access**: on the left wall, shoulder height, there’s a rectangular hatch with a recessed handle. It’s been opened recently—scrape marks around the handle, and the hinge pins are shiny.\n\n2) **A threat**: on the far side of the shaft, opposite the hatch, there’s a small motion sensor puck and a pinhole camera set into a newer plate. A red indicator blinks once as your light sweeps it, then goes steady.\n\nThe calm voice comes again, now clearer, as if the speaker is in this shaft too: “Good. Stay off the center of the grate. Third bar from the left is cracked.”\n\nAs if to underline it, something below the grating **hits the underside**—not the pale thing from the water (this is dry), but a heavy, rhythmic *thunk* from deeper in the shaft. Dust puffs up through the grate. The impact is patient, repeated, like someone testing the same spot.\n\nFrom behind you—muffled and more distant now—the Tidewarden is still making noise, but his banging has changed pace: faster, panicked. “Kestrel—IT’S CLIMBING—” His words cut off into a wet scramble and a sharp metallic crash.\n\nThen he’s loud again, forced loud: “Still here!

But it’s not an exit. It’s a loop to the valve gallery.”\n\nYou hear a quick *tap-tap* from somewhere ahead—like a knuckle on tile—then a whisper, not from the speaker, from the darkness to the right: “Mara?”\n\nThe cough wasn’t accidental. Whoever’s there knows your name.\n\nThe speaker continues, lower: “There’s a left crawl thirty paces ahead, opposite the right bend.

Choir.” A pause. “I want the ceramic.

You yank.\n\nNothing—then it gives a centimeter with a gritty squeal you can’t fully smother. The panel is heavier than it should be, and it’s stuck on swollen guides. You brace and haul again. It opens enough to slip your head and one shoulder into a narrow utility alcove: a service drop with a ladder down into black.\n\nYou don’t climb so much as fall onto the first rungs and slide down fast, palms burning. Above, you drag the panel toward closed; it doesn’t seat flush, but it narrows to a finger gap. From the corridor, it’ll look like a misaligned access, not an open hole.\n\nYou hear the respirator runner hit the bend and overshoot by momentum—boot slaps, a sharp intake. His light sweeps, catches the skewed edge of the access panel for a blink, then swings away.\n\nHe hisses, close, “Kestrel! Junction’s ahead—don’t—”\n\nSable’s voice, farther back, hard: “She’s not going open. Check the wall. Check the wall!”\n\nThe runner doubles back two steps. His beam crawls along the concrete and lands on the panel gap. He steps in, pry bar tapping once—*tink*—right above your head through the metal.\n\nYou freeze on the ladder, one rung down from the alcove floor, the shaft air damp and cold. Below you, water is moving—quiet but present—lapping against something metal, like a flooded landing. The same siphon-glug you heard in the trench is down here too, faint but steady, as if this drop ties into the run that just started filling.\n\nAbove, the runner wedges the pry bar into the panel seam. Metal groans. The gap widens a fraction.\n\nSable arrives at the bend; you hear her limp in the cadence. “Open it,” she says. “If she went down, she’s boxed. These drops dead-end or flood.”\n\nThe pry bar bites again.

It tears free with a gritty snap. You fling it out into the dark; it clatters across metal grating and bounces—*clang… clang… clang*—then settles with a final hollow *donk* deeper in the shaft.\n\n“Yeah—dead end,” you call up, breath tight.\n\nFor half a second there’s nothing—then the pry bar above stops working the panel.\n\nSable’s voice carries down, closer now, sharp with certainty: “She’s lying.”\n\nThe respirator runner answers, “I heard her—she’s down there.”\n\n“Then don’t look down like an idiot,” Sable snaps. “Drop a light. If she runs, she runs into water.”\n\nA moment later something small scrapes over the lip above, and a light source drops: not a flashlight—too valuable—but a chemical glowstick. It bounces off a rung, hits the water with a *plop*, and floats, casting a sick green wash across the landing.\n\nThe glow outlines you didn’t see in the dark: the landing is a grated platform bolted to the wall, with an open rectangular sump cut into it on the far side. Water is actively draining into that sump in a steady whirl, the *glug* you heard now loud and constant. Whatever started siphoning is pulling from here too.\n\nIn the green light you feel along the wall: you find a low, square hatch at knee height, its edges sealed long ago—until recently. Fresh gray sealant has been cut and peeled back in a rough crescent, leaving a gap you can get fingers into. The hatch is warm compared to the water, like there’s air moving behind it.\n\nAbove you, boots scrape; someone starts down the ladder. The rungs creak in a steady rhythm—controlled descent, one hand free.\n\nSable stays up top, voice angled down: “Don’t go far.

You hear his boots splash, then the grate creak as he shifts weight. You sweep your foot through the water on your side of the hatch opening—one hard kick—sending a sheet toward the sump. It answers with a louder *glug* and a brief increase in draining noise, enough to smear the small sounds you make as you move.\n\nThe climber mutters, close and muffled through rubber and mask, “Landing. Glow’s here.” His pry bar taps the grate once. “No visual.”\n\nSable’s voice drops down from above, calmer now: “Check the walls. Feel for warm air. She’ll take a cut.”\n\nThe conduit run you’re in is just tall enough to crouch-walk. Bundles of cable are clipped along the right side like ribs; your shoulder brushes them and they tremble faintly.

The hatch—your hatch—scrapes. The climber has found it and is working it from the other side.\n\nHe calls out, low but urgent, “Found a cut hatch. Warm draft.”\n\nSable answers immediately, “Hold.

You reach a section where the conduit widens into a small service bay with a waist-high rail and a square opening in the floor—an access down. The air is definitely favoring that opening: warmer draft rising, carrying a sharper ozone bite and a whiff of hot insulation.\n\nAt the edge of the opening, the source of the banging reveals itself in the faintest ambient bleed from behind you: a vertical pipe disappears into the hole, and something below is striking it with steady force—metal on metal, not random debris.

You don’t know what you just tied into!”\n\nThen, from deeper in the corridor, a second sound answers the hum: a slow, deliberate *tap… tap… tap* on metal, approaching from the dark ahead—rhythmic, patient, and close enough that it’s already in this corridor system.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Upland feeder corridor (amber-lit, live hum)\"],\"npcs_add\":[]}```"

The latch gives with a harsh snap; the door swings inward on one hinge, scraping concrete.

In the dim, you can see their pupils wide behind the scratched faceplate.

Something *taps* the metal door from the other side, not a human test: a light, repeated pecking right along the seam you forced.\n\nThen a voice, farther down the corridor outside, calls: “It’s moving—hear it? In the wall.”\n\nAnother answers: “Listener’s got it. Don’t open. Find the next access and cut it off.”\n\nYou reach the cable bundle: thick, old catenary and feeders wrapped in cracked rubber, cinched with corroded straps. The side throat is a rectangular bite out of the wall, just big enough to worm through. Cold air leaks from it, and with it the smell of stagnant water.\n\nAs you push into the throat, your shoulder brushes the bundle. The insulation is heat-soft in places from the live run above; it gives under pressure. A faint static hiss rises.\n\nThe shielded figure catches it too and hisses, panicked, “Don’t—don’t press it—”\n\nToo late to undo the contact: a tiny blue spark snaps somewhere in the bundle, bright as a pinprick, and the handhole behind you answers with a sharp *clack*—a relay reacting to the fault.\n\nImmediately, outside, boots start moving again—fast. Someone shouts, “There! It tripped—second panel, downline!”\n\nYou’re in the side throat now, both of you, shoulders scraping. Ahead, the passage opens into a larger void: you can hear it—space and water—an echoing drip and the low lap of a half-flooded chamber.

You do the same on the chamber edge where the water’s shallowest, forcing your breathing quiet.\n\nThey find it—fast. A rusted ladder ring set is bolted into the wall under a square ceiling hatch.

Your torn sleeve flaps, and your palm leaves intermittent red smears on the concrete when you plant it wrong.\n\nAhead, the rushing sound resolves into a real change in grade: the culvert drops into a vertical spill a body-length wide. Water sheets over the lip into darkness. The shielded figure has reached it and is bracing, legs splayed, one hand on the wall—hesitating, listening to you and the pursuit behind.\n\nBehind you, the crawler is in the duct now, coming fast—its scraping is steady and closing, and the line behind it hisses as it feeds."

Cold water slaps your face as you fall through the spill-sheet, and you twist mid-drop, hunting for the crawler’s line with your heel.\n\nYour boot catches it.\n\nNot cleanly—more a hook-and-drag. The feed-line snaps tight across the edge above with a high, vibrating *twang*. For a split second you’re yanked sideways in midair, enough to wrench your hip and flare the scrape where the rebar got you. Then the line bites into something sharp at the lip—broken aggregate or a rusted bracket—and starts sawing.\n\nYou hit the plunge pool hard, feet first, knees buckling. Water closes over your head. Your torn sleeve balloons; your bleeding palm stings like fire in the churn.\n\nThe shielded figure is there, already fighting up, their harness strap in your hand. You both surface in a cramped, roaring sump: a round shaft chamber with a waist-deep boil and a low outlet tunnel that’s half-submerged, sucking water through with a constant pull.\n\nAbove, the line screams again—then *pops*.\n\nSomething drops after you: the crawler, or part of it, tumbling end-over-end. It hits the water like a brick, splashes once, then immediately gets taken by the outlet’s suction. You see a brief glint—plastic housing, a stubby lamp—before it vanishes into the half-drowned tunnel with a clattering scrape.\n\nFrom the spill above, a voice echoes down, suddenly sharp with anger: “Line’s cut! She dropped the damn crawler!”\n\nA second voice, farther back: “Get a light down there—NOW. Don’t go in blind.”\n\nThe shielded figure coughs, visor dripping, and tries to move toward the outlet—then freezes as the current tugs at their legs. The suction is strong enough to pull you off-balance if you step wrong; the outlet is your only way forward, but it’s actively trying to drag anything loose into it.\n\nAnd somewhere in that outlet tunnel, the crawler is still scraping—alive or jammed, you can’t tell—making a hard, intermittent *tick…tick…tick* as it’s pushed along ahead of you by the flow."

The current grabs at your hips and tries to spin you, but the wall gives you friction—enough to inch forward instead of getting swept.\n\nYour boots find the lip: a narrow ledge on the left, just under the surface. You plant a heel on it and use it like a rung, pushing you both into the throat of the tunnel. The waterline drops from waist-deep boil to a fast, knee-to-thigh-deep sluice. You’re moving now, crouch-crawling, half-swimming.\n\nBehind you, above the spill, light blooms—someone finally points a lamp down. The shaft brightens in a cone, but you’re already around the first shallow dogleg of the outlet. The light skates across the water and dies against the curve, leaving you in gray-dark again.\n\nUp above, the angry voice carries, distorted by the falling water: “I saw ’em—into the outlet! Don’t let ’em—”\n\nThen the sound changes: boots on concrete at the lip, a quick argument, and the unmistakable clatter of someone preparing to descend without committing to the drop.\n\nIn the outlet ahead, the crawler’s *tick…tick…tick* becomes louder—then stops abruptly with a hollow *thunk*. Something has jammed it.\n\nYou reach the obstruction within seconds: the tunnel narrows slightly where a partial collapse has left a jagged rib of concrete and rebar protruding into the flow. The crawler’s plastic body is wedged there, lamp still on, its beam shining straight back at you through the water like a low headlight. The current piles against it, making a louder, higher-pressure rush. It’s acting like a strainer—anything loose (cloth, straps, fingers) wants to get pulled into the gap around it.\n\nThe shielded figure flinches from the glare and tries to pull their head away, which yanks your tether arm. You both wobble; your scraped hip bangs the wall.\n\nAbove and behind, the shaft light intensifies again and a new sound joins it: a line paying out fast, hissing—someone has thrown a rope or feed-cable down and is about to follow the route you took, using the wall to avoid the drop.\n\nYou have forward progress, but the jammed crawler is now a hard choke point: to get past, you’ll have to either clear it or squeeze around it while the current tries to pin you to it—and the people behind are setting up to enter the outlet within moments."

It’s tight enough that their tank/pack (whatever’s under that shielded rig) scrapes concrete with a squeal. The current tries to suck the loose harness tail toward the strainer gap, but your hand clamps it short and you physically pin their strap against their back as you push.\n\nThey make it past.\n\nYou follow, sliding your hip and shoulder along the wall for friction. Your torn sleeve catches a rebar whisker and rips again, but you keep moving. For a second your boot slips off the submerged ledge and the current yanks your shin toward the crawler—hard enough that your knee bangs the housing with a dull *clack*—then you recover and get your weight back onto the wall.\n\nNow you’re downstream of it.\n\nYou plant your boot on the crawler’s casing and kick.\n\nThe first kick just flexes it in the jam. The second kick bites: you feel the housing shift, and a hidden rebar tooth that was pinning it snaps free with a metallic *ping*. The crawler lurches, rotates, and the current takes it immediately—yanking it out of the choke and shooting it downstream past your legs.\n\nIt doesn’t just “clear the choke.” It clears it violently.\n\nA sudden surge of backed-up water slams through the gap you just threaded. The shielded figure gets clipped in the calves and almost faceplants; your grip on their harness keeps them from being swept fully off the wall, but you both get dragged a half-meter forward on your knees.\n\nUpstream, around the bend, you hear the rope team hit the change in flow.\n\nA voice barks, sharp and close now: “—current just changed! Something moved!”\n\nAnother answers, strained, as if bracing on the wall: “Hold the line—HOLD—”\n\nThen a wet slap and a grunt as someone loses footing briefly and catches themselves. They’re in the outlet, but the sudden surge has made their entry messier and slower.\n\nDownstream, the crawler clatters away ahead of you, lamp still on, bouncing off the tunnel floor and walls—its light now a moving beacon that will guide anyone chasing you through the bends unless it dies or gets buried.\n\nThe immediate threat is clear: you bought seconds by disrupting the rope team’s footing, but you also sent a bright, obvious marker ahead into your only route forward."

Their hands claw at your forearm and harness strap, not to fight you, but to find “up” that isn’t there.\n\nYou kick hard anyway, using your hips as a wedge to keep them from rolling. Something hard—rebar stump or broken aggregate—rakes your shin as you pass, tearing fabric and skin.

You lift your chest just enough to slide forward without scraping.\n\nYour partner follows—and their scorched elbow betrays them. The fabric is stiff and catches the lowest line. You feel it through the harness: a tiny *tick* transmitted up the wire, too light to be a full snag but enough to pluck it.\n\nThe recessed wall box answers immediately.\n\nA sharp internal *click*, then a thin tone—barely audible, like a mosquito whine—starts pulsing in the conduit. Not loud, but unmistakably intentional. The copper X’s don’t move; nothing “springs.” This isn’t a snare meant to trip you physically. It’s an alarm and a locator.\n\nFrom behind, muffled through the bend, you hear the leader outside the entrance snap to it: “There—hear that? She’s on the instrumented run. Keep the dry line moving.

The undertow doesn’t care about the mistake; it keeps hauling.\n\nSo you do it the hard way.\n\nYou wedge two fingers under the rebar hook that’s caught your hip cloth and wrench your body sideways until fabric starts to tear. The cloth rips in a long, ugly strip. Pain flares at your hip where the rebar scraped skin through the tear, but the hook lets go.\n\nYour foot is worse. The torn boot is pinned by a bent rebar prong; when you yank, it bites into the raw heel. You clamp your jaw and twist your ankle until the boot peels off with a suctioning *pop*, leaving your sock and bare heel exposed. The rebar rakes you again on the way out—warmth blooms in the water around your foot.\n\nFree—mostly. Bleeding, but free.\n\nA cable bundle brushes your shoulder in the dark: old conduit guts, slick with algae slime, still anchored somewhere above. You grab it with both hands. It’s thicker than you hoped and it *moves* under load—stretching, not breaking. You haul, hand-over-hand, and your partner stays locked to your belt, kicking at the wall to keep both of you from being spun into the sump’s pull.\n\nThe cable creaks against a bracket. Your shoulders burn. The current tries to peel you off like a label.\n\nYou gain about a body-length—enough that your head breaks into a pocket of trapped air under a low ledge. You can breathe, but it’s stale and tastes like wet copper.

Your bare, bleeding heel keeps slipping when you try to find wall purchase.\n\n**Outcome:** you successfully tore free of the rebar snags and got you and your partner up into a small air pocket under a ledge by hauling the cable; you lost your boot and you’re bleeding from hip and heel; the pursuers have detected you below and are probing the drop.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Air pocket under ledge (below bypass lip)\"],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```"

They jam fingers in and *hold*—white knuckles, wrists trembling. The hatch seam opens another sliver under their grip. Clean air pours harder now, cold and pressurized enough to make the hair on your forearms lift.\n\nYou jam two fingers into the cracked corner yourself and saw them along the seam.\n\nOutcome: the sealant peels and tears in a ragged strip. Your fingers come back slick—part sealant, part blood where the hatch edge bites. The gap widens to maybe two finger-widths along a short run.\n\nConsequence: the hatch still doesn’t lift. The bolts are still doing their job. What you’ve made is a *vent* and a *purchase point*, not an exit.\n\nYour threat down the shaft—“Got a cutter?”—gets an immediate answer, not the one you want.\n\nA voice below, calm and close: “You don’t have a throat to cut from up there.”\n\nThen: a harsh metallic *snip-snip* as someone starts cutting at the cable loop binding the chain. The chain feed resumes, link by link, scraping up concrete. You feel the vibration through the rungs as it climbs.\n\nWorse: they change the hook’s role. Instead of fishing for your ankle, the hook-man starts hammering the pole upward like a battering ram, striking the riser wall and rungs to rattle you loose while the chain comes up to grab.\n\nThreat is now twofold and immediate:\n1) The chain is coming up fast—once they get a loop over a rung or around a leg, they can haul you down or pin you in place.\n2) The hatch seam is open only a couple finger-widths—enough for air and fingers, not enough for a body—and the sharp edge is already cutting you as you work it."

You gain a narrow crescent opening on the left side, maybe the width of two knuckles at its widest point. Clean air gushes out in a steady stream, strong enough to flutter loose grit down the shaft.\n\nConsequence: the bolts are still seated. You’ve turned the hatch into a partially lifted, bolt-stopped lid—an opening that can take fingers, maybe a thin tool, but not a head or shoulder. And forcing it like this makes noise: the bolt metal squeals against the hatch plate, loud and sharp.\n\nBelow, the response is immediate and practical. The calm voice barks, “They’ve got purchase—CUT THE BOLTS.”\n\nYou hear splashing footsteps reposition. Then a new sound joins the chain’s scrape: a battery grinder or saw waking up—high, angry whine—somewhere just below the riser mouth, angled up toward the bolts you can’t see from beneath.\n\nThe chain keeps climbing too, now used as a stabilizer: they’re feeding it up to brace whoever’s bringing the cutter into position.\n\nThreat, clear: you’ve created a small opening but not an exit; the pursuers are about to put a cutter on the bolts from below. If they cut the wrong thing (or deliberately cut the hatch edge), the hatch can drop or shift suddenly—your partner’s fingers are in the seam, and your shoulder is under the left edge.

You get a hairline gap: enough to keep air leaking, not enough to see through.\n\nYou snake your hand up through the crescent opening you’d made earlier—only now it’s mostly gone. Your fingers find the underside of the hatch plate and the bolt ends: smooth, round shanks with very little to grab. These aren’t old hex heads you can spin; they feel like carriage bolts or security bolts—domed on top, with the nut side likely *above* the hatch in whatever clean space is feeding that air.\n\nYou probe, frantic and precise: you do find one thing—wire. A short length of thin steel safety wire or tie, looped through a tab near one bolt, probably meant to keep something from vibrating loose. You can hook it with a finger and pull it taut, but it won’t shear by hand.\n\nBelow, your bark gets an answer—snarled laughter and then a hard, practical repositioning.\n\n“Back off the mouth!” someone shouts. The grinder whine shifts angle, farther down the shaft—safer from the hatch’s drop line. They’re not cutting blind at the seam anymore.\n\nThen the chain changes purpose again: instead of rising, it goes taut and *stops*, braced. A second later the hook-pole slams upward—not at your ankle now, but at the hatch edge itself. They’re trying to rattle your boot out of the seam and force the hatch to sit flush so you lose even that hairline gap and any reach.\n\nYou feel the hatch shudder with each strike. Your boot vibrates against metal; if it slips, the seam closes and your hand is trapped against a domed bolt end with nowhere to withdraw fast.\n\nAnd under all of it—subtle but real—you catch movement off to the side in a flooded culvert slit: a snorkel mask lens glints once, then disappears. Water ripples where someone quietly shifts position.\n\nThreats now:\n- Hook-pole impacts can knock your boot free and slam the hatch shut on your hand.\n- The grinder is repositioning for a safer cut—likely the chain, or the hinge, or something that makes the hatch fail in a way you can’t control.\n- Someone nearby is tracking the situation from cover, close enough to report or intervene."

You slash at what you can reach—his wrist strap and the light lanyard—then drive your heel into his forearm.\n\nOutcome: the cut bites through webbing and into skin. The strap parts with a snap; his light jerks loose and swings, smacking the wall. Your kick knocks his forearm off the rung.\n\nHe loses his hold.\n\nFor half a second he’s just weight and panic. Then his other hand snatches a lower rung, but the injured arm flails and scrapes the wall. His boots skid, ringing rungs as he drops two, maybe three steps before he catches himself. He howls, raw and close: “YOU—!”\n\nThe diver below throws the beam up instinctively; the shaft fills with jittering glare and your shadow stutters across the concrete. The pursuer tries to climb again, but his cut strap and bleeding hand make him hesitate—he’s shaking it out, trying to regrip.\n\nYou drop past him.\n\nConsequence: there isn’t room to “slip by clean.” Your shoulder clips him; he swings into you. His free hand claws at your jacket and finds fabric. For a heartbeat he has you by the back seam.\n\nYou tear free—leaving cloth in his fist—and hit the junction hard on your feet and one knee. Pain shoots up your shin where you smack the concrete lip.\n\nYou dive into the service throat low and start crawl-sprinting back downslope.\n\nImmediate reaction: the diver commits. They don’t follow into the throat yet—they shove the light to the mouth and angle it to pin you. “Stop! STOP!” comes muffled through the regulator, and then the hard *clack* of something metal on metal—like a hook-pole tip tapping for reach.\n\nBehind them, the pursuer drops to the junction, breathing harsh, voice gone mean and steady now: “She’s running it back. Cut her off—culvert side.”\n\nThreat, clear: they’ve got your line-of-sight with the beam and they’re switching from chase to containment. If there’s a second entry—or someone already staged in the culvert slit—you’re sprinting into a pinch point with a light behind you and a possible body ahead.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"Torn jacket scrap (partial)\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```"

It catches.\n\nThe hook-pole tip *clinks* into the cable and the bundle wraps half a turn around it. At the same moment it slaps the diver’s light, smearing the beam into a dirty flare and knocking it off-angle. The diver jerks back, regulator barking. “—tangled!”\n\nYou flatten and push into the darkest edge, shoulder scraping the wall. Your breath is loud in your own ears; the throat is tight enough that every movement is a rasp of fabric and grit.\n\nConsequence: the cable trick buys you a second, but it also gives them something to pull.\n\nYou feel it: the bundle goes taut behind you, dragged hard. The hook-pole is being used like a winch to sweep the throat. Metal scrapes concrete as they drag it side-to-side, probing for your legs.\n\nYou reach the first bend—warm draft, right kink—just as the beam steadies again. The light knifes down the throat and catches your boot sole for a blink.\n\n“No—there!” the pursuer snaps, voice raw but focused.\n\nYou search for a seam, a takeoff—anything before committing around the bend.\n\nThere is one: a recessed wall box on the right side just before the kink, its cover plate hanging by one screw. It’s dark inside, just big enough to jam a body into if you fold hard, but it’s not a tunnel—more like a service cavity with cable stubs and sharp edges.\n\nYou take it immediately, twisting in sideways. The loose plate grates against your ribs. Inside, you’re pinned tight; the air smells like old rubber and mouse-dry rot.\n\nOutside, the hook-pole scrapes closer, dragging the cable. The diver’s beam sweeps the floor, then the walls. The pursuer’s boots slosh in the shallow film, stopping right at the kink.\n\nThreat: if the beam hits the wall box opening, you’re found at arm’s length with nowhere to run. And the cable you used is still taut—if they keep hauling, it could snag on the box lip and *point* straight at you.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Recessed wall box (dark, right side)\"],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```"
