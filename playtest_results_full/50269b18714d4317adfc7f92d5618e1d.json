Beyond the bay doors, the derelict hulk hangs in slow spin, emergency strips pulsing on its skin like weak signals.\n\nYou stand on the mag-plate ramp at the mouth of the boarding tube, helmet sealed, rifle slung but ready. Your left glove runs a practiced sweep over the tube’s latch points—tamper seal, hinge wear, microfracture—same routine you used on live-ops breaching collars. You mark angles and blind spots with quick glances, then tap your wrist slate to start a continuous bodycam loop Helix can’t “misplace.”\n\nA Helix handler strides up the ramp, short and broad in a patched vac-suit with a cooperative emblem stitched over old scorch marks. Their name tag reads **Pell**. They don’t meet your eyes; they hold out a **sealed black-box canister** like it’s hot. “Recovered from a frost-welded compartment,” Pell says, voice flat through comms. “Log it as nonfunctional debris. Don’t open it. Don’t mention it.” The canister hums against your palm, faint through the insulation, and your visor flashes a residue scan without being asked: **BIOMETRIC MATCH—MARA VANCE / USMC ID**. The timestamp crawls in after it, years after your discharge.\n\nBefore you can speak, your comms crackle—port security broadcast, clipped and polite: **“Detainment notice. Mara Vance. Report for Admiralty debriefing.”** Down on the deck, two dock guards shift their stance toward the ramp. At the far edge of the bay, three workers in Vesper-gray coveralls stop pretending to load crates; one lifts a handheld receiver, and it chirps a repeating pattern that tightens in your ears when the canister is close.\n\nPell’s hand hovers near the canister seal, the guards start walking, and the Vesper runners watch you like they’ve finally found the right signal. You are holding evidence the Admiralty buried—and everyone here just moved at once.",

The hum doesn’t stop; it migrates—now it’s against your ribs, a distant vibration that makes your teeth feel slightly too present. Your rifle comes up to low-ready, muzzle down the tube.\n\n“Pell—move. Now.”\n\nPell flinches and sidesteps hard, nearly clipping the handrail, giving you the lane without argument. “Mara—don’t—” is all they manage before swallowing it.\n\nYou hit the boarding tube at a brisk walk that turns into a controlled push. Halfway up, the nearer dock guard commits—boots clack on the ramp, body angling to block. “Vance! Stop. Admiralty—”\n\nYou don’t stop. You drive your shoulder through his chest plate.\n\nThe impact is real, not cinematic: his breath barks out, he pinwheels, and the mag in his boots fails for a half-second as his heel skates. He slams into the deck grating and stays down, one arm curling around his ribs, helmet ringing. His partner yells, “Assault! Lock the tube—lock it!”\n\nA klaxon begins to wind up in the bay—low, rising. The boarding tube’s inner bulkhead light flips from green to amber as the station tries to engage a safety interlock behind you. The door doesn’t slam shut—too slow, too much inertia in the mechanism—but you hear the latch motors start to cycle.\n\nFrom the bay behind, the Vesper workers peel off their crates. One of them—thin, shaved head—raises a compact launcher the size of a forearm. Not a gun: a **net-stapler**. “Don’t damage her!” someone barks. They’re aiming up the tube after you.\n\nAhead, the derelict’s outer hatch is already dogged open just enough for a person to slip through—like someone prepped it before you arrived. Cold breath spills out of the gap, carrying that old coolant tang.\n\nYou’re ten meters from the derelict hatch. Behind you: an alarm, one guard down, one calling in, and Vesper lining a capture shot up the tube. The station interlock is trying to close the tube behind you, but it hasn’t caught yet.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"Sealed black-box canister\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Kestrel Spindle Station - Dock 9 boarding tube\",\"Derelict outer hatch (ajar)\"],\"npcs_add\":[\"Pell (Helix handler)\",\"Dock Guard #1 (injured)\",\"Dock Guard #2 (active)\",\"Vesper runner (shaved head)\",\"Vesper runners (2 others)\"]}\n```",

The second round takes the shaved-head runner in the hand—clean through the webbing between thumb and forefinger. He howls and drops the launcher, blood globing and drifting in slow beads before his suit’s microseals cinch and smear it into a dark stain.\n\n“Fuck—MED!” one of the other Vesper workers shouts, but they don’t rush him; they flatten instead, suddenly wary of your sightline. Dock Guard #2 ducks behind the ramp strut and barks into his mic, “She’s armed, she’s boarding—seal that tube!”\n\nYou dive through the derelict’s ajar hatch.\n\nCold hits like a slap. The interior is dim, emergency strips pulsing weakly. Your boots find purchase on a frost-slick deckplate; you catch yourself on the inner frame, then pivot back to the hatch.\n\nYou dog the wheel shut—metal groans, old seals complain—and slam the emergency lock lever down. It *clicks* into place… then immediately chatters, like it can’t decide if it’s engaged. You yank a manual release cable and feel it bite your glove, stiff with ice. The hatch stays shut, but not cleanly; there’s a thin, bright line at the seam where the gasket doesn’t fully seat.\n\nFrom the other side, something impacts the hatch—boots or a shoulder—once, hard. The wheel judders in your hands. A voice muffled through the metal, Dock Guard #2: “Open it! You’re under detainment—”\n\nYour comms spit static, then Pell comes through, breathing fast. “Mara—listen. I didn’t— I swear I didn’t prep anything. That hatch was logged *welded* yesterday.” A pause, then quieter, scared: “Helix doesn’t have cutters that clean. Admiralty does. And—” their voice drops further— “Vesper’s been paying station hands to ‘soften’ seals. Someone wanted you inside.”\n\nBehind you, deeper in the derelict, a panel ticks in time with the ship’s slow spin. Your visor briefly highlights a smear on the bulkhead beside the hatch—like a handprint in oil-black residue—fresh enough to shine. It is on the *inside* of the ship.\n\nOutside the hatch, the pounding stops. Not because they gave up—because they’ve changed tactics. You hear the faint whine of a tool spooling up against the seam, searching for purchase on the imperfect seal.",

The hatch wheel jolts once, then the lock’s chatter turns into a single ugly *clunk* as something inside warps out of alignment.\n\nOn the other side, the cutting whine stutters and stops. A muffled curse carries through the hatch. Whatever tool they had just lost its bite—at least for the moment.\n\nBut your shots also do something else: the inner gasket smokes, and the air right around the seam turns sharp and acrid. Your visor flags a brief pressure fluctuation as the damaged seal “breathes” once—an inward sip—then stabilizes. The hatch is more *jammed* than *sealed* now.\n\nYou pull your knife and scrape the oil-black smear. It doesn’t flake like grease; it comes up in a thin, tacky ribbon that strings for a second before snapping into the patch pouch. The residue clings to the blade like it wants to crawl back.\n\nYou sweep your rifle light down the corridor.\n\nThe beam cuts through drifting dust and frost motes. Ten meters in, the passage bends left around a ribbed bulkhead. Along the right wall: conduit runs beaded with condensation, and a maintenance alcove with its cover hanging open. Inside that alcove, a status panel is dark—except for a single diode that blinks in a pattern that doesn’t match the emergency strip cadence. Once your light hits it, it pauses, then resumes—slower.\n\nPell comes back on comms, voice tight. “Dock 9 Admiralty presence isn’t a team—there’s no manifest. That’s the problem. Port Security got a detainment notice routed from *Office of Anomalous Losses*, stamped by a clerk ID: **Lysa Koen**. That name’s been on Helix ‘audit’ emails before.”\n\nA beat of static, then: “Internal cameras—if they’re still powered, they’d be on the ship’s old security loop. Map… there should be a deckplan in the service crawl or a bridge terminal, but this hull’s registry is scraped. Helix couldn’t pull a schematic. If you find a working node, ping me its port ID and I’ll try to handshake.”\n\nOutside the hatch, you hear boots repositioning—two sets at least—then a quieter sound: something being taped or clamped to the metal, careful and deliberate. Not prying now. Setting.\n\nWhatever they’re doing, they’re preparing to force the hatch without cutting it.",

The cover is already half-hung; you rip it wider. The hinge squeals and a brittle strip of frost shears off.\n\nInside: a compact service bay—old ship-standard. A manual atmosphere tap (three-position lever), a diagnostics jack, and a palm-sized status screen that should be dead. The blinking diode isn’t a simple indicator; it’s a tiny optical sensor, jury-rigged onto the bay’s frame with station tape. Someone planted it here recently.\n\nWhen your light hits it, the sensor’s blink pattern changes again—then the status screen *wakes* with a thin green line of text, like it’s been waiting for motion:\n\n**NODE 3A — ACCESS: DENIED**  \n**LAST AUTH: VANCE, M.**  \n**TIME: — — : — — : — —**\n\nNo timestamp. Just your name.\n\nYou jam your fingers into the diagnostics jack looking for an exposed port ID. The jack collar is warm compared to the surrounding metal, like current has been running through it. Stamped into the plate beneath: **3A-19**.\n\nBehind you at the hatch, the careful clamping sound stops. A new sound replaces it: a soft, escalating whirr—an inflator or a chemical bladder pressurizing against the seam. A wedge charge, meant to force the hatch by brute expansion rather than cutting. The wheel trembles a fraction, then holds… for now.\n\nPell answers, fast. “I don’t have reliable pressure numbers—Helix logs say the hulk’s at *maintenance atmosphere*, thin but present. Enough to fog your visor, not enough to explosively vent a team. If you punch a hole, you’ll get a pull, not a decompression blast. It might drag loose debris and it’ll scream in their ears—but it won’t suck them out like a movie.”\n\nAs Pell talks, the service bay screen adds a second line, unprompted:\n\n**CAM LOOP: ACTIVE**  \n**FEED: /HATCH/DOCK9**\n\nSo yes—there are cameras.

The helmet vanishes from the slit.\n\nFrom the other side, someone shouts, panicked and close: “Back—BACK—there’s a charge—!”\n\nToo late.\n\nThe strip-charge goes off inside the seam with a flat, concussive *WHUMP* that you feel in your teeth more than you hear. The hatch ring deforms and the gap flashes orange-white; fragments of gasket and a spray of frost and black oil spit into the corridor like shrapnel. The hatch wheel snaps a fraction, then locks crooked.\n\nYou peel back around the bend as the blast wind slaps down the corridor, carrying burned adhesive, propellant, and that coolant-metal tang. A second later, return fire rakes where you were—two sharp cracks and impacts chewing the ribbed bulkhead edge, sending needle-splinters of alloy pinging into the deck.\n\nOutside the hatch, a voice—Dock Guard #2, strained—barks through the damaged seam: “Cease fire!

She’s armed and you’re not cleared—”\n\nSomething heavy scrapes against the hatch from the outside—like a shoulder or a tool braced against the ring. The seam flexes a fraction wider, protesting with a metallic squeal.\n\nThe amplified voice answers, still calm, but closer and more directive: “Vance, you have already fired on station security. Continued resistance will be treated as hostile action. Stand down.”\n\nA sharp *thup* follows—another object strikes the hatch and clings. Not a cylinder this time: a flat puck the size of your palm, magnet-locked to the ring just above the seam. A faint blue arc skitters across its edge as it wakes up.\n\nThe whistle changes pitch.

Not a body: a length of salvage cable strung across the corridor, now visible because the flash lit the condensation on it. It catches your rifle and slams it sideways into the bulkhead with a metallic *clang* that echoes down the hull.\n\nAt the same moment, the “scrape” you were tracking shifts—now behind you, closer to Dock 9.

Not clean. Your suit’s broadcasting but the image is… doubled. Hold—” A pause, keys clicking. “Door stack moved. Someone yanked the inner door and then it slammed back. I saw a body go past the seam—couldn’t tell if it was your runner or—” He swallows audibly. “—or you.”\n\nYou crawl deeper. The service chase is tight enough your rifle scrapes conduit housings; your shoulder bumps a junction box marked **3A-19** in flaking stencil. The hum in your gloves is gone—either the canister’s seated and insulated, or the chase metal is eating the vibration.\n\nBehind you, from the corridor you dropped out of, the sound comes: a dry, patient *tck… tck… tck*, like a tool testing the same spot again and again. Then a longer drag—metal teeth worrying at the chase lip where you entered.\n\nAs you pivot to cover the opening, your gray visor briefly overlays a ghost image: a silhouette of you, crouched in the corridor outside the chase, rifle up, looking straight into the access. It’s there for less than a second—then it snaps back to blank gray.\n\nPell’s voice tightens. “Mara, don’t move— I’m seeing you in two places again. One’s in the chase—one’s outside it, aiming in. Which one is you? Say something only you’d know.”\n\nThe *tcking* stops. In the silence, something breathes just once—too close to be down the corridor.

The “head” doesn’t explode like flesh—your rounds punch through with a brittle *crack* and a spray of glittering shards that ring off the chase walls. For a fraction of a second the pit lights from within, like a camera sensor overloading, and then it goes dark.\n\nThe jointed arm convulses. Your boot connects hard at the first elbow-joint and you feel it give—not bone, more like a composite strut snapping. The arm whips back out of the opening with a scraping yank that peels a strip of metal from the chase lip.\n\nYou back-crawl deeper, rifle steady on the access.\n\nConsequence: it’s not gone.\n\nFrom the corridor side, something drags the damaged arm away, and you hear the pry-tool thing reposition—multiple contact points now, faster, more coordinated. The access frame shudders as if it’s testing leverage for a rip rather than a reach.\n\nPell again, more focused. “Door stack— they’re not pushing in anymore. They’re backing off. Wait—” His breath catches. “No, one stayed. I’ve got heat at the access. And Mara— the other ‘you’ just turned its head toward Dock 9 like it heard me.”\n\nYour visor throws another ghost overlay: the corridor outside, empty—then a single oil-black handprint appears on the *inside* edge of the access frame, fingers splayed as if something just pulled itself close. The print is real; you can see it in the suit light, glossy against frost.\n\nThen the pry-tool thing makes a new sound—wet and electrical—like a taser arcing in coolant. The access screws begin to *walk* out of their threads one by one, not falling, but rotating as if turned by invisible fingertips.\n\nIt’s trying to take the whole frame off.",

The blade bites metal with a hard *clink* and holds. For half a second the access stops shuddering.\n\nThen the frame pulls—not outward, but *sideways*, as if the force is coming from an angle down the corridor. Your knife bends a few degrees with a protesting creak. The wedge slows the removal, but it doesn’t stop it.\n\nIn comms: “Pell, kill power—3A-19—now.

But Mara—Admiralty safeties won’t let me vent a live dock corridor without an override. And the override request pings their office.”\n\nOutside the access, the taser-in-coolant sound intensifies. The metal around your taped screws starts to frost over in a perfect ring, as if heat is being pulled out of it. The tape stiffens and cracks. One screw head pops free with a soft *tink* and floats for a heartbeat—then shoots sideways, yanked out of view.\n\nThe oil-black handprint on the inner edge *smears* upward, though nothing touches it.

The frame is being “unmade” at the seam.\n\nPell again, strained. “Attempting section cut. If it works you’ll lose suit relay and lights in that run.

The drone’s clacking slows, then resumes—careful, feeling for you through vibration. It’s close enough now that you can hear its servos micro-correcting, a tiny whine between clicks.\n\nYou surge up.\n\nYour knife hits the nearest grapple assembly with a solid *CHUNK*—blade wedged into a joint seam packed with grit and insulation fuzz. You twist hard. The grapple’s claw spasms, tries to clamp, and catches the knife spine instead of you. Metal squeals.\n\nThe joint gives—partially. You rip one claw free of the lattice, but the drone’s other grapple snaps tight in reflex and holds it up for a heartbeat longer. That heartbeat is enough for the damaged torch arm to spit a brief, unstable arc: it lashes the cable bundle beside your shoulder, scorching insulation and releasing a sharp, acrid puff.\n\nThen the drone drops.\n\nIt hits the crawl floor with a hollow bang. You stomp down hard—once, twice—caving in a side panel and crunching something that sounds like a cooling fin. It still twitches, trying to roll, so you put two rounds into the body core at contact distance.\n\nThe core ruptures with a wet *pop* of dielectric gel. The drone goes slack. The clacking stops for good.\n\nImmediate consequence: the earlier arc-sputter and your shots weren’t quiet in this space. A few meters ahead, deeper in the chase, something answers—three fast taps against hull skin, like a knuckle test, followed by a dragging scrape that moves away along the outer plating.\n\nYour comm is still mostly jam-fuzz, but a thin slice of Pell bleeds through between bursts of static: “—heard that. Mara, you just lit up the trunk. Something else is pinging back—”\n\nAs you move forward, carefully, your boot brushes the scorched cable run. The insulation is blistered; a thin thread of smoke curls up, and a warning icon flickers on your visor: **LOCAL TEMP RISE / POWER LEAK**. Not catastrophic yet—but the chase is now warmer, and it smells like burned polymer.\n\nTen meters on, the chase narrows around a junction brace.

Jammer down. I’ve got you—Mara, listen: that drone wasn’t on Helix stock control. Something in the hull is spoofing local carriers. I saw a handshake pulse right after your shots—came from ahead of you in the chase.”\n\nYou drop to the scorched cable run. It’s not a full power conduit—more like a bundled control line with a thin feed. The insulation is split and weeping a faint, shimmering fluid that beads and runs along the braid.\n\nYou clamp it hard. The clamp bites; the leak slows to a trembling thread. You wrap tape over it in tight spirals. The tape sticks, but it doesn’t like the heat-softened insulation—your wrap holds for now, though you can feel it wanting to creep.\n\nOutcome: the smoke stops, the temp warning on your visor drops from **RISE** to **STABLE**, and the acrid smell fades to a dull burnt-plastic stink.\n\nYou shoulder the rifle, keep the light low, and ease into the junction narrowing. The brace forces you to angle sideways—muzzle up, cheek close to cold plating.

It’s like it isn’t returning lidar.”\n\nYou sweep your light up the seam and brace again. Full-bright glare turns the condensation into a glittering haze—every droplet becomes a tiny mirror. The ceiling smear is clearer now: not a handprint, not random drag. It’s a series of narrow streaks that converge and separate, like something with multiple contact points pulled itself along while keeping weight off the center.\n\nAs you take one careful step forward, the *tick* above you answers immediately—closer. Then a second tick, offset to the right. Whatever it is, it’s pacing your movement in short, deliberate placements.\n\nPell again, faster: “Range six. Bearing holding. Mara, I’m also seeing a carrier burst—tightband—coming off it. It’s not a jammer, it’s… it’s polling. Like it’s looking for something to answer.”\n\nYour visor flickers for a heartbeat—just a stutter in the HUD—then stabilizes. In that flicker you catch it: a shape interrupts the glare for a fraction of a second, clinging to the brace shadow. Not a person. Too low-profile, too jointed. Think insectile geometry, but wrong—segments that don’t match any drone chassis you’ve seen.\n\nIt doesn’t drop.\n\nInstead it slides sideways along the seam with a dry scrape, keeping itself tucked in the brightest glare where your depth perception is worst. A bead of oil-black residue falls free and hits your shoulder plate with a soft *tink*, then begins to crawl—slowly—toward the gap at your neck seal as if pulled by static.\n\nThreat, now explicit: a ceiling-crawling, non-lidar-returning entity is within ~6 meters, tracking you from above; it’s shedding active residue that is moving on your suit toward a vulnerable seal.",

But it’s doing something to your suit telemetry—your shoulder capacitance spiked when it touched. Conductive, yes. Alive? I—” He cuts himself off. “It’s responding. Your smear just changed its carrier burst. It noticed.”\n\nYou kill the light. The glare dies, and the chase becomes a black wedge with only your suit’s dim edge markers.\n\nYou pivot and fire.\n\nThe burst hammers the brace shadow—sparks jump, a strip of plating shivers, and something *hard* gets hit: a sharp, brittle crack like ceramic or sintered metal. A piece clatters down behind you and skitters across the deck.\n\nAt the same time, something drops—not the whole thing, just a portion—unfurling from the seam in a fast, jointed snap. It swings down on a thin, dark filament and *whips* toward your helmet.\n\nYou kick back out of the narrowing. The filament grazes your shoulder plate instead, leaving a wet, black streak. It recoils instantly—too fast to be passive—snapping back up into the seam before you can get the torch on it.\n\nYour torch flares anyway, bathing the narrowing in blue-white heat. You scorch the brace edge; frost hisses off the metal. You don’t catch the main body—but you do catch what fell.\n\nOn the deck, the skittering piece is a broken segment the size of two fingers, still twitching.

You’ve got one clean pulse before your suit starts complaining.”\n\nYou snap to the right-side conduit and put a controlled burst down the pipe.\n\nThe rounds ring the conduit like a bell. A shower of frost and oxidized flakes sprays out—then you see a small, matte-black segment *jump* from the pipe on impact, tumbling end over end. It doesn’t fall limp; it tries to catch the wall, filaments flicking for purchase.\n\nYou sweep the torch along the conduit run. The metal skins to a dull red in spots. The segment you knocked loose spasms midair as heat hits it—filaments curling inward—and it slaps the deck with a wet, oily sound, leaving a thumbprint smear that immediately begins to creep.\n\n“Mark!” you bark.\n\nPell hits it. Your suit thrusters slam a short, brutal pulse that punches air and dust outward in a cone. Loose grit and condensation explode off the deck. The panel scrap you kicked skitters away, exposing the blistered tar patch—then the pulse *peels* several hair-thin black threads out of the seams like pulled tendons, snapping a few and whipping others across the floor.\n\nUp on the ceiling seams, the effect is mixed: one cluster of ticking segments loses adhesion and drops—*not onto you*, but into the junction’s central cable tray with a metallic clatter. Another set holds fast, flattened so tight it looks painted on.\n\nThe pulse also does something you can’t take back: it drives the oil-black residue into motion. The creeping lines that had been retreating from your cauterized patch surge outward, following the airflow paths into bolt channels and conduit gaps—like it’s using your blast to map exits.\n\nPell, sharp: “Your suit just broadcast a signature spike. Dock 9 picked it up—so did something else. I’ve got a new carrier handshake riding your telemetry. It’s… it’s piggybacking.”\n\nYou backpedal toward the nearest hatch: a maintenance iris on the far bulkhead, half-open, labeled **NODE 3A-21** in flaked stencil. The iris is narrow but passable.\n\nAs you move, the threat clarifies:\n\n- From the central cable tray, something starts *moving toward the iris* ahead of you—ticking inside the tray, pacing your retreat.\n- From the ceiling seam above your path, a thin filament drops again, faster this time, aiming to touch down between you and the hatch.\n\nPell’s voice goes tight. “Mara—line incoming.

It doesn’t smear like grease; it smears like *wet ash*, leaving a charred crescent that tries to thread into the microgrooves around the fasteners. The torch follows your boot and you get a real burn on it—enough that the twitching stops. For the moment, that particular line is dead and not connected.\n\n“Pell, kill my telemetry—jam it or spoof it, I don’t care.”\n\nPell answers instantly, breathless. “Trying. I can’t hard-kill suit telemetry without taking your HUD and life-support diagnostics with it. I’m pushing a spoof—randomizing your packet timing and faking a dockside static storm. If they’re close enough to sniff raw RF, it won’t matter.”\n\nYou sprint the last steps and shoulder through **NODE 3A-21**.

The opening narrows… then sticks at a knife-blade gap.\n\nYou shove a boot into the seam and force it. The petals grind, scrape, and finally seat with a heavy *thunk*.

The first two punch through with a sharp *crack* and a spray of pale insulation dust.

Polymer fragments and latch metal spit out in a bright fan. One hinge shears; the lid twists, trying to lever itself open on the remaining hardware—then the rounds punch through and you hear the change in tone: *wet impact*, not hollow case. Black fluid jets from two new holes in thin, pressurized streams and spatters your shin plate. It doesn’t smoke. It clings.\n\nInside the coffin, something hits the lid hard enough to bow it—your knee catches it as you lunge in.

It’s inside the corridor wall behind the control panel, as if something is knocking from *within the bulkhead*. Then it stops.\n\nYou snap to the wall controls. The panel is old Helix retrofit over original ship systems: a three-position **COMPARTMENT ISOLATION** toggle (GREEN/AMBER/RED) and a guarded **VENT / PURGE** rocker with a cracked safety cover. A tiny status strip reads: **LOCAL ATM: 0.62 / FLOW: RECIRC**.\n\nYou hit isolation and then purge.\n\nIsolation flips to **RED** with a sharp relay clack.

Your suit pressure equalizes; your eardrums don’t pop, but the air gets thin fast.

The remaining strap finally gives with a soft, defeated tear.\n\nYou back into the corner, rifle up. The coffin lid opens another finger-width. In the gap you see not a face—just a dark, wet interior and something pale pressed against it from within, deforming like cartilage under pressure.\n\nThreat is immediate: **purge is pulling contaminated aerosol through the compartment (and onto your suit), the coffin is opening, and the floor seam is actively feeding toward the vent path—leaving a conductive-looking black smear up the wall and toward the controls.**",

It hasn’t stopped moving entirely.\n\n**The seam:** The widening floor seam is now a mouth-shaped opening about a forearm’s width at its widest, edges feathered with frost and black wetness. It continues to peel open—slower without the purge airflow, but steady. The black pool from the coffin is creeping toward it and disappearing as it reaches the lip, as if the seam is *drinking* it.\n\nImmediate threat: the coffin is still active (small movements, fresh fluid), and the seam is still enlarging and consuming whatever reaches it—while the black drip on the panel is one good smear away from fouling the controls.",

The black fluid surges first, pouring down like it’s been waiting for the angle, and the opening widens another few centimeters to accommodate the coffin’s corner.

The petals shudder in their tracks. The frozen black on the rim **shears**; chips of ice-black residue spall off and ping against the antechamber deck. The crushed limb, entombed in foam, **snaps off** at the seam and disappears back through the shrinking gap like it’s being reeled in.\n\nYou yank the nozzle operator by the shoulder strap. He stumbles hard, almost drops the gun, then lets it go and scrambles backward on hands and knees, white foam still drooling from the nozzle line. “Clear! Clear!” he yells, getting behind the inner bulkhead lip.\n\nContainment lead physically shoves one of his own techs out of the hatch’s line of travel. “BACK—NOW!”\n\nThe petals keep closing—grinding, protesting.

Lock won’t engage until seated. Do you want me to override and force—risking track failure?”\n\nThe hatch is almost closed but not locked.

Don’t run—don’t slip in that shit!”\n\nYour order to fall back works—mostly.

Each pulse makes the plate **tick** and flex like a drum skin. The clear-gray residue continues to bead and run; where it touches the upper stack, the hard case corner slumps further, and the stanchion angle changes again—less bite, more slide.\n\nThen the clicking changes character: it stops being “from the seam” and becomes **inside the hatch frame**, like something has moved into the thickness of the metal.\n\nA new sound follows: a slow, deliberate **ratcheting**—as if teeth are climbing the hatch dogs from the inside.\n\nBrace guy on the upper stack blurts, voice cracking, “It’s not pushing— it’s *unlatching*—”\n\nThe upper-right brace slips another centimeter. The plate jerks outward at the top edge, and a **dark line** appears behind it—an inner gap widening.\n\nYour retreat order creates distance, but the threat escalates: whatever is behind the hatch is now **working the hatch hardware**, and the compromised upper brace is losing its bite under chemical degradation. If the hatch dogs release, the hatch won’t “creep” anymore—it will **snap open** under stored pressure, sending the plate and any nearby bodies into the corridor like shrapnel.  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}",

We can’t hard-vent without purging the whole finger. We *can* throttle it and lock dampers.”\n\nYour visor pings as Dock Control pushes a thermal feed overlay. The bottom-right seam shows a thin, repeating temperature dip—like a pulse of cold—every three seconds. As the overpressure increases, the pulse doesn’t stop; it shifts. The cold dip tightens into a smaller spot, concentrating near the upper-right seam breach you already clocked, then spreads back out like it’s testing the boundary.\n\nGuard #2 moves when you bark—boots scuffing on grit—taking a knee to your left with his rifle braced on a bollard.

The foam collapses inward along that line.\n\n2) Near the upper-right seam breach, the foam *darkens* in a thumbnail-sized patch, turning gray and wet, as if it’s being dissolved from underneath. That patch “drinks” the foam faster than you can lay it down.\n\n3) The thermal overlay spikes: the cold pulse stops being rhythmic and becomes continuous at that dissolving patch—steady, deep cold.\n\nFrom inside the hatch, you get a sound like a fingernail dragged along metal—slow, deliberate—tracking along the seam under the foam.\n\nThe weld-drone above you twitches on its mag-clamps, rotates its head toward the breach, and emits a short, chirping error tone as if its proximity sensors just went blind.",

B is… not responding. We can’t get full isolation from here. Pressure’s stabilizing but you’ve still got bleed-through.”\n\nYou bury the AFFF nozzle into the dissolving spot and dump.

Not a blow. A measured pressure, like someone leaning their shoulder into it and testing your grip. The AFFF trapped under the panel hisses as it compresses.\n\nAbove, the weld-drone chirps again, rotates its torch head toward the plate edge… and then pauses. Its arm jitters, as if its control loop can’t find a stable surface. It lowers the tip anyway and spits a short tack.\n\nThe tack doesn’t spark the way it should.

The blade meets resistance, then slips into a narrow channel that shouldn’t exist in solid AFFF—like a straw-sized void. As you probe sideways, the foam around the knife collapses inward and you feel a faint *vibration* through the handle, a low hum that wasn’t there a second ago.\n\nGuard #2 tracks the seam. The containment lead leans into his sightline. Both are tense but controlled.\n\nDock Control comes back, voice clipped and strained. “We’re trying.

We can send a runner to the actuator trunk but—” a pause, someone in the background shouting, “—Clamp kit is moving. Thirty seconds.”\n\nYou snap at the weld-drone. It swivels, torch brightening. It drops to the hatch face and draws a fast ring of heat around the panel’s edge—no filler, just raw torch.\n\nThis time it *does* spark—but wrong. The metal doesn’t glow red; it flashes, then turns pale and crystalline, frosting outward from the heat line instead of receding. The ring you’re trying to burn becomes a white, brittle halo that crackles as it forms.\n\nThe pressure behind the panel surges in response—harder now, testing. The cart frame creaks. Your boot slips half an inch, catching again.\n\nThen the filament shows—not where you shot before. It extrudes from the *new* brittle halo, a hairline crack in the frost-ring, and it comes out fast, angling low toward your knife hand like it knows exactly where the gap is.\n\n“CONTACT!” Guard #2 fires two shots into the crack point. The rounds punch through the frosted halo, blasting shards outward. The filament jerks, whips once, and retracts—but not before it brushes the knife blade. The foam around your knife instantly thins, turning watery, and the channel widens.\n\nYou now have a compromised seam: the torch-created frost-ring is making the hatch face more brittle, and the thing inside is using those micro-cracks to “route” its filament toward any tool or hand near the gap.

HazMat is staging wraps—saw request acknowledged.”\n\nThen the hatch face *ticks*—a sharp, glassy sound. A new hairline crack races along the frost-ring on the lower right.\n\nA filament extrudes from it immediately, thicker than before—more like a black thread than a hair—and it doesn’t reach for hands this time. It lays itself flat against the hatch face and starts sliding along the frost-ring, probing for an edge, searching for a route under your plate.\n\n“FILAMENT!” Guard #2 rakes the halo with a short burst—three, four shots. The frosted ring shatters in little white chips, and the filament snaps back, but you feel the pressure behind the plate *shift* sideways in the same instant, like it learned where you’re weakest.\n\nYour brace jerks. The cart wheels squeal and slide a few centimeters. The panel edge lifts a fraction—just enough for a breath of gray vapor to puff out and instantly rim the gap with fresh frost.\n\nThe immediate threat is escalating: the brittle frost-ring is propagating cracks that the filament can use anywhere around the plate, and the force behind the breach is now testing lateral movement to pry up an edge. Your improvised brace is starting to slip.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[\"Seal tape (partial roll)\"],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[\"Station rigger (clamp kit)\"]}\n```",

Their name tag reads **Pell**. They don’t meet your eyes; they hold out a **sealed black-box canister** like it’s hot. “Recovered from a frost-welded compartment,” Pell says, voice flat through comms. “Log it as nonfunctional debris. Don’t open it. Don’t mention it.” The canister hums against your palm, faint through the insulation, and your visor flashes a residue scan without being asked: **BIOMETRIC MATCH—MARA VANCE / USMC ID**. The timestamp crawls in after it, years after your discharge.\n\nBefore you can speak, your comms crackle—port security broadcast, clipped and polite: **“Detainment notice. Mara Vance. Report for Admiralty debriefing.”** Down on the deck, two dock guards shift their stance toward the ramp. At the far edge of the bay, three workers in Vesper-gray coveralls stop pretending to load crates; one lifts a handheld receiver, and it chirps a repeating pattern that tightens in your ears when the canister is close.\n\nPell’s hand hovers near the canister seal, the guards start walking, and the Vesper runners watch you like they’ve finally found the right signal.

        "content": "Dock 9 of **Kestrel Spindle Station** is in its false-morning cycle, lights ramping up from red to pale white. Cold air tastes of oxidized metal and old coolant. Beyond the bay doors, the derelict hulk hangs in slow spin, emergency strips pulsing on its skin like weak signals.\n\nYou stand on the mag-plate ramp at the mouth of the boarding tube, helmet sealed, rifle slung but ready. Your left glove runs a practiced sweep over the tube’s latch points—tamper seal, hinge wear, microfracture—same routine you used on live-ops breaching collars. You mark angles and blind spots with quick glances, then tap your wrist slate to start a continuous bodycam loop Helix can’t “misplace.”\n\nA Helix handler strides up the ramp, short and broad in a patched vac-suit with a cooperative emblem stitched over old scorch marks. Their name tag reads **Pell**. They don’t meet your eyes; they hold out a **sealed black-box canister** like it’s hot. “Recovered from a frost-welded compartment,” Pell says, voice flat through comms. “Log it as nonfunctional debris. Don’t open it. Don’t mention it.” The canister hums against your palm, faint through the insulation, and your visor flashes a residue scan without being asked: **BIOMETRIC MATCH—MARA VANCE / USMC ID**. The timestamp crawls in after it, years after your discharge.\n\nBefore you can speak, your comms crackle—port security broadcast, clipped and polite: **“Detainment notice. Mara Vance. Report for Admiralty debriefing.”** Down on the deck, two dock guards shift their stance toward the ramp. At the far edge of the bay, three workers in Vesper-gray coveralls stop pretending to load crates; one lifts a handheld receiver, and it chirps a repeating pattern that tightens in your ears when the canister is close.\n\nPell’s hand hovers near the canister seal, the guards start walking, and the Vesper runners watch you like they’ve finally found the right signal. You are holding evidence the Admiralty buried—and everyone here just moved at once."

The hum doesn’t stop; it migrates—now it’s against your ribs, a distant vibration that makes your teeth feel slightly too present. Your rifle comes up to low-ready, muzzle down the tube.\n\n“Pell—move. Now.”\n\nPell flinches and sidesteps hard, nearly clipping the handrail, giving you the lane without argument. “Mara—don’t—” is all they manage before swallowing it.\n\nYou hit the boarding tube at a brisk walk that turns into a controlled push. Halfway up, the nearer dock guard commits—boots clack on the ramp, body angling to block. “Vance! Stop. Admiralty—”\n\nYou don’t stop. You drive your shoulder through his chest plate.\n\nThe impact is real, not cinematic: his breath barks out, he pinwheels, and the mag in his boots fails for a half-second as his heel skates. He slams into the deck grating and stays down, one arm curling around his ribs, helmet ringing. His partner yells, “Assault! Lock the tube—lock it!”\n\nA klaxon begins to wind up in the bay—low, rising. The boarding tube’s inner bulkhead light flips from green to amber as the station tries to engage a safety interlock behind you. The door doesn’t slam shut—too slow, too much inertia in the mechanism—but you hear the latch motors start to cycle.\n\nFrom the bay behind, the Vesper workers peel off their crates. One of them—thin, shaved head—raises a compact launcher the size of a forearm. Not a gun: a **net-stapler**. “Don’t damage her!” someone barks. They’re aiming up the tube after you.\n\nAhead, the derelict’s outer hatch is already dogged open just enough for a person to slip through—like someone prepped it before you arrived. Cold breath spills out of the gap, carrying that old coolant tang.\n\nYou’re ten meters from the derelict hatch. Behind you: an alarm, one guard down, one calling in, and Vesper lining a capture shot up the tube. The station interlock is trying to close the tube behind you, but it hasn’t caught yet.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"Sealed black-box canister\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Kestrel Spindle Station - Dock 9 boarding tube\",\"Derelict outer hatch (ajar)\"],\"npcs_add\":[\"Pell (Helix handler)\",\"Dock Guard #1 (injured)\",\"Dock Guard #2 (active)\",\"Vesper runner (shaved head)\",\"Vesper runners (2 others)\"]}\n```"

The second round takes the shaved-head runner in the hand—clean through the webbing between thumb and forefinger. He howls and drops the launcher, blood globing and drifting in slow beads before his suit’s microseals cinch and smear it into a dark stain.\n\n“Fuck—MED!” one of the other Vesper workers shouts, but they don’t rush him; they flatten instead, suddenly wary of your sightline. Dock Guard #2 ducks behind the ramp strut and barks into his mic, “She’s armed, she’s boarding—seal that tube!”\n\nYou dive through the derelict’s ajar hatch.\n\nCold hits like a slap. The interior is dim, emergency strips pulsing weakly. Your boots find purchase on a frost-slick deckplate; you catch yourself on the inner frame, then pivot back to the hatch.\n\nYou dog the wheel shut—metal groans, old seals complain—and slam the emergency lock lever down. It *clicks* into place… then immediately chatters, like it can’t decide if it’s engaged. You yank a manual release cable and feel it bite your glove, stiff with ice. The hatch stays shut, but not cleanly; there’s a thin, bright line at the seam where the gasket doesn’t fully seat.\n\nFrom the other side, something impacts the hatch—boots or a shoulder—once, hard. The wheel judders in your hands. A voice muffled through the metal, Dock Guard #2: “Open it! You’re under detainment—”\n\nYour comms spit static, then Pell comes through, breathing fast. “Mara—listen. I didn’t— I swear I didn’t prep anything. That hatch was logged *welded* yesterday.” A pause, then quieter, scared: “Helix doesn’t have cutters that clean. Admiralty does. And—” their voice drops further— “Vesper’s been paying station hands to ‘soften’ seals. Someone wanted you inside.”\n\nBehind you, deeper in the derelict, a panel ticks in time with the ship’s slow spin. Your visor briefly highlights a smear on the bulkhead beside the hatch—like a handprint in oil-black residue—fresh enough to shine. It is on the *inside* of the ship.\n\nOutside the hatch, the pounding stops. Not because they gave up—because they’ve changed tactics. You hear the faint whine of a tool spooling up against the seam, searching for purchase on the imperfect seal."

The hatch wheel jolts once, then the lock’s chatter turns into a single ugly *clunk* as something inside warps out of alignment.\n\nOn the other side, the cutting whine stutters and stops. A muffled curse carries through the hatch. Whatever tool they had just lost its bite—at least for the moment.\n\nBut your shots also do something else: the inner gasket smokes, and the air right around the seam turns sharp and acrid. Your visor flags a brief pressure fluctuation as the damaged seal “breathes” once—an inward sip—then stabilizes. The hatch is more *jammed* than *sealed* now.\n\nYou pull your knife and scrape the oil-black smear. It doesn’t flake like grease; it comes up in a thin, tacky ribbon that strings for a second before snapping into the patch pouch. The residue clings to the blade like it wants to crawl back.\n\nYou sweep your rifle light down the corridor.\n\nThe beam cuts through drifting dust and frost motes. Ten meters in, the passage bends left around a ribbed bulkhead. Along the right wall: conduit runs beaded with condensation, and a maintenance alcove with its cover hanging open. Inside that alcove, a status panel is dark—except for a single diode that blinks in a pattern that doesn’t match the emergency strip cadence. Once your light hits it, it pauses, then resumes—slower.\n\nPell comes back on comms, voice tight. “Dock 9 Admiralty presence isn’t a team—there’s no manifest. That’s the problem. Port Security got a detainment notice routed from *Office of Anomalous Losses*, stamped by a clerk ID: **Lysa Koen**. That name’s been on Helix ‘audit’ emails before.”\n\nA beat of static, then: “Internal cameras—if they’re still powered, they’d be on the ship’s old security loop. Map… there should be a deckplan in the service crawl or a bridge terminal, but this hull’s registry is scraped. Helix couldn’t pull a schematic. If you find a working node, ping me its port ID and I’ll try to handshake.”\n\nOutside the hatch, you hear boots repositioning—two sets at least—then a quieter sound: something being taped or clamped to the metal, careful and deliberate. Not prying now. Setting.\n\nWhatever they’re doing, they’re preparing to force the hatch without cutting it."

Stand by for a port ID. If they breach, I’m shooting through the hatch—so tell me now: is this hull pressurized enough to vent them if I pop something?”"

The cover is already half-hung; you rip it wider. The hinge squeals and a brittle strip of frost shears off.\n\nInside: a compact service bay—old ship-standard. A manual atmosphere tap (three-position lever), a diagnostics jack, and a palm-sized status screen that should be dead. The blinking diode isn’t a simple indicator; it’s a tiny optical sensor, jury-rigged onto the bay’s frame with station tape. Someone planted it here recently.\n\nWhen your light hits it, the sensor’s blink pattern changes again—then the status screen *wakes* with a thin green line of text, like it’s been waiting for motion:\n\n**NODE 3A — ACCESS: DENIED**  \n**LAST AUTH: VANCE, M.**  \n**TIME: — — : — — : — —**\n\nNo timestamp. Just your name.\n\nYou jam your fingers into the diagnostics jack looking for an exposed port ID. The jack collar is warm compared to the surrounding metal, like current has been running through it. Stamped into the plate beneath: **3A-19**.\n\nBehind you at the hatch, the careful clamping sound stops. A new sound replaces it: a soft, escalating whirr—an inflator or a chemical bladder pressurizing against the seam. A wedge charge, meant to force the hatch by brute expansion rather than cutting. The wheel trembles a fraction, then holds… for now.\n\nPell answers, fast. “I don’t have reliable pressure numbers—Helix logs say the hulk’s at *maintenance atmosphere*, thin but present. Enough to fog your visor, not enough to explosively vent a team. If you punch a hole, you’ll get a pull, not a decompression blast. It might drag loose debris and it’ll scream in their ears—but it won’t suck them out like a movie.”\n\nAs Pell talks, the service bay screen adds a second line, unprompted:\n\n**CAM LOOP: ACTIVE**  \n**FEED: /HATCH/DOCK9**\n\nSo yes—there are cameras.

The whirr spikes—pressure building.\n\nYou move back and slap a strip-charge onto the corridor wall beside the hatch.\n\nIt doesn’t stick.\n\nThe adhesive pad skates on a film you can’t see—oil-black, tacky in the wrong way, like it’s sweating out of the metal itself. You press harder; it slides again and leaves a smeared crescent on your glove. The charge’s arming LED blinks once, then steadies—armed, but not placed.\n\nAt the hatch, the wedge finally bites. Metal groans. The wheel twitches a quarter-turn on its own, not from hands—like the mechanism is being forced from the other side. A hairline gap opens at the seam and cold, thin air whistles in, carrying the sharp sting of propellant.\n\nA voice from outside, muffled by the hatch: “Hold—don’t—” then a bang as something shifts.\n\nThe gap widens to a finger’s width. A narrow beam of light stabs through from Dock 9, sweeping the corridor just below your position.\n\nYou’re in the dark with an armed strip-charge in your hand that won’t adhere, a breach in progress, and at least one person outside trying to control whoever’s forcing entry.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```"

The hatch wheel snaps a fraction, then locks crooked.\n\nYou peel back around the bend as the blast wind slaps down the corridor, carrying burned adhesive, propellant, and that coolant-metal tang. A second later, return fire rakes where you were—two sharp cracks and impacts chewing the ribbed bulkhead edge, sending needle-splinters of alloy pinging into the deck.\n\nOutside the hatch, a voice—Dock Guard #2, strained—barks through the damaged seam: “Cease fire! Cease—! We’ve got one down! Vance, don’t—”\n\nThen another voice cuts in over him, calm and amplified like it’s coming through an official mask amp: “Mara Vance.

She’s armed and you’re not cleared—”\n\nSomething heavy scrapes against the hatch from the outside—like a shoulder or a tool braced against the ring. The seam flexes a fraction wider, protesting with a metallic squeal.\n\nThe amplified voice answers, still calm, but closer and more directive: “Vance, you have already fired on station security. Continued resistance will be treated as hostile action. Stand down.”\n\nA sharp *thup* follows—another object strikes the hatch and clings. Not a cylinder this time: a flat puck the size of your palm, magnet-locked to the ring just above the seam. A faint blue arc skitters across its edge as it wakes up.\n\nThe whistle changes pitch. The puck starts to *cut*—not explosively, but steadily, heating the metal along the warp line.

Your suit screams a pressure warning in your ear; a thin, painful cold knifes into your foot.

If I crack the inner door without equalizing, port security will lock it and flag you. You want air moving? You have to give me a reason the system accepts.”\n\nAs you retreat, the bulkhead panel marked B-12 to your left—half hidden under grime and frost—gives a tiny internal *click*.

Transmit biometrics and stand by for containment response.”\n\nContainment. Not rescue.\n\nYou rise and drive straight into the closer runner.\n\nIt’s faster than it looked. It dips under your first swing by inches, then surges up into it anyway, accepting the hit to close distance. Your rifle butt smashes its faceplate/neck line with a hard *thunk*—the plate cracks, and its head snaps sideways.

Which one is you? Say something only you’d know.”\n\nThe *tcking* stops. In the silence, something breathes just once—too close to be down the corridor.

The “head” doesn’t explode like flesh—your rounds punch through with a brittle *crack* and a spray of glittering shards that ring off the chase walls. For a fraction of a second the pit lights from within, like a camera sensor overloading, and then it goes dark.\n\nThe jointed arm convulses. Your boot connects hard at the first elbow-joint and you feel it give—not bone, more like a composite strut snapping.

Wait—” His breath catches. “No, one stayed. I’ve got heat at the access. And Mara— the other ‘you’ just turned its head toward Dock 9 like it heard me.”\n\nYour visor throws another ghost overlay: the corridor outside, empty—then a single oil-black handprint appears on the *inside* edge of the access frame, fingers splayed as if something just pulled itself close. The print is real; you can see it in the suit light, glossy against frost.\n\nThen the pry-tool thing makes a new sound—wet and electrical—like a taser arcing in coolant.

Your barrel is left with a dull, etched band and a few pits—cosmetic now, but it’s been chemically kissed.\n\n“Pell, I don’t care about the ghost—stay on my signal and mark 3A-21 manual dogs.”\n\nPell comes back through a thin carrier, breath audible. “Copy. 3A-21 is a two-dog iris—opposed cams. Manual only. Mara—your signal just *spiked* when you torched it. Someone else is listening on the line—can’t tell who.”\n\nYou lunge to the maintenance iris. In the dark you find the recessed handhold, yank—metal squeals—and the iris gives you a tight crescent opening. You shoulder through, scraping plates, and whip around inside the small maintenance pocket beyond.\n\nAs you start dogging it shut, the thing hits the seam.\n\nNot as a limb—as pressure. The iris shudders and rebounds against your hands. Black filaments push into the narrowing gap like wet hair seeking airflow. You torch the seam: the filaments recoil, turning pale and brittle at the edge, flaking into drifting ash-like specks.\n\nBut the iris doesn’t close clean.\n\nOne filament gets past before you can seal it—thin as wire—and it anchors on the inside lip. You feel it through your glove as a faint vibration, like a live cable under tension. The manual dog wheel fights you, grinding as if grit is in the cam track.\n\nYou get the first dog halfway seated. The second won’t bite fully; something is *in the track*.\n\nOutside the iris, the duct wall dents again—five depressions—then slides away, repositioning. The pressure is no longer at the seam; it’s moving to find another weak point.\n\nInside the pocket with you: a single black filament, anchored and quivering, beginning to spread along the iris rim toward the dog mechanism."

What’s left on the iris lip is a faint, glossy stain and a line of tiny pits where it had “bitten” into the metal.\n\nYou jam your knife tip into the dog track and scrape.\n\nThe “grit” isn’t dust. It comes out in clotted granules—black, beadlike, slightly elastic. As you pry, it tries to cling to the knife like tack. You flick it off, then scrape again until the cam channel shows bare metal.\n\nOutside the seam, something presses once—hard—then slides away, as if it felt the seal firm up and decided not to waste mass there.\n\n“Pell—someone’s on the line. Ignore it. Tell me if this pocket has a purge port or anything I can vent.”\n\nPell: “Maintenance pockets usually have a purge stub—look for a capped valve, yellow ring.

Not forcing the seam now; feeling for the dogs, for the mechanism you just cleared.\n\nInside the pocket, your suit HUD pings a micropressure change—slight, localized—near the back wall. You turn and see it: a capped valve with a yellow ring, half-hidden behind a conduit bundle. The cap is filmed over with a thin black sheen, like someone painted it with oil and let it dry.\n\nThe threat outside has stopped trying to squeeze in.

The latch is tacky with the same black residue. You palm it anyway, twist hard, and it gives with a wet snap.\n\nThe panel pops inward.\n\nCold air rolls out—stale, metallic, and *moving*. The crawl is real, but it’s tight: a skin-chase between hull layers, lined with cable runs and a service lattice.

One of its rear grapples catches the upper grid, and it swings down like a pendulum, slamming into the crawl wall beside your head. The impact dents the thin paneling and makes the cable run shudder. You kick off sideways, scraping a knee hard against the service strut, and get out from under it as it flails.\n\nThe drone is still active—half-blind and angry.

You twist hard. The grapple’s claw spasms, tries to clamp, and catches the knife spine instead of you. Metal squeals.\n\nThe joint gives—partially. You rip one claw free of the lattice, but the drone’s other grapple snaps tight in reflex and holds it up for a heartbeat longer. That heartbeat is enough for the damaged torch arm to spit a brief, unstable arc: it lashes the cable bundle beside your shoulder, scorching insulation and releasing a sharp, acrid puff.\n\nThen the drone drops.\n\nIt hits the crawl floor with a hollow bang.

Something up there reacts—not with a scream, not with a fall, but with *speed*: a rapid staccato of ticks sprinting along the seam ahead of your flame, staying just beyond the hottest edge.\n\nPell, quick: “Shift—bearing one-eight-zero to two-one-five relative you. It’s not behind you anymore. It’s running your right wall-line.”\n\nYou keep moving until the passage opens into the first wider section—an old junction bay where the ceiling lifts and the conduits split. You plant your feet, stop the retreat, and sweep your light back along the ceiling.\n\nYour beam catches it cleanly for the first time.\n\nIt’s not one thing. It’s a *cluster* of brace-hugging segments—jointed, matte-black pieces linked by thin filaments—flattened against the seam like a folded exoskeleton. The torch heat has cooked the frost off it, leaving a wet halo of oil-black residue around its contact points.\n\nAs your light centers it, the cluster *reorients*—segments unfolding a few degrees, presenting different angles like a creature turning its face without moving its body. The tightband carrier Pell mentioned becomes audible as a faint, mosquito-thin whine in your helmet speakers.\n\nThen it does something worse than attack: it drops a line.\n\nA single filament releases from the seam and falls straight down, slow and precise, like it’s measuring distance. The tip touches the deck with a soft tap—right on the smear where you wiped the bead earlier. The residue on the floor answers, crawling toward the filament tip in branching threads.\n\nPell, voice tight: “It’s anchoring. Mara, it just made a link between the ceiling and your deck contamination.”\n\nThe threat is now explicit and immediate: the ceiling entity is using the oil-black residue to create a conductive/active connection in your junction bay—potentially to track you, interfere with your suit, or deliver something down the line."

For a half-second the seam glows with pinpoint orange beads where the filament meets the cluster.\n\nThen the line *lets go*.\n\nThe severed end whips downward, still burning in spots, and slaps the deck near your smear. The residue there reacts immediately: it pulls away from the heat in branching rivulets, like a living thing avoiding pain, and threads itself under the nearest deck-lip and bolt recesses. Your rake of flame cauterizes the *surface*, leaving a blistered, tarry patch—but you can see thin black lines still moving where the heat didn’t reach, disappearing into seams.\n\nUp at the ceiling, the cluster shifts hard—segments scissoring sideways along the brace. One piece drops, not onto you, but onto the wall conduit: it lands with a magnetic *clack* and skitters along the pipe toward your right flank.\n\n“Pell, if you can vent this bay or pop a pressure pulse, do it—now.”\n\nPell answers over a burst of frantic keying. “I don’t have control of local vents from Dock 9, Mara—this hulk’s not slaved to station. I can try to spike your suit’s thrusters for a pulse if you’ve got propellant, but that’ll blow your position and might shove you into the bulkhead.”\n\nYou kick a loose panel scrap over the crawling residue. The scrap slides, covers the blistered patch—then *shifts* a centimeter on its own, as if something underneath is pushing and testing the edge. A thin black thread squeezes out from under the panel and heads for the nearest conduit run.\n\nYou back up to the far side of the junction, rifle aimed high.\n\nFrom above, the ticking returns—now spread out. Not one set of placements: two, maybe three, moving in different directions along the ceiling seams. The torch didn’t kill it; it *split its attention*.\n\nPell, low and urgent: “Multiple returns now. Same no-mass problem. Mara—your rear tag just got pinged by that carrier again. It’s stronger.”\n\nImmediate threat: at least one segment has moved to your right-side conduit line and the residue is infiltrating deck seams under the panel; the ceiling cluster is repositioning into multiple contact points, likely to flank or drop additional lines."

A shower of frost and oxidized flakes sprays out—then you see a small, matte-black segment *jump* from the pipe on impact, tumbling end over end. It doesn’t fall limp; it tries to catch the wall, filaments flicking for purchase.\n\nYou sweep the torch along the conduit run. The metal skins to a dull red in spots. The segment you knocked loose spasms midair as heat hits it—filaments curling inward—and it slaps the deck with a wet, oily sound, leaving a thumbprint smear that immediately begins to creep.\n\n“Mark!” you bark.\n\nPell hits it. Your suit thrusters slam a short, brutal pulse that punches air and dust outward in a cone. Loose grit and condensation explode off the deck. The panel scrap you kicked skitters away, exposing the blistered tar patch—then the pulse *peels* several hair-thin black threads out of the seams like pulled tendons, snapping a few and whipping others across the floor.\n\nUp on the ceiling seams, the effect is mixed: one cluster of ticking segments loses adhesion and drops—*not onto you*, but into the junction’s central cable tray with a metallic clatter. Another set holds fast, flattened so tight it looks painted on.\n\nThe pulse also does something you can’t take back: it drives the oil-black residue into motion.

Dock 9 picked it up—so did something else. I’ve got a new carrier handshake riding your telemetry.

The filter alarm drops—there’s less to filter now.\n\nThe floor seam reacts immediately: the oil-black line that had been creeping toward the coffin lifts into a thin, writhing ribbon, pulled by the airflow, and smears up the wall toward the vent grille like a living spill trying to escape. Where it passes, it leaves a glossy track that doesn’t evaporate.\n\nThe coffin lid—still held at a narrow angle—shudders under the pressure change. Something inside shifts its weight toward the opening. Black fluid beads at the gap and is instantly atomized into a fine spray, drawn toward the vent. Your visor flashes: **BIO-AEROSOL CONTACT: EXTERNAL** as a peppering of droplets ticks against your faceplate.\n\nThen the coffin *moves*.\n\nNot sliding—*dragging itself* a few centimeters, scraping across the deck toward the floor seam’s widening mouth, as if the seam and the coffin are magnetized to each other. The remaining strap finally gives with a soft, defeated tear.\n\nYou back into the corner, rifle up. The coffin lid opens another finger-width. In the gap you see not a face—just a dark, wet interior and something pale pressed against it from within, deforming like cartilage under pressure.\n\nThreat is immediate: **purge is pulling contaminated aerosol through the compartment (and onto your suit), the coffin is opening, and the floor seam is actively feeding toward the vent path—leaving a conductive-looking black smear up the wall and toward the controls.**"

The corridor air stopped yanking toward the ceiling.\n\nThat’s what changed: the suction died, and the black smear that had been climbing toward the vent *fell* in slow, syrupy strings, draping the wall and the control panel edge like spilled oil.\n\nNow—right now:\n\n**The room/corridor:** Emergency strip lights pulse low. Dust that had been streaming is settling in a thin fog. The air is thin but stable; your visor no longer shows rapid flow. Sound is mostly your suit and a faint, distant hull groan.\n\n**The panel states:**  \n- **COMPARTMENT ISOLATION:** **RED** (hard isolate).  \n- **VENT / PURGE:** centered at **RECIRC/OFF** (no active purge).  \nThe panel face is streaked with a glossy black drip that has reached the bottom lip of the toggle housing but hasn’t shorted anything yet—no sparks, no dead display.\n\n**The coffin:** It is no longer “held” neatly at a crack. Your controlled bursts punched through the gap and into the interior; the lid is warped outward now, bent along the hinge line you’d already damaged. Inside, whatever was pressing against the gap has *withdrawn*—or collapsed. You can see shredded packing foam and a wet, dark cavity. Black fluid is pooling under it, thicker than before, spreading in a slow oval.\n\nThe coffin itself is moving in tiny increments: a jittering, stop-start drag, like something inside is still trying to reposition it without leverage. It hasn’t stopped moving entirely.\n\n**The seam:** The widening floor seam is now a mouth-shaped opening about a forearm’s width at its widest, edges feathered with frost and black wetness. It continues to peel open—slower without the purge airflow, but steady. The black pool from the coffin is creeping toward it and disappearing as it reaches the lip, as if the seam is *drinking* it.\n\nImmediate threat: the coffin is still active (small movements, fresh fluid), and the seam is still enlarging and consuming whatever reaches it—while the black drip on the panel is one good smear away from fouling the controls."

The coffin is heavier than it should be; it drags like it’s suction-cupped to the deck by the black pool. You heave anyway, boots skidding in the slick.

The black fluid surges first, pouring down like it’s been waiting for the angle, and the opening widens another few centimeters to accommodate the coffin’s corner.

Nobody crosses,” he repeats, eyes fixed on the seam.\n\nThe containment lead starts counting out loud, physically grabbing shoulders and checking faceplates and suit rings with a gloved hand. “Nine… ten… eleven… Tech Two, visor seal—hold still.” Tech #2’s breathing is fast and wet in his mic; not a full cough, but close. The lead points hard toward the corridor back to station-side med. “You. Quarantine. Now. Escort him.”\n\nDock Control comes back immediately. “Isolated run is flooding inert now—argon mix. Scrubbers at max. Lockdown on both sides of 3A-19 is in progress; I can hard-lock the station-side access in thirty seconds. HazMat team is en route, ETA four minutes—biomed scanner with them. Do you need us to inert-flood *your* side?” There’s a pause, then: “Be advised: inert on your side will drop O2 partial. You’ll need masks sealed or suit feed.”\n\nYou crouch and rake your light along the iris seam and the oil-black print.\n\nConcrete: the print has a wet sheen that **shouldn’t** be there in this cold air. Under the beam it glitters like thin oil, and you can see a faint *drag*—a narrow smear leading away from the palm toward the left, about thirty centimeters, then stopping as if whatever made it lifted clean.\n\nAt the bottom of the iris seam, your light catches something worse: a **steady, tiny stream of vapor** feathering out—more like breath through a pinhole than residual haze. It curls along the deck and *threads* toward the handprint, as if drawn to it.\n\nOn the other side of the door, the impacts stop. Replaced by a slow, rasping **scrape** that travels downward along the iris ribs, ending near that same bottom seam—like something aligning itself with the leak.\n\nThreat, explicit: the iris is not a perfect seal; there is an active **leak path** at the lower seam, and whatever is on the far side has noticed it and is working that exact point while inert flooding continues behind it."

Nearest responder is the welder lead with a canister; ETA ninety seconds.” A beat. “Thermal: I can give you station-side thermals on the iris housing through the bulkhead sensors, not a camera view. Sending overlay to your visor now.”\n\nYour visor pings and paints a crude heat map. Most of the iris reads cold-blue. The bottom seam you patched shows a thin orange arc—localized heat, like friction or something metabolizing just beneath the metal. It isn’t spreading, but it pulses: brighten… dim… brighten, in a slow rhythm that doesn’t match any station cycle.\n\nGuard #2 nods without taking his eyes off the seam. “Two-shot. Filament only.” He adjusts his angle so his rounds would rake *outward* into open deck, not into the door frame.\n\nYou lay down a second strip of tape over the blistered spot.

Someone has recently been here: heat-scuffed boot prints half-frozen into coolant frost, and a thin strip of emergency tape placed like a warning but with no text, as if language itself was avoided.",
