### Turn 4 [PLAYER]

Eldra “Moth” Quillwhisper grew up in a candlelit monastery-library where the ink sometimes rearranged itself into new stories. A wandering lantern-scribe, she roams graveyards, mushroom rings, and moonlit ruins to catalogue oddities that refuse to stay still. Inquisitive, bright-eyed, and gently irreverent, she treats even curses like puzzles begging to be solved. Her goal is to find the rumored Midnight Atlas, a book that maps not places, but the secret desires of the dead.

*Agent reasoning: Generated curious-style character for Dark Fantasy fantasy, whimsical, adventure*

### Turn 5 [GAME]

Here's your character:

**Eldra “Moth” Quillwhisper**
*Wandering lantern-scribe and occult cataloguer*

Eldra was raised in a candlelit monastery-library where living ink sometimes rewrote its own tales, teaching her to trust patterns more than proclamations. Chosen as a lantern-scribe, she left with a reliquary lamp and a travel satchel of warded paper, roaming graveyards, mushroom rings, and moonlit ruins to catalogue curiosities that refuse to stay put. Her gentle irreverence—half devotion, half mischief—lets her speak to the uncanny as if it were simply another text with missing pages.

**Traits:** Inquisitive, Bright-eyed and optimistic, Gently irreverent, Methodical note-taker, Brave around the uncanny
**Goal:** To find the rumored Midnight Atlas—a book that maps not places, but the secret desires of the dead—and record its truths before anyone can weaponize them.

### Turn 9 [GAME]

Night settles over **Larkspur Gate**, the eastern entrance to the **Old Necropolis**, where the curfew bells have just stopped and the last living visitors hurry out. Violet-dark fog clings to the stone path. The air tastes of wet paper and candle wax. Bone chimes on the gate shiver in the wind, each one striking a different note.

You stand just inside the arch, half-hidden behind a leaning angel marker, with your reliquary lamp hooded under your cloak. On your knee is a sheet of warded paper, and you write by touch as much as by sight—short lines, neat brackets, careful hashes. You compare the copied puddle-text to the ink that bled sideways into a crude margin-map: three circled mausoleums, one marked with a moth-wing sigil. You check the lamp’s wick-oil level like a ritual, then close your satchel before any wax-scent can carry.

Bootsteps scrape stone. A **Warden-Scribe** rounds the gatepost with a shuttered lantern and a slate badge of the **Candlelit Concord** pinned to his chest; his glove is stained with sealing wax. Behind him, a younger acolyte drags a canvas sack that clinks with confiscated lamps. The Warden stops a mourner ahead of you and says, flat and practiced, “Curfew inspection. Satchels open. Pages first.” The mourner’s journal is taken, thumbed, and dropped into the sack. The Warden’s eyes lift, catching the edge of your satchel strap, and his hand settles on the seal-stamp at his belt.

At the same time, a **Grave-Gild courier** slips through the bars of the gate like he belongs there: neat coat, gold-flecked gloves, and a mourning ribbon pinned too carefully. He doesn’t look at the Warden. He looks straight at you and extends a black envelope sealed with funerary gold. On the wax is a thumbprint you recognize from the monastery’s restricted stacks—someone who should be dead. The courier murmurs, “**Vigil-Auction. Lot Thirteen. Candle-authenticated.** They’re reading it aloud tonight.” He nods once toward the necropolis paths, where the stones ahead seem to repeat the same epitaph twice.

The Warden steps closer, lantern angled to your hands. The courier’s envelope waits, warm from his palm. Your lamp, your notes, and your name are all suddenly in reach of other people.

### Turn 10 [PLAYER]

I let my satchel hang open with exaggerated innocence, keeping my warded papers tucked under my knee. With my other hand, I accept the black envelope like it’s merely a receipt and murmur to the courier, “Lot Thirteen—whose voice are they ‘reading’ tonight?” Then I look up at the Warden-Scribe and say, “Of course—pages first. Are you confiscating, or simply inspecting?”

*Agent reasoning: The Warden’s about to search me, but that envelope’s seal is a bigger mystery—someone “dead” is calling. I’ll play compliant to avoid escalation while quietly taking the message and probing for details.*

### Turn 11 [GAME]

Your satchel gapes obligingly—empty mouth, honest lining. The Warden-Scribe’s lantern sweeps it anyway, light probing seams as if expecting ink to flinch. His eyes narrow at the absence.

The courier lets you take the black envelope. The wax seal doesn’t crack; it sticks to your thumb for a heartbeat like it recognizes skin. At your question, he leans close enough that his breath smells faintly of clove and grave-dust.

“Whose voice?” he repeats softly, as if tasting a forbidden word. “A *borrowed one*. They’ve hired a throat—someone who can read without *owning* the text. But the Atlas-leaf… it prefers the voice of the one who died with the thumbprint.” His gaze flicks to the seal, then away. “If that voice answers, the room goes very quiet.”

The Warden-Scribe steps in, putting himself between you and the gate’s shadow. “Inspecting,” he says, and the word is a verdict. He holds out his free hand—palm up—while his other thumb rests on the edge of his seal-stamp. “Pages. Any loose sheets. Any copied epitaphs. Any invitations.”

Behind him, the younger acolyte shifts the canvas sack; glass clinks again—at least a dozen lamps already taken.

The courier straightens, suddenly all professional distance. He does not intervene. He simply tucks his hands behind his back and looks at the Warden as if you’ve become a transaction concluded.

The Warden’s lantern tilts downward and catches the edge of the paper under your knee—a pale corner, too clean against wet stone. He sees it. His eyes sharpen.

“Stand,” he says, voice lower. “Move your knee.”

The immediate threat is plain: if you don’t, he’s close enough to grab your leg or stamp a sealing mark onto whatever you’re hiding; if you do, he’ll likely seize the warded sheet—and your satchel is already open, ready to be “found” wanting.

### Turn 12 [PLAYER]

I rise smoothly, “Of course,” and as I lift my knee I slide the warded sheet up under my cloak against my thigh, letting the black envelope fall onto the stone where the paper had been. I offer Halven Rook the envelope with two fingers. “An invitation, then—shall we see whose funeral it belongs to, Warden?”

*Agent reasoning: If I stand, he’ll take the warded sheet; if I refuse, he’ll escalate. I’ll comply but swap what he sees—use the envelope as a decoy and keep the warded paper stuck to me.*

### Turn 13 [GAME]

You stand. The warded sheet slides up clean under your cloak—no snag, no flutter—pressed to your thigh by the weight of the fabric. Halven Rook’s lantern follows the motion a fraction too late; he sees only your cloak settle.

The black envelope drops onto the wet stone with a soft slap. Gold-seal up.

Halven’s gaze goes straight to it. He doesn’t reach for it immediately. Instead, he lowers his lantern until the flame-light skims the seal and makes the thumbprint shine like an oil-slick. His jaw tightens.

“A Vigil-Auction mark,” he says, and the word “auction” comes out like a charge.

You offer it with two fingers. Halven takes it, but not from your hand—he snatches it off the stone with a strip of waxed cloth from his sleeve, as if the seal might carry contagion. He turns it once, reads the edge-script, then looks past you to the Grave-Gild courier.

The courier’s polite mask holds. He gives a tiny bow that means *no names will be spoken here*.

Halven’s seal-stamp comes out. He presses it against the envelope’s flap—hard enough to crease the paper—then speaks a short Concord phrase under his breath. The stamp leaves a pale, chalky sigil that *binds the flap shut* without breaking the gold wax.

“Confiscated,” Halven says plainly. “Syndicate paper doesn’t leave my custody.”

Acolyte Senn steps forward and opens the canvas sack. Halven drops the sealed envelope in. It lands among glass and metal with a dull clink.

Then Halven lifts the lantern to your face. “Now,” he says, “the page you were kneeling on. You moved too carefully for an innocent mourner.”

His free hand grips your satchel strap near your shoulder and gives a testing tug—enough to pull you off balance if you resist, not enough to look like an arrest to anyone watching.

Threat, clear and immediate: Halven is about to search you physically, and the warded sheet under your cloak will be found if he pats you down.

```json

```

### Turn 14 [PLAYER]

I go a little wide-eyed and let my satchel strap slip in his grip as if I’m compliant—then I hiss, “Careful—Concord ink burns when mishandled,” and quickly draw out a blank warded sheet from my satchel, snapping it open between us like a shield. “If you insist on inspection, Warden, do it by the book: you touch the paper, not me—unless you want your stamp-hand itching for a week.”

*Agent reasoning: Halven’s about to pat me down; I need to redirect his attention and get space. Causing a “warded paper” incident might make him step back and focus on procedure, not my thigh.*

### Turn 15 [GAME]

Your satchel strap slides through Halven’s grip without a struggle. For half a breath he looks satisfied—then your hand darts in and comes out with a **blank warded sheet**, snapped open so sharply it makes a papery *crack* between you and his lantern.

The warding takes the light oddly. Halven’s flame skates across the sheet and refuses to settle; the edges show a faint, milk-white filigree like dried salt. The air between you both pricks, as if a nettle-brush passed through it.

Acolyte Senn flinches and yanks the confiscation sack back a step, glass clinking. The Grave-Gild courier’s eyes flick to the sheet and then away, as if he’s seen this trick used to hide uglier things.

Halven stops tugging the strap. He holds very still, lantern raised, seal-stamp poised but not advancing. Your warning lands: not fear, but calculation.

“By the book,” he repeats, and there’s a thin edge of irritation. “You’re quoting Concord procedure like you’ve worn our wick-smoke.”

He does not touch the sheet with his bare hand. Instead, he takes the same waxed cloth he used on the envelope and lays it over his fingers, then reaches—slowly—to pinch the top corner of your “shield.”

The cloth smokes faintly where it contacts the warding. Halven’s eyes tighten; he feels it through the fabric.

“Cute,” he says. “Blank wards are for transport, not for posturing.”

Then he changes tactics. He doesn’t try to grab you. He angles his lantern down and to the side, casting light past the sheet to your cloak and thigh—searching for the *shadow* of what you’re still hiding. Senn, taking the cue, steps around to your left to get a second angle.

The threat becomes immediate and specific: they’re setting up a two-sided inspection to spot the concealed sheet under your cloak without laying a hand on you, and if either sees the outline, Halven can lawfully detain you for “concealment during curfew inspection.”

### Turn 16 [PLAYER]

I flick my reliquary lamp open just a thumb’s width so it gutters a sickly, distracting light, then step toward Halven as if to let him “see better,” turning my hip so the cloak sways—slipping the hidden sheet down into my boot with my heel. “Detain me if you must, Warden, but tell me this first—why are you binding Vigil-Auction mail without even breaking the seal? Afraid of what it would *say* in your own lanternlight?”

*Agent reasoning: They’re trying to silhouette the hidden sheet; I should remove the “evidence” without looking like I’m hiding it—using the blank ward as cover and a bit of misdirection with my lamp and a question to split their focus.*

### Turn 17 [GAME]

You crack your reliquary lamp a thumb’s width.

The light that leaks out is wrong for Concord craft—sickly, green-gold, like candlefat over pondwater. It doesn’t brighten so much as *edit*: Halven’s lantern-shadow stutters; the warded sheet in your hands shows its filigree more sharply; the wet stones briefly mirror a face that isn’t yours and then smear into unreadable script.

Senn gasps and reflexively draws back, blinking hard. Halven’s pupils pinch. He lifts his lantern higher, instinctively trying to dominate your guttering glow.

You step in—close enough that Halven has to either retreat or look like he’s being crowded. Your cloak sways with the movement. Your heel hooks, and the hidden warded sheet slides down, down—then catches.

It doesn’t go neatly into your boot. The edge snags on the boot’s inner seam and folds. A corner remains visible for a heartbeat, white as a tongue.

Halven sees it.

His hand shoots out—not to touch your body, but to clamp the *waxed cloth* over that exposed corner and pin it against your boot, using the cloth as a legal fig-leaf. The warding bites back: the cloth smokes again, and Halven’s stamp-hand twitches as if stung.

“Concealment,” he says, voice snapping into official cadence. “Curfew inspection. Concord custody.”

Senn moves to your other side and produces a thin cord marked with tiny candle-sigils—ready to loop it around your wrists if Halven gives the nod.

Your question lands anyway. Halven’s mouth tightens, and for the first time he looks genuinely wary of your lamp.

“I didn’t break the seal,” he says, low, “because I don’t let Syndicate words *choose a reader* under my light. That’s how they plant hauntings in honest throats.”

The Grave-Gild courier finally speaks, mild as a eulogy. “Warden Rook. Please. She’s making a scene.”

Halven doesn’t look at him. His eyes stay on your lamp-slit and the smoking cloth at your boot.

Threat, immediate: Halven is about to pull the warded sheet free (it may tear and scream its warding), and Senn is poised to bind you. If your lamp opens further, it may draw epitaph-spirits already drifting toward lamplight at the gate.

```

### Turn 18 [PLAYER]

I snap my lamp shut and lift both hands, the blank warded sheet held up like a surrender flag. “Easy—don’t pull it. I’ll take it out myself, slowly, and you can witness every inch.”  

I glance to the courier. “You hear him—Syndicate words choosing a reader. Lot Thirteen does that, doesn’t it?” Then back to Halven, voice softer: “Tell me what haunting you’ve seen come out of a sealed letter, Warden, and I’ll stop making a scene.”

*Agent reasoning: I don’t want them yanking the warded sheet and triggering it; better to control the removal, keep them talking, and use the courier as a wedge. I’ll de-escalate just enough to avoid being bound while fishing for why Halven’s so afraid of “chosen readers.”*

### Turn 19 [GAME]

You snap the reliquary lamp shut. The sickly leak of light dies instantly, and the night’s normal bruise-violet returns. The stuttering shadows steady.

Halven exhales through his nose—relief he won’t admit to. Senn’s shoulders drop a fraction, though the cord stays ready in his hand.

You lift both hands. The blank warded sheet rises with them, stark and harmless-looking.

Halven keeps the waxed cloth pinned over the exposed corner at your boot. He doesn’t yank. He leans in just enough to make his authority felt and says, tight and clear: “Slow. Two fingers. No sudden folds.”

He nods once to Senn, who steps closer—not to bind you, but to watch your hands and the boot at the same time. The courier remains where he is, but his weight shifts onto his back foot, like he’s preparing to vanish the moment this turns.

Your question about Lot Thirteen makes the courier’s smile finally crack. He doesn’t answer directly. He says, carefully, “I only carry invitations, Lantern-scribe. Lots are for bidders.”

Halven’s eyes flick to the courier—sharp, accusatory—then back to you. Your softer question hooks him harder than the lamp did.

“A sealed letter came through Larkspur Gate last month,” Halven says. “Funerary gold. Concord-safe on the outside. Inside was a single line—just one—meant for a clerk named Iver.”

His stamp-hand flexes once, involuntarily.

“Iver read it under lanternlight. He laughed—like he’d remembered a joke from childhood. Then his mouth started writing it again. On his own teeth.” Halven’s voice stays level, but his throat works. “We held him down. The words kept trying to finish themselves on anyone who looked too closely. Three acolytes went blind for a week. One still won’t open his mouth in chapel.”

He taps the cloth pinned to your boot-corner. “So no. I don’t break seals that want to be read.”

As he speaks, the air near the gate grows subtly attentive—thin, hungry. Not visible yet, but you feel it: the way lamplight earlier had *called* to something. If this drags on, whatever drifts near curfew inspections will notice the warding and come closer.

Immediate threat: you’re being allowed to extract the hidden sheet, but if you hesitate or it tears, Halven will declare it a hostile ward and Senn will bind you on the spot.

### Turn 20 [PLAYER]

“Two fingers. No folds. Understood.” I crouch slowly, pinch the exposed corner, and ease the warded sheet up and out of my boot in one smooth pull, keeping it flat and well away from your lanternlight.  

I hold it edge-on for Halven to see it’s just a map-margin ward, then offer it to his cloth-covered fingers. “Witnessed, Warden—take it if you must. But tell me: that line meant for Iver… do you remember even a word of it?”  

And without looking away from Halven, I call to the courier, “Don’t drift off—if Lot Thirteen ‘prefers the voice of the one who died with the thumbprint,’ who was that thumbprint?”

*Agent reasoning: Halven’s giving me a narrow opening—if I move carefully I keep my freedom and maybe earn trust. I also want to learn more about Lot Thirteen and the “teeth-writing” haunting, so I’ll comply while talking and keep the courier from slipping away.*

### Turn 21 [GAME]



### Turn 22 [PLAYER]

I crouch slowly and, with two fingers, ease the warded sheet out of my boot in one smooth pull, keeping it flat and angled away from Halven Rook’s lantern. “Witnessed, Warden—shall I place it on the stone for your cloth, or do you want to take it from the edge?”

*Agent reasoning: The scene seems to have reset/blanked; I’ll re-establish where we are by cautiously continuing the last intended action and asking for clarification if needed.*

### Turn 23 [GAME]

The warded sheet slides free in one smooth pull. No tear, no snag—just the soft rasp of paper against leather. The moment it clears your boot, the warding wakes like a held breath: the inked margin-map on it darkens a shade, and the air around its edges feels slightly colder, as if the sheet is insisting on its own boundaries.

Halven doesn’t reach with bare fingers. He keeps the waxed cloth between himself and the paper and answers immediately, clipped: “Stone. Flat. Don’t let it kiss my lantern.”

Senn shifts to your left to block any line-of-sight from the gate road, cord still looped in his hand but lowered. The Grave‑Gild courier takes one careful step back, eyes fixed on the sheet like it might suddenly read him.

You lay the paper on the damp stone path. Moisture beads around it but doesn’t soak in; the warding sheds the wet like oil. Halven lowers his cloth-covered palm and pins one corner—firm, controlled—then slides the cloth under the edge with the practiced motion of someone who’s confiscated dangerous pages before. He does *not* lift it fully yet. He tests it, as if listening for a reaction.

Nothing screams. No flare of light. Just a faint, dry whisper—like turning a page in an empty room.

Halven nods once. “Good. That’s a map-ward. Not a letter-ward.”

Then, from beyond Larkspur Gate, a sound threads in: the soft scrape of something moving over carved names—like fingernails over epitaphs. It’s distant, but it’s coming closer, drawn not by your lamp now, but by the *exposed warding* on the stone.

Senn hears it too. His head snaps toward the gate, and he murmurs, “Warden… something’s paging.”

Halven’s eyes stay on the sheet as his posture tightens. “We’re done lingering,” he says, and finally lifts the paper—still through the cloth—bringing it up to chest height, away from the ground.

Threat, clear and present: an epitaph-spirit (or several) is approaching the gate, attracted by the warded page being out in the open. If it reaches you before this ends, it will try to “read” whatever it can—paper, breath, or skin.

```json
{"inventory_add":[],"inventory_remove":["Warded sheet with map-margin (partly pinned at boot; not secured)"],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":[],"npcs_add":[]}
```

### Turn 24 [PLAYER]

I glance toward the gate, listening hard, then back to Halven. “If it’s paging, don’t carry that sheet bare in the open—wrap it in the cloth and tuck it against your lantern’s backplate; keep its edges from ‘calling.’”

I edge closer to the gate stones without crossing the threshold, palm hovering over my reliquary lamp. “Senn—do you have grave-salt or a name-iron nail? I can scribe a quick hush-ring on the path if you’ll lend me a pinch.”

Then, quietly to Halven: “If you’ve seen letters make teeth write, Warden… who taught you to spot a seal that ‘chooses a reader’?” I cut my eyes to the courier. “And you—stay where I can see you. What exactly is Lot Thirteen buying that needs an invitation carried like a funeral?”

*Agent reasoning: A spirit is approaching and Halven is ending the standoff; I want to both investigate what’s “paging” and keep everyone from getting read. I’ll offer a practical warding step, ask a pointed question, and try to keep the courier from slipping away.*

### Turn 25 [GAME]



### Turn 26 [PLAYER]

I angle my body toward the gate and listen, then nod sharply at Halven. “Wrap the sheet fully in that cloth—no edges showing—and hold it against your lantern’s backplate; don’t let it ‘call’ on the air.”  

I step to the gate stones without crossing, my hand hovering over my reliquary lamp. “Senn—grave-salt? a name-iron nail? Lend me a pinch and I’ll scribe a hush-ring on the path.”  

Then I lower my voice to Halven, eyes flicking between him and the courier. “Who taught you to spot a seal that *chooses a reader*, Warden—and what is Lot Thirteen buying that needs an invitation carried like a funeral?”

*Agent reasoning: Something is “paging” from beyond the gate, drawn to the exposed warding; I want to reduce the paper’s call, set a quick ward, and interrogate both Halven and the courier while they’re pressured and more likely to slip.*

### Turn 27 [GAME]

Halven takes your warning like an order he wishes he’d given first. He folds the waxed cloth over the warded sheet twice—tight, corners tucked—until no paper-edge shows. Then he turns his lantern slightly and presses the wrapped bundle against the lantern’s backplate where the metal is coolest, cinching it there with his forearm.

The scraping beyond Larkspur Gate dulls immediately, as if whatever was coming has lost the thread. It doesn’t stop—just becomes uncertain, circling.

You step up to the gate stones, still on the city side. The threshold’s old ward-line—salt and candle soot ground into the mortar—prickles faintly in your teeth as you near it.

Senn blinks at your request, then fumbles at his belt pouch. “Grave-salt, yes—name-iron, no.” He pours a pinch into his palm and holds it out without stepping past Halven. The salt is gray, gritty, and threaded with tiny black flecks like peppered ash.

As you take it, the courier shifts—one foot edging sideways, measuring distance to the road. Halven’s head snaps up. “Don’t,” he says, and the lantern’s light hardens on the courier’s chest like a bar.

You lower your voice. Halven answers yours without looking away from the gate.

“Who taught me?” He taps two fingers against the lantern’s rim. “Restricted stacks. Before the Concord decided certain lessons were ‘unhealthy.’ A dead mentor, if you want poetry.”

At “dead,” the courier’s throat works. He keeps his hands visible, but his eyes flick to the invitation seal at his own belt like it’s burning.

“And Lot Thirteen?” Halven’s mouth tightens. “An ‘Atlas-leaf,’ they say. Authenticated by candlelight.” He gives the courier a hard glance. “Which is a polite way of saying: *they want a page that reacts to a particular flame.*”

The courier finally speaks, voice thin. “It’s not— it’s just paper. The Syndicate wants buyers who can pay for quiet.”

From the necropolis side, the scraping becomes clearer again—now joined by a wet inhaling sound, like someone trying to breathe through soil. A pale shape drifts between headstones inside the gate: a loose column of cemetery mist threaded with faint letterforms. It pauses at the ward-line, then leans, as if sniffing for the “call” you just muffled.

You have grave-salt in hand, a spirit testing the threshold, and Halven carrying your warded sheet wrapped against his lantern.

```json
{"inventory_add":["Pinch of grave-salt"],"inventory_remove":[],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":[],"npcs_add":[]}
```

### Turn 28 [PLAYER]

I kneel at the city-side edge of the ward-line and sprinkle the grave-salt in a thin crescent, then trace a quick hush-ring sigil with two fingers on the stone. Without looking up, I murmur toward the mist, “No pages for you tonight—tell me what name you’re sniffing for, and I’ll leave a proper epitaph instead.”

I glance up sharply at the courier. “Hands off that seal. If your ‘particular flame’ is what it wants, say whose funeral-light you’re carrying—now.”

*Agent reasoning: The spirit is testing the threshold; I want to reinforce the ward-line with the grave-salt and learn what it’s “reading” while keeping the courier from bolting.*

### Turn 29 [GAME]

The grave-salt falls in a thin crescent along the city-side edge of the ward-line. Where each grain lands, the damp stone dries in pinprick spots, as if the salt is drinking the night. When you drag two fingers through it, tracing the hush-ring, the grit bites your skin—then warms, leaving a faint, chalky sigil that *doesn’t* glow so much as refuse to be ignored.

The effect is immediate and plain: the scraping on the necropolis side drops to a muffled, frustrated rub, like a quill pressed against closed wax. The pale mist-column at the threshold leans in—then stops short as if it’s met a pane of glass. Letterforms in its body shiver and try to align into words, but the hush-ring keeps them from “catching” in the air.

Your murmur draws it anyway. The mist compresses, tightens, and a voice comes through like damp paper forced to speak:

“Q—Quill… whisper…” It mispronounces, tasting the syllables. “LAMP… BACKPLATE… CLOTH… WRONG.”

It isn’t sniffing for a *tomb* name. It’s sniffing for *yours*—and for the warded sheet Halven wrapped away.

Behind you, Halven shifts his stance to put himself between the gate and you, lantern angled low. “Moth,” he says quietly, using the monastery-name like a warning. “It’s keyed to you.”

At your sharp look and command, the courier’s hands freeze mid-hover near his belt. Then—too late to pretend—he swallows and answers.

“Vellumwake,” he says. “Funeral-light from Vellumwake Row. The Syndicate keeps a wick from there for ‘authentication.’ Lot Thirteen wants proof the leaf *answers* to that flame.”

As he says it, the invitation seal at his belt gives a tiny, involuntary *click*, like a locket snapping open by itself. A hairline seam appears in the funerary gold wax—no one touched it, but it’s reacting to the word and the nearby lanternlight.

The mist at the threshold jerks toward that sound. It can’t cross your hush-ring, but it stretches, thinning into a long, reaching tongue of fog threaded with script, probing for any gap in the ward-line.

Threat is now specific: if the invitation seal opens fully, whatever is “bound” to that funerary gold will have a line to pull on—possibly enough to drag the spirit’s attention past the ward and onto you on the city side.

### Turn 30 [PLAYER]

“Halven—smother that lantern for a breath, just enough to starve the seal’s appetite, and keep the wrapped sheet pinned cold.”

I snatch a thicker pinch of the grave-salt and flick it in a tight circle around the courier’s boots, then point two fingers at his belt. “Don’t you touch it. Kneel—slowly—and turn the seal outward where I can see it.”

Without taking my eyes off the seam in the wax, I speak to the mist through the hush-ring. “You’ve got my monastery-name in your mouth—who wrote it there? Give me the scribe’s name, and I’ll trade you a clean epitaph to chew instead of my breath.”

*Agent reasoning: The seal is reacting and could become a conduit; I want to stop it opening, learn what the spirit wants from “Quillwhisper,” and use my lamp/wards to reinforce the threshold while questioning everyone.*

### Turn 31 [GAME]

Halven doesn’t argue. He hooks a thumb over his lantern’s shutter and clamps it down hard.

For one breath the light dies to a bruised ember-glow, and the air near the courier’s belt *relaxes*—that hairline seam in the funerary-gold wax stops widening. The tiny click you heard doesn’t repeat. Halven keeps the cloth-wrapped sheet pinned tight to the lantern’s backplate with his forearm, pressing it to the metal like he’s cooling a fever.

Your thicker pinch of grave-salt snaps out in a tight circle around the courier’s boots. The grains strike wet cobble and bite in; the ring takes. The courier flinches as if the salt stung his ankles through leather. When he tries to shift his foot back, it drags—like the sole is briefly tacky to the stone. He can still move, but not quickly, and not without making it obvious.

“Don’t—” he starts.

“Kneel,” Halven growls, voice low and dangerous in the dim.

The courier obeys, slow. He lowers one knee, then the other, hands held away from his belt. He turns his hip so the seal faces you. In the near-dark you can see the wax clearly: funerary gold with a thumbprint impressed deep, and now that thin seam running from the edge toward the center like a cracked lip. The seam *breathes* once—tightens—then stills again, starved by the smothered lantern.

Your words to the mist land like a hook.

The pale column at the ward-line compresses, letterforms in it shuddering into alignment despite the hush-ring’s pressure. Its “voice” comes through in broken fragments, forced and wet:

“HALVEN… ROOK… WROTE—” it rasps, then the sound tears, as if the hush-ring is shredding the sentence. The mist recoils a handspan, then surges back to the ward-line and tries again, more desperate.

“NOT ROOK. NOT ROOK. THREAD-SCRIBE. STITCHED-MOUTH.”

As it says *stitched-mouth*, a line of script appears across the mist like a pulled seam—briefly forming the image you saw in the puddle: vellum-face, mouth sewn shut with hair-thin writing. The mist’s attention is fixed between you and the seal now, hunting a “line” to follow.

Threat, clear and immediate: if Halven reopens the lantern too soon, the invitation seal is likely to open further—and whatever is bound to that funerary gold will have enough purchase to draw the epitaph-spirit’s reach around your hush-ring via the courier, turning the city-side threshold into a contested space.

### Turn 32 [PLAYER]

I keep my body between the courier and the ward-line and hiss to Halven, “Keep it smothered—no heroics. If we need light, give me a sliver through your fingers, not a full breath.”

I lean in close to the courier’s belt without touching it, and slide a thin strip of warded paper from my satchel to hover like a shield between the seal and open air. “Courier—tell me exactly what the thumbprint is. Whose thumb. Whose funeral.”

Then, to the mist, I press two salt-gritty fingers to the hush-ring and speak carefully: “Thread-Scribe, stitched-mouth—give me a name I can write. One true name, and I’ll set an epitaph on clean paper and push it under the gate for you to eat. Refuse, and you get only silence and salt.”

*Agent reasoning: The seal reacts to light and the spirit is trying to follow a “thread”; I want to keep the lantern smothered, interrogate the mist for the Thread-Scribe identity, and physically/ritually contain the seal before it opens.*

### Turn 33 [GAME]

Halven answers with action, not reassurance. He keeps the lantern shuttered and cups his free hand over the seams, leaving only a thin, accidental bleed of emberlight between two knuckles—barely enough to give edges to things. The wrapped sheet stays pinned to the lantern’s cold backplate, his forearm locked like a brace.

You slide a narrow strip of warded paper from your satchel and hold it between the seal and the open air. The paper doesn’t flare or smoke; instead, the seam in the funerary-gold wax stops its subtle “breathing” entirely, as if the warded strip has flattened the seal’s appetite. The courier’s belt stops twitching.

The courier swallows hard, eyes flicking from your fingers to the salt circle at his knees. “Thumbprint’s… not mine.” His voice drops. “It’s the Master of Wakes’ mark. Grave-Gild. The one who signs the quiet-bills.” He hesitates, then forces it out. “Funeral was—officially—Brother Caldris.” He looks up at Halven like expecting a strike. “Monastery man. Died on paper. Didn’t die in the ground.”

At the ward-line, the mist recoils as your salt-gritty fingers press into the hush-ring. The sigil holds, but it strains: the crescent of grave-salt dulls from gray to a wet, used dark where your touch anchors it.

When you offer the trade—name for epitaph—the mist compresses into something almost human-shaped. Script crawls along its surface, trying to assemble a single line that can survive the hush.

It manages three words, each one a wet tear:

“CALDRIS—” (the sound sticks, like it’s swallowing a pin)
“WROTE—”
“ME.”

Then it spasms, and the “face” in it flashes again: vellum skin, mouth stitched shut, the stitches moving like living cursive.

A new sound joins the scraping behind it: a soft, rapid *tap-tap-tap* from deeper in the necropolis corridors, like fingernails on stone—coming closer, triangulating the gate by your lantern’s buried ember.

Threat, explicit: something else is approaching from inside the necropolis—faster than the mist—drawn by the same keyed attention (your monastery-name, the seal, or the lamp). If it reaches the ward-line while the seal is still cracked, it may use the courier as a handle to pull on the city side.

### Turn 34 [PLAYER]

I jerk my chin at Halven. “Back us up—three steps, slow. Keep the lantern smothered and the wrapped sheet cold; don’t give that tapping a bead to follow.”

I tug my satchel open and, without breaking the warded-paper “shield,” scribble fast on a fresh slip: **CALDRIS WROTE ME; I AM HIS STITCHED MOUTH; I REST WHERE INK CANNOT BREATHE.** Then I fold it tight into a small epitaph packet, salt its crease, and slide it under the gate’s lowest gap with two fingers. “There—eat that. Stay at the line and leave my name alone.”

To the courier, still kneeling: “Unbuckle the belt—slowly—and set it on the ground inside your salt circle. Then lace your fingers behind your head. If that seal cracks again, I’ll drown it in salt and you with it.”

*Agent reasoning: The approaching tapping means we’re about to be flanked by something worse; I need to stabilize the seal and buy time by feeding the mist an epitaph, while also shifting us away from the gate’s “line.” I’m curious about Caldris and Thread-Scribe, but survival first—then questions.*

### Turn 35 [GAME]



### Turn 36 [PLAYER]

I signal Halven to back up three slow steps with the lantern still smothered, the wrapped sheet kept pinned cold against the backplate. Without dropping my warded-paper “shield,” I scribble an epitaph slip—“CALDRIS WROTE ME; I AM HIS STITCHED MOUTH; I REST WHERE INK CANNOT BREATHE.”—fold it tight, salt the crease, and slide it under the gate.  

Then I keep my eyes on the courier’s belt and order, “Unbuckle it slowly and set it on the ground inside the salt ring—hands nowhere near the wax—then lace your fingers behind your head.”

*Agent reasoning: The threat’s escalating with that tapping; I want to reduce light/attention, feed the mist an epitaph to distract it, and secure the cracked seal by isolating it from the courier’s body.*

### Turn 37 [GAME]

Halven follows your chin-jerk immediately. Three slow steps back, heel-to-toe, keeping the lantern’s shutter clenched and his palm cupped over its seams. The ember-bleed between his fingers thins further until it’s barely a bruise on the metal. The cloth-wrapped sheet stays pinned to the lantern’s backplate; you can hear the faintest tick as it cools against the brass.

You keep the warded-paper strip hovering in front of the courier’s belt like a flat, pale blade. With your other hand you scribble the epitaph fast—ink biting cleanly into the slip—fold it tight, salt the crease. When you slide it under the gate’s lowest gap, the paper catches for a heartbeat on rough iron… then slips through.

Inside the necropolis, the mist at the ward-line lunges—not across, but *down* toward the gap. It compresses, then pours itself along the stone like spilled breath. The folded packet vanishes into it.

A sound like dry lips smacking follows. Then the mist swells, as if swallowing. The stitched-face flickers once, clearer than before—vellum skin, the mouth-seam tugging—then the whole column *thins* and pulls back from the ward-line by a handspan. The pressure against your hush-ring eases. It doesn’t leave, but it stops straining forward.

Your warning—*leave my name alone*—gets an answer, scraped and small from the retreating fog:

“NO NAME. ONLY LINE.”

The tapping from deeper inside changes: it pauses, then resumes closer, now with a second rhythm under it—like something dragging a chain or a pen-case on stone.

The courier obeys your order, trembling. “Slow. Slow—” he whispers to himself. He keeps his hands high and away from the wax as if it’s hot. With two fingers he hooks the belt buckle and works it loose in tiny increments.

As the belt slackens, the funerary-gold seal gives a faint *creak*—not cracking, but flexing, like wax warming near a hearth. The hairline seam you’d stopped tries to reopen.

Your warded-paper “shield” catches it: the seam halts mid-flex, held in check, but you can tell it *wants* air.

He sets the belt down inside the salt circle, careful as placing a sleeping snake. Then he interlaces his fingers behind his head and freezes, eyes wide.

Threat, immediate and concrete: something on the necropolis side is now within a few paces of the gate—close enough that the tapping is loud and directional. If the lantern opens or the belt-seal gets exposed to open air again, whatever’s approaching may use that as a target to strike through the ward-line, and the courier’s belt on the ground is now the most obvious “handle.”

### Turn 38 [PLAYER]

I flick more grave-salt to thicken the courier’s ring, then drag a second, narrower salt circle around the belt itself, sealing it off like a little island. “Halven—keep that lantern choked. If it twitches, tell me before it does.”

I hook the edge of my warded-paper under the belt strap (never touching wax) and inch-drag the belt a half-step farther from the gate, then slap a second ward-slip over the buckle like a bandage. 

Toward the necropolis, I lower my voice. “Tapper with the chain—are you the one that stitched Caldris, or are you hunting his line? Show me what you are without crossing, and I’ll answer in ink, not flame.”

*Agent reasoning: The seal is a dangerous handle and something is close; I want to secure the belt and learn what’s approaching without giving it light. I’ll reinforce wards, move the belt away from the gate, and try to “listen”/parley with the tapper while keeping Halven dark.*

### Turn 39 [GAME]



### Turn 40 [PLAYER]

I flick more grave-salt to thicken the ring around the courier, then draw a second tight salt circle around the belt itself like a little island. “Halven—keep that lantern choked; if it so much as twitches, warn me.”

Keeping my fingers off the wax, I hook my warded-paper under the belt strap and inch-drag it a half-step farther from the gate, then press a fresh ward-slip over the buckle like a bandage. Toward the necropolis, I call softly, “Tapper with the chain—did you stitch Caldris, or are you hunting his line? Show yourself without crossing, and I’ll answer in ink, not flame.”

*Agent reasoning: The tapper is close and the belt-seal is a tempting handle; I want to secure it with extra salt and wards, keep Halven’s lantern fully smothered, and try to coax information from whatever’s approaching without letting it cross.*

### Turn 41 [GAME]



### Turn 42 [PLAYER]

I thicken the courier’s salt ring, then draw a second tight circle around the belt like an island. “Halven—lantern choked. If it even *twitches*, tell me.”

Without touching the wax, I hook my warded-paper under the belt strap and inch-drag it a half-step farther from the gate, then press a fresh ward-slip over the buckle. Toward the tapping, I murmur, “Chain-tapper—did you stitch Caldris, or are you hunting his line? Show yourself without crossing, and I’ll answer in ink, not flame.”

*Agent reasoning: The gate-side threat is close; I want to reduce “handles” it can grab (the belt/seal) and learn what’s approaching without giving it light. Salt/wards buy time, then I try to parley to identify it.*

### Turn 43 [GAME]

The grave-salt bites the wet stone with a crisp, pale edge. The courier’s ring thickens into a chalky berm; his boots stop trembling once he realizes the line is *there*. The second, tighter circle around the belt takes—salt grains skitter, then settle as if tugged into place by an unseen seam. For a moment, the funerary-gold wax quiets, its hairline flex arrested.

Halven keeps his lantern choked, shoulders rigid. He doesn’t answer your warning with words—just a sharp nod, eyes fixed on the shutter like he’s listening for a heartbeat inside it.

You slide the warded sheet under the belt strap. The leather drags with a damp squeal. As you inch it a half-step farther from the gate, the air *catches*—a brief suction toward the necropolis side, like the ward-line noticing something moved. The belt crosses your new salt “island” boundary by a finger’s width… and the wax responds immediately: the seal creaks and lifts a fraction, as if trying to inhale.

When you slap the fresh ward-slip over the buckle, the paper adheres with a soft, papery *click*. The wax’s flex stops mid-rise. A thin line of heat crawls across the ward-slip—ink on the paper darkens along a single stroke, writing itself into a tiny, involuntary dash, then going still.

From the necropolis side, the tapping halts.

A chain scrapes once, slow and deliberate, and a shape resolves just beyond the ward-line: not a full figure, but an arrangement of parts the mist is willing to outline. A hand first—bone-white, ink-stained fingertips—holding a length of fine chain with a brass nib tied to it like a pendulum. Behind it, a hooded head is suggested by drifting moth-ash; where a face should be, there’s only layered paper, edges fluttering.

It does not cross. It leans close enough that the ward-line bows inward like glass under pressure.

The thing answers your question by *demonstration*: the brass nib on the chain taps the stone—once, twice—and each tap leaves a brief, wet-black mark that immediately tries to become a letter. The ward-line rejects the writing; the marks smear into illegible hooks and evaporate.

A voice follows, dry as a page turned too fast. “CALDRIS IS A MARGIN. I DO NOT STITCH MARGINS.”

The chain lifts. The nib points—not at you, but at the belt inside the salt island.

“HIS LINE HIDES IN GOLD. LET ME READ IT.”

Behind you, the courier chokes on a sound and goes very still, as if afraid even breath will count as permission.

### Turn 44 [PLAYER]

I keep my warded-paper shield between the gate and the belt and shake my head once. “No. You don’t get to *read* through my circles.”

I tilt my reliquary lamp a hair toward the ward-slip on the buckle—still shuttered—and speak to the paper-faced thing. “Name yourself, Reader. What do you call a ‘margin,’ and what happens when you find one?” Then, to the courier without looking back: “Don’t move. Halven—if the lantern pulses, say so.”

I pinch a fresh slip, wet the tip with my tongue, and sketch a quick decoy sigil—just enough gold-shape mimicry in ink—then hold it up at the ward-line. “You can read this instead. Tell me what you see in it, and we’ll talk about the real gold.”

*Agent reasoning: The chain-nib thing might be a reader rather than an attacker, but it’s fixating on the belt-seal—dangerous. I want more information and a controlled test without giving it access or permission, and I also want to interrogate it about “margin” and Caldris while keeping Halven and the courier steady.*

### Turn 45 [GAME]



### Turn 46 [PLAYER]

I keep my warded-paper shield between the gate and the belt and shake my head once. “No. You don’t get to read through my circles.”  

I tilt my reliquary lamp a hair toward the ward-slip on the buckle—still shuttered—and address the paper-faced thing: “Name yourself, Reader. What do you call a ‘margin,’ and what happens when you find one?” Then, without looking back: “Courier—don’t move. Halven—if the lantern pulses, say so.”  

I wet a fresh slip with my tongue, sketch a quick decoy sigil with a hint of gold-shape mimicry, and hold it up at the ward-line. “Read this instead. Tell me what you see in it, and we’ll talk about the real gold.”

*Agent reasoning: The paper-faced “Reader” wants the belt’s gold seal; I should deny access, learn its rules and name, and test it with a decoy reading to buy time and gather info while Halven keeps the lantern shut.*

### Turn 47 [GAME]



### Turn 48 [PLAYER]

I plant my warded-paper like a little shield between the gate and the belt and give the ward-line a sharp look. “No reading through my circles.”  

I angle my shuttered reliquary lamp a hair toward the ward-slip on the buckle. “Name yourself, Reader—what do you mean by ‘margin,’ and what happens when you find one?” Then, over my shoulder: “Courier, don’t move. Halven—if the lantern so much as pulses, say it.”  

I wet a fresh slip, sketch a quick decoy sigil with a faint gold-shape mimic, and hold it just shy of the ward-line. “Read this instead. Tell me what you see, and we’ll talk about the real gold.”

*Agent reasoning: Nothing new appeared—so I’ll prompt the scene by reasserting boundaries, question the chain-tapper’s identity, and offer a decoy to learn its motives without risking the belt.*

### Turn 49 [GAME]



### Turn 50 [PLAYER]

I keep the warded-paper braced like a shield and don’t let my eyes leave the ward-line. “No reading through my circles.”

I angle my shuttered reliquary lamp slightly toward the ward-slip on the buckle. “Name yourself, Reader. When you say ‘margin,’ what are you calling Caldris—someone spared, someone excluded, or a note that won’t stay put? And what do you *do* when you find one?”

Over my shoulder, low and firm: “Courier, don’t move. Halven—if the lantern even pulses, say it.”

I wet a fresh slip, sketch a quick decoy sigil with a faint gold-shape mimic, and hold it just shy of the ward-line. “Read this instead. Tell me what you see in *this* ink, and then we’ll discuss the real gold.”

*Agent reasoning: The Reader wants access to the belt’s gold seal; I’ll probe its identity and motives while offering a decoy to learn how it “reads,” and keep everyone still in case the lantern reacts.*

### Turn 51 [GAME]

Your decoy slip catches the necropolis air and stiffens as the warding circles drink the spit-wet ink. The faint gold-shape mimic you sketched doesn’t glow—at first. Then it *sheens* like funeral gilt under candlelight, a convincing lie.

Between the gate stones, the puddled shadow you’d called “Reader” gathers itself into a face again: vellum-pale, mouth stitched shut with thread-thin script. The stitches twitch as if trying to pronounce your question anyway.

It doesn’t speak aloud.

Instead, the ward-line on the gate answers for it—thin, black lettering crawling along the seam where stone meets iron:

**MARGIN: WHAT IS LEFT WHEN THE PAGE IS CUT.  
CALDRIS: A NAME REMOVED TO FIT THE BINDING.**

As the text finishes, your decoy sigil *pulls*—not toward the gate, but toward the stitched face, like a hook catching cloth. The paper in your hand tugs forward half an inch. The “Reader” leans, and the stitched script across its mouth loosens by one thread, a single filament lifting into the air like a feeler.

Halven Rook’s voice snaps tight behind you. “Lamp’s steady—no pulse.”

The courier obeys your order in the worst way: he goes perfectly still, but his gloved hand slowly opens, letting the gold-sealed invitation slip from his fingers. It lands near the ward-line with a soft *tck*—and the funerary wax thumbprint flashes, briefly wet-looking, as if freshly pressed.

The ward-line reacts to the gold mimicry on your decoy. A hairline crack of light runs along the buckle’s ward-slip—your own belt ward answering the gate’s ward like two notes finding harmony. The “Reader” takes advantage of the resonance: that lifted stitch-thread darts toward your decoy slip, aiming to *sew* itself into your drawn sigil.

Threat, clear and immediate: if that thread anchors, it will “read” through your decoy—then use the resonance to bridge into the warding on your person.

The crawling gate-text adds one more line, faster, less controlled:

**WHEN I FIND A MARGIN, I RESTORE THE MISSING LINE.**

### Turn 52 [PLAYER]

I snap the decoy slip down and tear it clean in half, then crumple both pieces into a tight ball and shove them into my satchel’s warded pocket. “No anchor for you.”

With my boot, I scuff a rough line through the belt’s outer salt circle to break the harmony, then nudge the dropped invitation farther away from the ward-line with the edge of my warded paper—careful not to touch the wax. “Courier—hands up where I can see them. Halven, keep watching that lamp.”

I lean toward the gate and speak softly, almost conversational. “Restore the missing line how—by writing Caldris back into the world, or by erasing whoever holds his place? And what binding cut his name in the first place?”

*Agent reasoning: That stitch-thread is trying to anchor to my decoy and bridge into my own wards—cut the connection fast, break the “gold” resonance, and gather more info without letting it read me.*

### Turn 53 [GAME]

You tear the decoy slip before the lifted stitch-thread can bite. The filament snaps back mid-lunge and whips the air with a dry, papery *flick*. For a heartbeat the torn halves *try* to pull toward each other—then your satchel’s warded pocket swallows them and the tugging stops. The “Reader” recoils as if you’d slapped its hand.

Your boot scuffs through the outer salt circle on the belt. The hairline light along the ward-slip gutters and dies. Whatever harmony was building between gate-ward and buckle-ward breaks cleanly.

When you nudge the gold-sealed invitation away with the edge of your warded sheet, the wax thumbprint doesn’t smear—but it *warms*. A faint scent of melted beeswax and grave-rose rises, and the paper under the seal curls slightly as if it’s been near flame.

“Hands—up,” you order.

The courier’s hands rise, palms out. His sleeves fall back enough to show mourning-thread tattoos at the wrists: neat tally marks, some crossed through. He doesn’t speak, but his eyes track the invitation like it’s a loaded spring.

Halven keeps his gaze on your lamp and the gate seam. “Still steady,” he says. Then, lower: “But the ward-line’s rewriting.”

Because it is. Your soft questions don’t get spoken answers; they get *edits*.

The stitched face leans closer to the gate seam, and the black crawling text there rearranges itself, letters scuttling like beetles:

**RESTORE: RETURN THE CUT NAME TO ITS ORIGINAL PLACE.  
THE PLACE IS OCCUPIED.  
BINDING: CONCORD LAMPSKIN. WICK-OIL. VOW-THREAD.**

As that last line forms, the reliquary lamp in your hand doesn’t pulse—but its shutter seams sweat a thin line of warm oil-scent, unmistakably the Concord’s recipe. The “Reader” reacts immediately: the stitches over its mouth tighten, then one stitch unhooks itself and drops—an actual loop of script-thread falling from nothing to the wet stone.

It lands between you and the gate and begins to *crawl* toward your boot, seeking a new anchor now that the paper is denied.

Threat: if that living stitch-thread touches your person or your lamp, it can fasten and “restore” by force—using you as the margin to write through.

The courier, hands still raised, finally speaks in a thin voice: “Lot Thirteen is… Atlas-leaf by candlelight. They’ll pay to see that lamp sweat.”

### Turn 54 [PLAYER]

I hop my boot back and drop to a knee, pinning the crawling stitch-thread to the wet stone with the edge of my warded-paper like a bookknife. “Halven—steady on the lamp. Courier—Lot Thirteen: who *exactly* are they buying for?”

Without lifting the paper, I uncap my ink and blot a tight “closed eye” ward right over the thread, then slide the whole pinned mess into an empty glass vial from my satchel and cork it fast. I glance at the gate seam. “If the place is occupied, tell me the occupant’s name—unless you’ve cut that too.”

*Agent reasoning: The crawling stitch-thread is the immediate danger; I need to stop it without letting it anchor to me or the lamp. I also want to exploit what it revealed—Concord lampskin/vow-thread—and press the courier about Lot Thirteen while keeping Halven watching the lamp.*

### Turn 55 [GAME]

You hop back in time. The stitch-thread lunges for where your boot *was* and hits only wet stone, skittering sideways in a frustrated curl.

Dropping to a knee, you bring the warded-paper down like a bookknife. The edge catches the thread hard enough to make a tiny squeal—more felt in your teeth than heard. It tries to flatten, to slip out from under the paper, but your weight and the warding hold it in place.

Halven’s reply is immediate, controlled. “Lamp steady. No pulse.” He shifts his stance, putting himself between you and the open path behind—watching both the gate seam and the courier.

The courier swallows, hands still up. “Buying for… a table, not a person. Grave-Gild calls it the **Ashen Bench**. Three seats. One’s always empty.” His eyes flick to the invitation you shoved away. “They don’t bid—people bid *to be seen by them*.”

You uncap your ink. The moment the nib nears the pinned stitch-thread, the thread thrashes, trying to jerk free—like a worm sensing salt. Your “closed eye” ward lands cleanly over it anyway: a tight oval with a barbed lid-line. The ward drinks the motion. The thread goes slack, then stiff, as if it’s suddenly forgotten how to be a sentence.

Sliding the pinned mess into a vial is awkward but it works: you tilt the paper, guide the immobilized thread inside, and cork it fast. The vial gives a single, sharp *tick* from within—then silence. The glass fogs for a second with a breathy film of tiny letters that immediately smear into nothing.

At the gate seam, your question about the occupant makes the crawling text hesitate—then *scribble over itself* in a messy correction. New words force their way through:

**OCCUPANT: ELDRA QUILLWHISPER.**

The letters deepen, as if pressed with a heavier hand. Then an addendum appears, smaller, meaner:

**(UNFINISHED.)**

Consequence hits right after: your reliquary lamp’s shutter seams ooze one slow tear of warm wick-oil down the side—more than scent this time, a visible bead. The bead doesn’t fall; it *clings*, trembling, as if waiting for permission.

Halven’s voice tightens. “Moth. That’s… not how wards label people.”

The gate’s ward-line continues to rewrite, and the iron at its edge gives a faint, stressed creak—as if something on the other side has noticed the name it’s being offered.

I swipe my thumb across the lamp’s oily bead and smear it onto a blank ward-slip, then fold the slip shut twice and tuck it into my satchel—out of the gate’s sight. “No consent.”

I step in close enough to glare at the crawling seam-text and draw a quick correction mark in the air with my inked finger—an editor’s hook. “False colophon. If you want a name, use mine properly: Eldra ‘Moth’ Quillwhisper, lantern-scribe—*not* your occupant.”  

Then I glance sharply at the courier. “Ashen Bench—who sits the other two seats, and what does the empty one *want*?”

*Agent reasoning: The gate just tried to name me as the “occupant,” which feels like a binding trick; I want to interrupt the inscription, learn what “unfinished” means, and keep the lamp from being used as a key while also squeezing the courier for details on the Ashen Bench.*

I cut my eyes to the courier. “Ashen Bench—who fills the other two seats, and what does the empty one want?”

Then I snap my gaze to the courier. “Ashen Bench—who sits the other two seats, and what does the empty one *want*? Names, now.”

Then I fix the courier with a hard stare. “Ashen Bench—who sits the other two seats, and what does the empty one *want*? Names, now.”

*Agent reasoning: There’s no new scene text, so I’ll reassert my last intent in-character: deny the gate any offering, challenge the false “occupant” label, and interrogate the courier about the Ashen Bench’s members and motives—key mystery threads.*

The folded ward-slip drinks the lamp’s oily bead the way blotter takes a secret. Your thumb-ward bites shut with a dry little sting—heatless, but certain. The lamp’s flame doesn’t change, yet the air around your satchel stops “tasting” like wick-oil for a breath, as if you’ve put a lid on a scent.

At the seam of Larkspur Gate, your editor’s hook hangs in the air like a punctuation mark that refuses to fall. The seam-text—thin, hairline script packed into the stone’s join—shivers and tries to reflow around it.

Then it *gives*.

A strip of writing peels up from the seam as if lifted by an invisible knife. Beneath the false colophon, a truer line shows through—older, pressed deep into the granite:

**“CATALOGUE OF OCCUPANTS: [VACANT]”**

The bracketed word isn’t ink. It’s an absence shaped like a word, a place where a name has been scraped out so thoroughly the stone looks *starved*. As you stare, the absence tugs at the back of your throat, trying to make you cough up a syllable you don’t mean to give. The seam answers your demand by *inviting you to fill it*.

Behind you, the Grave-Gild courier flinches as the strip of seam-text lifts. He takes a half-step back, palm raised—an undertaker’s reflex when a corpse sits up. His gold-sealed invitation crinkles in his fist.

“Ashen Bench,” he says quickly, voice low. “Two seats are spoken for: **Warden-Scribe Halven Rook**… and **Acolyte Senn**. Concord eyes. They’re coming to make it look lawful.”

He swallows, gaze flicking to your satchel like he can smell the ward-slip you just buried. “The empty seat—” His mouth works as if the word hurts. “—belongs to **the one the Concord expunged**. Not a person on paper anymore. It wants a name *put back where it was cut out*. It wants a hand to write it—yours, if you’re stupid enough.”

As he says that, the seam’s lifted strip trembles and begins to curl toward your inked finger, seeking contact like a hungry bookmark.

```json

### Turn 64 [PLAYER]

I jerk my inked finger back and slap a clean ward-slip between my hand and the curling strip, whispering, “No autographs,” as I press it flat to pin the hungry text against the stone.  

Without looking away from the [VACANT], I ask Halven under my breath, “Warden-Scribe—since when are you ‘spoken for’ by Grave-Gild, and who is Acolyte Senn to you?”  

Then, to the courier: “The Concord expunged *which* name—tell me what you remember: first letter, cadence, anything. And what happens if the vacancy stays vacant?”

*Agent reasoning: The seam is trying to trick me into supplying a name; I want to learn about the expunged one without feeding it, and I’m curious why Halven’s name is on that bench. I should physically block the “bookmark” strip, contain it if possible, and interrogate both Halven and the courier for details.*

### Turn 65 [GAME]

Your clean ward-slip hits the curling strip with a papery *thwack*. The lifted seam-text spasms like a hooked fish—then pins flat, trapped under the ward. The stone beneath frosts over in a thin rime where the slip touches, and the strip’s frantic curling slows to a resentful tremble.

But the bracketed absence—**[VACANT]**—doesn’t pin. It *stares back* as a hole in the sentence. Your throat tightens again, testing whether you’ll volunteer a syllable.

Halven Rook is already there—close enough that his breath fogs faintly in the cold seep off the gate. He doesn’t look at the courier; he looks at your satchel and the ward-slip you just spent.

“Spoken for?” he murmurs, and the words are careful, clipped. “I’m not bought. I’m **assigned**. Grave-Gild requested a ‘neutral witness’ for their Vigil-Auction and the Concord agreed—because the alternative is a riot of lamps and forged leaves.” His gaze flicks to the pinned strip. “You’re making that alternative.”

“And Senn,” he says, quieter still, “is my acolyte. My runner. My liability.”

The courier’s eyes keep darting to the **[VACANT]** like it might climb out. He wets his lips, then forces the memory out as if it’s lodged behind his teeth.

“First letter… I remember the *shape* more than the sound,” he whispers. “A tall hook. Like an **L**—or an old **I** with a thorn. The cadence was… three beats. Soft-hard-soft. Like a name you could sing and regret.”

He flinches, suddenly, because the pinned strip *scratches* under your ward-slip—tiny, rapid strokes. Not words. Practice. Like something learning your pressure.

“If it stays vacant,” the courier says, voice thinning, “the vacancy doesn’t stay still. It starts borrowing. It takes names off stones, off ledgers, off throats. People forget who they are supposed to mourn, and the dead get… impatient.”

As he speaks, the seam around **[VACANT]** subtly widens—no more than a hair—but enough that the gate’s join sighs, and a faint, papery rasp leaks out from within, like pages being turned by someone with no hands.

### Turn 66 [PLAYER]

I keep my mouth shut and breathe through my nose, then smear a quick, ugly decoy glyph on the *edge* of the pinned ward-slip—something meaningless, just to give the scratching strip “ink” that isn’t a name.  

I tilt my lamp toward the **[VACANT]** without offering oil. “Halven—what exactly did the Concord expunge, and with what rite? Do you carry the redaction order on you?”  

Then I look to the courier. “Three beats, thorned L/I—was it a title, a person, or a place? And who benefits if it starts borrowing names—Grave-Gild or Concord?”

*Agent reasoning: The vacancy is actively widening and trying to steal names; I want more clues without feeding it my own. Halven and the courier know institutional angles, so I’ll press for specifics while using a decoy mark to distract the hungry seam-text.*

### Turn 67 [GAME]



### Turn 68 [PLAYER]

I keep my lips sealed and breathe through my nose, then smear a quick, ugly decoy glyph along the edge of the pinned ward-slip—ink with no name in it.  

I angle my lamp toward the **[VACANT]** without offering oil. “Halven—what did the Concord expunge, and by what rite? Do you carry the redaction order on you?”  

Then I flick my eyes to the courier. “Three beats, thorned L/I—was it a title, a person, or a place? And who profits if it starts borrowing names—Grave-Gild or Concord?”

*Agent reasoning: The pinned seam-text is still trying to “learn” my hand; I’ll feed it harmless ink while I interrogate Halven and the courier about the expungement and who profits—those details feel like the real trap.*

### Turn 69 [GAME]



### Turn 70 [PLAYER]

I smear a worthless decoy glyph along the ward-slip’s edge to feed the scratching strip “ink” that isn’t a name, then lift my lamp close to the **[VACANT]** and study how the absence is cut into the stone. “Halven Rook—show me the redaction order, or at least tell me the rite used to expunge it.” I glance at the courier. “That thorned L/I—was it a person, a title, or a place, and who stands to gain when the vacancy starts stealing names?”

*Agent reasoning: The scene seems to have stalled; I’ll restate my intent in-character and try a concrete action to prompt a response—physically inspect the gate text and press Halven for the order while keeping the vacancy from coaxing my voice.*

### Turn 71 [GAME]



### Turn 72 [PLAYER]

feels like a trap trying to get me to “fill in” a name; I want to distract the hungry text with meaningless ink, then pry specifics from Halven and the courier—especially the rite and any written order—before it widens further.]
I smear a crude, meaningless decoy glyph along the ward-slip’s edge to feed the scratching strip ink that isn’t a name, then raise my lamp close to the **[VACANT]** to study how the absence was cut into the stone. “Halven Rook—what rite did the Concord use to expunge this, and do you have the redaction order on you?” I cut my eyes to the courier. “That thorned L/I—person, title, or place… and who profits when the vacancy starts stealing names: Grave-Gild or Concord?”

*Agent reasoning: The gate’s [VACANT*

### Turn 73 [GAME]



### Turn 74 [PLAYER]

feels like a baited hook for a name; I want to keep it fed with meaningless ink while forcing Halven and the courier to give concrete details—especially any written redaction order or the rite used—before the absence widens.]
I smear a crude, meaningless decoy glyph along the ward-slip’s edge to keep the scratching strip busy, then lift my lamp close to the **[VACANT]** and study the cut of the absence without giving it oil. “Halven Rook—what rite did the Concord use to expunge this, and do you have the redaction order on you?” I flick my gaze to the courier. “That thorned L/I—person, title, or place? And who profits when the vacancy starts borrowing names: Grave-Gild or Concord?”

*Agent reasoning: The [VACANT*

### Turn 75 [GAME]



### Turn 76 [PLAYER]

I steady my reliquary lamp and keep my tongue pressed to my teeth. “I’m not seeing the room—what does the **[VACANT]** look like up close, and how do Halven and the courier react to my questions and the decoy glyph?”

*Agent reasoning: There’s no new scene text to react to, so I should prompt the world for concrete sensory details and immediate NPC reactions before I accidentally “fill in” the vacancy.*

### Turn 77 [GAME]



### Turn 78 [PLAYER]

I lift the lamp higher and slowly pan its light across the stone around the **[VACANT]**, looking for tool-marks, salt-lines, or any seam where the absence “begins.” “Halven—courier—talk to me: what did my decoy glyph do, and what exactly am I looking at here?”

*Agent reasoning: I don’t have any scene details—only a blank “---” —so I need to re-orient by probing the environment and prompting Halven/courier to respond, while staying careful not to “fill” the vacancy with a name.*

### Turn 79 [GAME]



### Turn 80 [PLAYER]

I keep my tongue pinned behind my teeth and let my lamp-light skim the stone without lingering on the **[VACANT]**. “Halven—courier—describe what you’re seeing, word for word, and tell me what the decoy glyph did.” I crouch and trace the perimeter with the ward-slip, hunting for seams, salt-lines, tool marks, or any place the absence has an edge I can measure without naming it.

*Agent reasoning: The scene text didn’t come through, so I need to re-anchor myself in what’s present; as Moth, I’ll probe the environment carefully and get the NPCs to speak while avoiding supplying any “real” names to the vacancy.*

### Turn 81 [GAME]



### Turn 82 [PLAYER]

I raise the reliquary lamp and make a slow circle of light over the stone *around* the **[VACANT]**, then glance between Halven and the courier. “I need your exact words—what do you see where it isn’t, and what changed when I fed it the decoy glyph?”  

Keeping my mouth shut on any proper nouns, I press the ward-slip to the boundary and drag it a finger’s width along the perimeter, watching for snagging, heat, frost, or ink-bleed. “And if either of you has a written order, seal, or scrap with that thorned L/I—hand it over. No summaries.”

*Agent reasoning: I don’t have any scene text to respond to, so I’ll probe the environment and the NPCs directly while staying careful not to “name” the vacancy; I’ll also try a small, safe test to see how the absence behaves at an edge.*

### Turn 83 [GAME]



### Turn 84 [PLAYER]

I keep the lamp’s light grazing the stone and never center it on the **[VACANT]**. “Halven, courier—say *exactly* what your eyes report, not what you think it means. Start with the edge: is it jagged, soft, smoking, bright, cold?”  

I slide the ward-slip clockwise along the boundary, pausing every handspan to tap the stone and sniff for salt, iron, or ozone; if the slip snags or the ink twitches, I stop and mark that spot with a tiny dot. “And if you’ve got a redaction order or any sealed scrap with that thorned L/I, put it on the ground between us—slowly—so I can read the seal before the vacancy gets hungry.”

*Agent reasoning: The scene didn’t render any details, so I’ll probe the environment and force NPCs to describe what’s happening while continuing my careful, non-naming measurements around the absence; also I’ll try to bait out any physical document they might have.*

### Turn 85 [GAME]

Your lamp makes a careful orbit, light kept to the *stone that still admits light*. The **[VACANT]** refuses the glow the way a hole refuses rain—no shine, no shadow, just a stubborn non-return.

Halven Rook swallows once, then forces his gaze to the edge you indicate. “Edge… looks… *stitched*,” he says, each word clipped as if he’s reading a confiscation list. “Not thread—like the *idea* of thread. Little bites. Saw-tooth but… soft. Cold. My eyes keep trying to slide off it.”

The courier—Grave-Gild coat, funerary-gold pin—keeps his hands visible and his voice low. “I see a clean oval of—” he stops, blinks hard, and corrects himself as if physically yanked. “I see the *stone stop*. Like wax ends at a mold line. It’s brighter right *next* to it, like the lamp’s trying to fill it and can’t.”

“At the decoy glyph,” Halven continues, “it—” he pauses, jaw working. “It *tasted* it. The edge leaned. The lampsmoke—your wick—pulled sideways for a breath. Then it… rejected it. Like spitting out a hair. After that, the boundary got tighter. Less… fray.”

You press the ward-slip to the perimeter and drag it clockwise.

At the first handspan: nothing—paper skates over damp stone.

Second: a faint *snag*, like the slip caught on an invisible burr. The ink on your warding twitch-lines crawls a hair’s breadth toward the **[VACANT]** and then freezes. When you tap the stone there, it answers with a slightly higher, hollower note. The air smells briefly of ozone and old iron—like a struck nail.

You dot the spot.

Third pause: the slip warms, not the stone—your fingers feel heat *through the paper* as if the warding is doing work. A thin line of salt—gritty, deliberate—runs under moss, circling part of the boundary. Not natural seep: poured and brushed.

When you ask for orders or scraps, Halven’s gloved hand goes to his satchel and stops, knuckles whitening. “I have a seal,” he says, and doesn’t move it yet. The courier obeys first: he kneels and sets a small folded document on the ground between you, waxed shut with funerary gold.

The wax bears the thorned L/I—pressed hard enough to crack the gold. As it touches the stone, the **[VACANT]**’s edge subtly *leans* toward it, like a mouth remembering it can open.

### Turn 86 [PLAYER]

I suck in a careful breath and hook the ward-slip under the courier’s sealed document, sliding it a foot back *away* from the **[VACANT]** without touching the wax. “Good. No closer than that—if it leans again, we move it farther.”

I angle the lamp so its light stays on the salt line and the snagged spot, not the hole. “Halven, why won’t you put your seal down? Tell me what the thorned L/I *means*, not what you’ve been told to call it.” I glance to the courier. “And you—who issued this, and what happens if I break it?”

Still crouched, I tap the hollower note again and press the warmed ward-slip briefly to the salt under the moss. “This salt circle—yours, Halven? Or theirs? And what’s anchored at my dotted snag—iron, nail, hinge, or a name someone tried to nail in place?”

*Agent reasoning: The vacancy reacts to the seal like bait; I want to keep it from feeding while learning what the seal is and why Halven hesitates. I’ll ward the document first, then interrogate both about the thorned L/I and the salt circle, and probe that snag point safely.*

### Turn 87 [GAME]



### Turn 88 [PLAYER]

I hook my ward-slip under the sealed document and slide it another two feet away from the **[VACANT]**, watching the edge for any “lean,” then pin the paper down with a small stone. “No one touches the wax yet.”

I keep the lamp trained on the salt under the moss and the dotted snag. “Courier: who issued this order, and what’s the consequence if the seal breaks—curse, summons, or simply notification?” I turn to Halven. “And you—why are you hesitating? Tell me what the thorned L/I *actually* signifies, not the polite name.”

I tap the hollow spot once more, then scrape moss aside with the corner of the ward-slip to expose the salt line. “Whose salt is this, and what’s anchored under my dot—ironwork, a nail, or a written name?”

*Agent reasoning: The seal made the edge “lean,” so I should get it farther from the VACANT and interrogate both men for specifics; the salt line and hollow tap suggest an anchor point worth probing without naming the absence.*

### Turn 89 [GAME]

You slide the sealed document another two feet back. The **[VACANT]** edge *does* lean—just a finger’s-width of motion in the wrong direction, like fabric tugged by a draft—then it stops when the wax crosses an unseen threshold. The air pressure eases. Pinning it with a stone makes the gold wax give a tiny, brittle *tick*… but it doesn’t crack further.

The courier watches the edge, throat bobbing. “Issued by a Grave-Gild notary,” he says, careful as if each syllable is a coin. “Not a street undertaker. A *Vigil* notary—auction-side.” He points but doesn’t approach. “If the seal breaks, it’s not a curse. It’s a *notice*. The wax remembers the first eyes that open it. The notary gets that memory. So does anyone… listening through their ink.”

Halven’s hand stays half in his satchel. He doesn’t look at the document now; he looks at your lamp, then at the salt. “Because mine isn’t funerary gold,” he says. “It’s Concord blackwax. It doesn’t just notify— it *binds*. And this thing—” he flicks two fingers toward the **[VACANT]** without fully pointing, as if afraid to give it a straight line— “is hungry for bindings.”

You scrape moss aside along your dotted segment. The salt line beneath is not a full circle—more like a *stitched arc*, brushed in short, repeated strokes. Mixed in it are tiny dark grains that glitter when the lamp catches them.

Halven exhales through his nose. “Concord salt, cut with lamp-ash. A ward-line. Old.”

Your second tap on the hollower note answers differently now: not just hollow, but *metallic*, as if you struck a thin lid. You press the warmed ward-slip to the exposed salt—its ink shivers, then steadies, as though the warding recognizes the mixture.

At your dotted snag, the stone gives a faint, reluctant *give*. Not collapse—more like a cover shifting a hair. Something small is anchored there, close to the surface.

The courier crouches, squinting. “That’s not a name,” he murmurs. “Names don’t ring.”

Halven finally says what he’s been avoiding. “The thorned L/I isn’t ‘Lot’ or ‘Ledger.’ It’s **Lacuna Imprimatur**—a redaction authority. Permission to make a hole where a record used to be.” He swallows. “And if this is Concord salt… then someone tried to *pin* the lacuna in place with iron.”

As he says “iron,” the lamp’s smoke pulls sideways again—toward your dotted spot—like it’s being breathed in.

### Turn 90 [PLAYER]

I pinch the lamp-wick down until the smoke thins, then shift the lamp so it lights my hands and the salt-arc, not the **[VACANT]**. “No more saying ‘iron’ out loud,” I mutter, then to Halven: “Lacuna Imprimatur—who can grant it, and what’s the price? Don’t give me titles—give me mechanics.”

Keeping my eyes on the stone, I slide two ward-slips under the slightly-giving spot like shims and use my knife-tip to lift the “lid” a hair at a time, listening for that ring. To the courier, quiet: “If the notary gets the first-eye memory, can I blind the memory—smoke, mirror-sheen, or a surrogate gaze from my lamp?”

*Agent reasoning: The metallic “lid” and smoke-draft suggest a physical anchor that’s interacting with the warding; I want to expose it carefully without feeding the VACANT, and I also want to learn more about Lacuna Imprimatur and the notary’s notice.*

### Turn 91 [GAME]



### Turn 92 [PLAYER]

I pinch the lamp-wick down until the smoke thins, angling the light to my hands and the exposed salt-arc, never the **[VACANT]**. “Halven—Lacuna Imprimatur: who can grant it, and what’s the *mechanical* price? What gets paid, what gets taken, what gets bound?”  

Without looking up, I slide two ward-slips under the slightly-giving spot like shims and ease my knife-tip under the edge, lifting the “lid” a hair at a time and pausing whenever it rings. To the courier, very quiet: “That seal takes the first-eye memory—can I blind it with smoke or mirror-sheen, or give it a surrogate gaze through my lamp?”

*Agent reasoning: The “lid” and the warded salt arc feel like a trap-anchor; I want to learn the rules of the Lacuna Imprimatur and safely reveal what’s under the dotted snag without feeding the VACANT. Also, the courier’s seal “remembers first eyes,” so I should ask how to obscure or redirect that memory before opening anything.*

### Turn 93 [GAME]



### Turn 94 [PLAYER]

I pinch the wick down until the smoke thins and keep the lamp’s light on my hands and the exposed salt-arc—never centered on the **[VACANT]**. “Halven—Lacuna Imprimatur: who can grant it, and what’s the *mechanical* price? What gets paid, what gets taken, what gets bound?”

Without looking up, I shim two ward-slips under the slightly-giving spot and ease my knife-tip under the edge, lifting the “lid” a hair at a time and pausing whenever it rings. To the courier, barely a whisper: “That seal steals the first-eye memory—can I blind it with smoke or mirror-sheen, or feed it a surrogate gaze through my lamp instead?”

*Agent reasoning: I need answers about the Lacuna Imprimatur and the seal’s “first-eye” trick, but the anchored lid is an immediate physical clue—so I’ll keep prying carefully while pressing both NPCs for concrete mechanics and a workaround to open the document safely.*

### Turn 95 [GAME]



### Turn 96 [PLAYER]

I pinch the wick down until the smoke thins and keep the lamp’s light tight on my hands and the salt-arc, not the **[VACANT]**. “Halven—Lacuna Imprimatur: who can grant it, and what’s the mechanical price? What exactly gets paid, taken, or bound?”

I slide two ward-slips under the giving edge as shims and use my knife-tip to lift the “lid” a breath at a time, pausing whenever it rings. Without looking up, I whisper to the courier, “Can I blind the seal’s first-eye memory with smoke or a mirror-flash—or can my lamp ‘see’ for me and take the imprint instead?”

*Agent reasoning: The “lid” at the dotted snag is reacting like a hidden iron-capped anchor; I want to open it carefully while extracting details about Lacuna Imprimatur and how to spoof the seal’s “first-eye” memory without triggering the VACANT.*

### Turn 97 [GAME]



### Turn 98 [PLAYER]

I freeze with the knife mid-lift, listening for any change in the air, then murmur, “I’m not getting anything—did something just… skip?”  

I keep the lamp hooded and angled down, and press Halven again: “Mechanics. Who signs a Lacuna Imprimatur, and what does it *consume*—a name, a year, a witness, blood, debt?”  

Then I resume, lifting the lid a hair more with the ward-slips bracing it; with my other hand I tilt a sliver of polished lamp-metal to catch a faint reflection off the seal area—never directly looking—testing if the imprint can be routed into the lamp’s gaze instead of mine.

*Agent reasoning: The scene feed looks blank, so I’ll cautiously continue my careful prying while pressing Halven and the courier for concrete details, and I’ll test the “first-eye memory” idea with a small controlled reflection from my lamp without exposing the VACANT directly.*

### Turn 99 [GAME]



### Turn 100 [PLAYER]

I hold perfectly still, counting three breaths, then sweep the lamp low across the salt-arc to see if any grains have shifted. “Halven—did the Loom stutter, or did *we*?” I ask, and to the courier: “Say one true detail about what you see right now—anything.”

*Agent reasoning: The scene output is blank, so I’ll probe the environment carefully, verify if the “skip” is an in-world effect or missing narration, and keep my cautious, curious approach focused on the lid/seal and Halven/courier for answers.*

### Turn 101 [GAME]

You hold the knife and don’t move. One breath. Two. Three.

On the third, the air *does* change—not a gust, not a sound. It’s the sensation of a page being turned in a room you can’t see. The hairs along your wrist lift, then settle.

You sweep the hooded lamp low along the salt-arc.

Most grains sit exactly where you laid them—except for a thumb-wide crescent near the “giving edge” of the lid. There, the salt has slumped inward as if something gently exhaled across it from *inside* the seam. A few crystals have gone dull and grey, like they’ve been licked clean of their sharpness.

Halven Rook doesn’t answer immediately. His boots shift on stone—one half-step back, careful not to cross your arc. When he speaks, his voice is quieter than before.

“We didn’t move,” he says. “The Loom did. A stitch was taken up somewhere nearby. That’s why it felt like a skip.”

He leans in just enough that his shadow touches the edge of your lamp-glow, but not the seam.

“Lacuna Imprimatur,” he continues, clipped and precise, like reciting a rule he hates. “Signed by a Concord Warden-Scribe with a full seal-ring and a witness who can still be written into the ledger afterward. The price is always the same kind of thing: *a piece of record.* Usually a day you lived. Sometimes a name you answer to. Sometimes a witness’s memory of you. It doesn’t spill blood— it drains trace. You come out… harder to cite.”

The courier flinches when you demand a true detail. He swallows, then blurts the first thing he can, eyes locked on the seam and your salt.

“Your lamp’s flame has two colors,” he says. “Gold at the core—violet at the edge. And the violet edge is bending toward the lid like it recognizes it.”

As he speaks, the seam answers: a thin, threadlike tick—*tick… tick*—not ringing metal, but script tapping bone. The lid rises a hair on its own against your shims, as if something inside has found the gap and is testing it from the other side.

The threat is clear now: whatever is sealed beneath has noticed your light and is actively working the opening.

### Turn 102 [PLAYER]

I snap the lamp’s hood tighter and pinch the wick down until the violet edge thins, then turn the lamp so its metal back faces the seam—no direct gaze, no invitation. “Halven, talk me through a quick re-arc—what do we feed it: fresh salt, iron filings, ash?”

Without lifting my eyes, I slide the knife out, press the lid back down with the flat of my warded paper, and redraw the broken crescent with a dusting from my satchel—salt mixed with a pinch of soot. To the courier: “Don’t look at the seam. Hold your cloak up as a blind between the lamp and that gap—high and steady.”

*Agent reasoning: The lid is actively pushing and the salt is degrading; I need to stabilize the seal and cut the thing’s “interest” in my lamp’s violet edge. Also I want more intel, but safety first—re-arc the salt, dim/veil the lamp, and get Halven/courier to help without crossing the arc.*

### Turn 103 [GAME]

You pinch the wick down and cinch the hood. The violet fringe of flame thins to a bruised ember, then tucks itself inward. When you rotate the lamp so its metal back faces the seam, the pressure in the air eases a fraction—like an ear turning away.

The *tick… tick* from inside stutters, then goes searching again.

You slide the knife out cleanly. Using the flat of your warded paper, you press the lid down. It resists for a heartbeat—something inside pushing up—then yields with a soft, reluctant *thunk* as the seal’s tension re-seats. Your warded sheet takes the contact without scorching; the ink on its margin crawls a millimeter sideways as if bracing.

Halven answers fast, voice tight. “Fresh salt to re-state the boundary. Ash to confuse appetite. Iron only if you want it to *hurt* what’s inside—iron makes them angry.”

You dust the broken crescent with salt and soot. The soot doesn’t scatter like powder should; it clings in a thin crescent-vein, darkening the arc as if the line has been re-inked. The dull grey crystals brighten back toward white.

The courier obeys—jerky, terrified. He snaps his cloak up between lamp and seam, arms shaking, making a high, uneven blind. “Like this—like this—”

For a moment, it works. The seam quiets. No ticking.

Then the cloak’s hem twitches as if tugged by a small hook. Not hard—testing. The courier gasps and instinctively tightens his grip, pulling the fabric taut.

A sound leaks out anyway, not through sight but through *word*: a single, muffled syllable presses against the underside of your hooded lamp, vibrating the metal as if it were a page being thumped.

Halven’s hand goes to his seal-ring, but he doesn’t draw it. “It’s trying to route itself through anything that counts as a ‘witness,’” he warns, eyes flicking to the courier’s raised cloak. “Cloth counts. Breath counts. You’re buying seconds, not safety.”

From the seam, a thin line of soot on your new arc lifts—just one grain’s worth—hovering, then settling again, as if something inside has learned exactly where your boundary is and is tracing it from below.

*Triggered: watcher_Ed On The **[vacant]**_0_48ca0c*

### Turn 104 [PLAYER]

I grab a pinch of soot and smear it across my lips and under my nose, then whisper, “Courier—lower the cloak. Hold your breath and turn your face to the wall, hands over your ears.”  

To Halven, very low: “That syllable—did you catch which? If it’s a Name-start, we gag it.” I sprinkle a thin second crescent of ash just outside the salt-arc and tap my warded paper down over the “giving edge” like a lid-seal, listening for the seam to answer.

*Agent reasoning: It’s seeking a witness-channel; I want to cut off breath/cloth as conduits while learning what that syllable was, and reinforce the arc without escalating with iron unless necessary.*

### Turn 105 [GAME]

You smear soot across your lips and under your nose. It tastes like old paper burned in a careful fire—dry, bitter, oddly clean. Your own breath feels less *legible* afterward, as if you’ve blurred your mouth’s signature.

The courier lowers the cloak at your whisper. He obeys the rest too—turns his face to the mausoleum wall, clamps his hands over his ears, and holds his breath until his shoulders start to tremble. He’s trying very hard not to become a witness.

Halven tilts his head, listening like a man reading in the dark. “I caught the shape of it,” he murmurs. “Not a full syllable—more like the *start* of one. ‘El—’ or ‘Al—’. A Name-beginning, yes. It’s shopping for a throat.”

You lay a second crescent of ash just outside the salt-arc. The ash line doesn’t repel the seam so much as it *misdirects* it: the seam’s pressure drifts toward the ash like a hungry nose following smoke.

You tap your warded paper down over the giving edge.

For two heartbeats there is nothing—then the seam answers, not with ticking this time, but with a wet, thread-pull sound: *tch… tcha…* like stitches tightening in cloth. The warded paper tugs under your fingertips as if something beneath is trying to “read through” it.

A thin, pale filament—no thicker than a hair—pushes out from the seam and touches the underside of your warded sheet. The moment it makes contact, ink on your paper shivers into a tiny, involuntary loop—one letter’s worth—before your wards force it still.

Halven’s hand shoots out and clamps your wrist, hard. “Don’t let it write on your page,” he says. “It’s making a handle.”

The filament withdraws, then returns to a different point along the giving edge, searching. Each touch makes a faint *scratch* on the underside of your warded paper, like someone testing nib pressure.

Behind you, the courier finally has to breathe. He inhales sharply through his nose—just once.

The seam reacts immediately. The lid bumps upward against your paper with a small, decisive *knock*, and from inside comes that muffled start again—closer, clearer, forced through whatever counts as hearing:

“Al—”

The threat is specific now: the sealed thing is trying to anchor a Name into any available witness (breath, hearing, writable surface). Your warded paper is resisting, but each contact risks it “catching” a letter.

### Turn 106 [PLAYER]

I yank my warded paper away before it can “catch” another letter, crumple it ink-side inward, and shove it into my satchel’s ward-pocket. “Courier—stop breathing, now. Pinch your nose and bite your sleeve,” I hiss, then press my soot-smeared palm flat over the giving edge to mute both seam and sound.

To Halven, tight and urgent: “If it’s ‘Al—’, give me any counter-syllable—anything that unhooks Name-starts. And do you have wax? I want the seam *stuffed*—no air, no filament.”

*Agent reasoning: It’s trying to anchor a Name through writing and hearing; I need to remove writable surfaces and dampen sound fast, while keeping the seal pressed and redirecting its “search.”*

### Turn 107 [GAME]



*Triggered: watcher_Ed On The **[vacant]**_0_48ca0c*

### Turn 108 [PLAYER]

I clap my soot-smeared palm hard over the giving edge and lean my weight into it, keeping my face turned away. “Courier—pinch your nose, bite your sleeve, eyes shut; do *not* inhale the seam,” I snap.  

Without looking up, I ask Halven, “Do you have wax or pitch—anything to pack the seam? And give me a counter-syllable to break a Name-start—something we can repeat without becoming a witness.”

*Agent reasoning: The seam is trying to anchor through breath, hearing, and writable surfaces; I need to cut off witnesses and physically choke the gap while getting Halven to supply a counter-syllable or sealing material.*

### Turn 109 [GAME]

Your palm hits the giving edge with a dull *whap*. The metal is cold enough to sting through soot. You lean in—full weight, shoulder locked—keeping your face angled away.

It works, immediately and brutally: the lid can’t bump. The seam can’t “knock” itself into sound. The pressure under your hand turns into a trapped tremor, like a throat trying to speak with fingers on its mouth. Fine vibrations crawl up your wrist bones.

The courier jerks into the posture you order—nose pinched, sleeve between his teeth, eyes clenched shut. He makes a small, involuntary whine through fabric, then goes silent. You can see his chest trying not to rise.

Halven steps in close on your blind side so his shadow blocks the seam from any stray lamplight. “Wax—yes,” he says, already digging into the inner pocket of his warden’s coat. “Seal-wax pellets. Not much.” He presses three dull, amber beads into your free hand without letting them clatter.

“Pitch, no. But—” He pulls a stubby taper from a case and sparks it against his thumb-seal. A thin, steady flame catches—controlled, Concord-clean.

At your question about a counter-syllable, Halven’s jaw tightens. “You don’t *repeat* it,” he says. “Repetition makes a chorus. A chorus makes a doorway.” He leans to your ear, careful not to project toward the seam, and breathes the instruction as close as possible:

“Break it with a null-mark. Not a word. A sound that means ‘unwritten.’ Click your tongue once, then exhale through teeth—*tch*—like crossing out ink. Do it only when it starts. Not before.”

Under your palm, the seam tests you: the tremor shifts, concentrating at one corner. Something hair-thin tries to worry its way between lid and frame. You feel a faint, slick pressure—like a filament pressing against skin, seeking a pore or crease.

Halven holds the taper low. “If you lift even a finger, it’ll try to speak again,” he warns. “But if we melt wax into the edge, it’ll have to burn through to find air.”

The threat is immediate and physical now: a filament is probing for any gap under your hand, while the trapped Name-start is waiting for a moment of air or hearing to latch onto.

*Triggered: watcher_Ed On The **[vacant]**_0_48ca0c*

### Turn 110 [PLAYER]

“Halven—drip the wax along the edge under my wrist, slow. I’ll shift by knuckles—no air.”

I keep my face averted, then inch my palm a finger-width at a time, sliding pressure so there’s never a gap, and let one wax pellet soften in my free hand to smear into the corner where the filament worries. If the seam tries to voice that “Al—” again, I click once and cut it off with a sharp *tch* through my teeth.

*Agent reasoning: I need to keep pressure so it can’t speak, but also seal the seam; I’ll coordinate Halven to drip wax while I “walk” my hand to avoid gaps, and be ready to null-mark if it starts a syllable.*

### Turn 111 [GAME]

Halven brings the taper in low, shielding the flame with his sleeve. “Steady,” he says, and tips the first pellet into the heat until it beads, then runs like honey.

You shift by knuckles exactly as promised—pressure never fully leaving the lid. Halven threads the wax into the seam under your wrist in a slow, careful line. The first drip hisses as it meets the necropolis-cold metal, then clings. A second drip follows, then a third, each one thickening into a glossy ridge.

Under your palm, the trapped tremor changes pitch—less “throat,” more “insect in a jar.” The filament makes its move at the corner you’ve been feeling: it presses hard enough that you feel a distinct *sting*, like a needle trying to find purchase between skin and nail.

You soften a pellet in your free hand until it’s tacky, then smear it into that corner—wax pushed firmly into the angle where lid meets frame.

The filament touches the fresh wax and sticks.

For a heartbeat it holds—then it *pulls*, trying to draw the wax inward like thread through cloth. The wax stretches in a thin, pale strand… and snaps. The filament recoils, leaving a tiny hooked impression in the wax like a cursive thorn.

From inside, the thing attempts sound again—muffled, forced, furious. The beginning of the syllable gathers against the sealed edge:

“Al—”

You click once and cut it with a sharp *tch*.

The effect is immediate but not gentle. The sound inside collapses as if struck. The seam shudders so hard the lid tries to buck—your forearm absorbs the jolt. Halven flinches, then steadies his taper.

“Good,” he mutters, voice tight. “Only on the start.”

But the null-sound has a consequence: the wax ridge you’ve just laid darkens in a thin line, as if a scorch-mark wrote itself across it. Not burned by flame—burned by *denial*. The ridge holds, yet you can see it turning brittle where the “unwritten” touched the Name-start.

The courier, still biting sleeve, makes a panicked, tiny inhale through his teeth. The seam answers at once—another hair-thin probe scrapes along the wax line, searching for the weak, darkened section.

Halven swears under his breath and drips more wax to reinforce it. “If the courier breaks,” he says, “it’ll keep testing the wax until it finds a voice-gap. And if the wax goes brittle all the way through, it won’t need air—it’ll make a crack that *sounds* like a mouth.”

### Turn 112 [PLAYER]

Without lifting my face toward the seam, I bark to the courier, “Kneel—forehead to the wall. Press your palms flat over your nose and mouth and breathe *into your hands* only. Slow. Count with your fingers—no sound.”

To Halven, low: “Can we blunt the Name-start without the null-click—salt-hum, prayer-breath, anything that doesn’t turn wax brittle?” I slide a strip of warded paper from my satchel, fold it ink-side out into a tight band, and press it over the wax ridge like a splint, sealing its edges down with soot-salt paste while keeping my other hand’s pressure pinned to the lid.

*Agent reasoning: The courier’s breath is the biggest risk; I need to stabilize him and reinforce the seal without using the null-sound too much, since it brittles the wax. I’ll distract/occupy the courier with a physical task and add a nonverbal ward—paper bandage over wax—while asking Halven about alternatives.*

### Turn 114 [PLAYER]

Without turning my face toward the seam, I snap at the courier, “Kneel—forehead to the wall. Palms over your nose and mouth; breathe *into your hands* only, slow. Count on your fingers—no sound.”

I murmur to Halven, “Any way to blunt a Name-start without the null-click—salt-hum, prayer-breath, anything that won’t make the wax go brittle?” Keeping one hand clamped on the lid, I pull a strip of warded paper, fold it ink-side out into a tight band, and press it over the wax ridge like a splint, smearing soot-salt paste along the edges to seal it down.

*Agent reasoning: The seam is hunting for breath and sound; I need to control the courier’s breathing and reinforce the wax without using the brittle-making null-click, while asking Halven for a safer countermeasure.*

### Turn 115 [GAME]

The courier obeys fast—drops to his knees with a scrape of cloth on stone, forehead to the wall. He clamps his palms over nose and mouth as ordered. His breathing turns into a muffled, wet push into his own hands; his shoulders rise and fall in slow, counted beats. No voice escapes—just a faint skin-squeak as his fingers tick numbers.

That helps immediately: the seam stops “listening” for him. The probing along the wax ridge becomes less frantic, more methodical—like a quill testing paper instead of a mouth hunting air.

Halven answers your murmur without lifting his eyes to the lid. “Yes. Don’t *deny* it—*drown* it.” He shifts his taper away from the ridge so he isn’t heating the brittle line. “Concord uses a low prayer-hum. No consonants. All breath and vowel. It muddies the first letter without striking it.”

He demonstrates once, almost inaudible: a steady, throat-deep *oooo* shaped through closed lips, more vibration than sound.

You pull your warded paper strip. The moment it clears your satchel, the ink-side-out fold catches a sliver of mothlight and the warding glyphs wake—thin lines on the paper rise like gooseflesh. The air near the seam tightens as if the paper has just become the most interesting “page” in the alley.

You press the band over the wax ridge like a splint. It adheres—at first.

Then the seam reacts to the warding: a sharp internal scrape runs the length of the lid, and a hair-thin filament *hooks* the paper band from underneath. You feel it tug, trying to pull the strip into the seam the way a needle pulls thread.

You smear soot-salt paste along the edges. The salt bites—there’s a faint crackle, and the filament recoils, leaving a tiny tear in the paper where it snagged. The soot makes the paste tacky; it seals the band down, but unevenly. One corner puckers where the filament tested it.

Outcome: the “splint” holds for now, and the seam can’t easily probe the wax line. Consequence: the warded paper has become a lure—epitaph-spirits nearby shift toward you. At the edge of lamplight, two pale, letter-streaked wisps detach from a headstone and begin drifting closer, slow but intent, drawn to the exposed warding like hungry readers.

Halven keeps humming under his breath, steadying the lid with his shadow. “Keep that hum going,” he says, voice barely there. “If those spirits reach the paper, they’ll try to *finish* whatever it’s protecting.”

### Turn 116 [PLAYER]

I keep the low *oooo* hum going through closed lips, steadying my breath, and without lifting my sealing hand I swing my reliquary lamp outward to cast a wider mothlight arc—trying to herd the two letter-wisps back toward their headstone.  

In a whisper to Halven: “Epitaph-spirits—do they bargain if I offer them a safer text? If I peel the ward-strip off and replace it with plain paper, will the seam surge?”

*Agent reasoning: The warded paper is drawing epitaph-spirits; I want to learn what they are but can’t let them “finish” the ward. I’ll keep the hum to blunt the Name-start, use my lamp’s light to herd the wisps away, and try a quick question to Halven about negotiating with them.*

### Turn 117 [GAME]

Your closed-lip *oooo* turns your jaw into a tuning fork. The vibration runs down your wrist into the lid; the seam’s frantic “mouth-feel” dulls, as if its first letter is being smudged in wet ink.

Without lifting your sealing hand, you swing the reliquary lamp outward.

The mothlight arc widens—ash-gold and bruised violet spilling across the nearest headstones. The two letter-wisps react like startled moths: they hesitate, their streaked bodies thinning, then drift sideways away from the brightest part of the beam.

It’s only half a herding. One wisp retreats toward its headstone and presses against the carved name there, dissolving into the letters like breath into stone.

The other does not go back. It skirts the edge of your light instead—clever, hungry—circling to keep the warded strip in sight. It’s closer now, a pale ribbon of punctuation with a faint face inside it, mouth a crease that keeps trying to open.

Your lamp’s wider cast also catches something on the wall behind Halven: a pasted square of paper so thin it’s almost skin. For a blink, a pinhole in it gleams wetly—like an inked eyelid closing. Then it looks like nothing again.

Halven answers your whisper without breaking his own low hum. “They bargain,” he breathes, “but not like people. They trade in *completion*. Give them a ‘safer text’ and they’ll still try to finish it—sometimes by finishing you.”

He glances at the warded splint, then at your lamp. “If you peel the ward-strip, the seam will test the gap the instant it feels air. It won’t explode, but it will *probe*—fast. Plain paper won’t stop it; it’ll just become something it can write through.”

As if to prove him right, the seam gives a short, hard push under your palm—one decisive buck—then settles again under the hum. The warded strip puckers where the filament snagged earlier. You feel the hook searching that weak spot, patient now.

The remaining letter-wisp completes its circle and starts drifting in, drawn to the puckered corner. Threat clear: if it reaches the ward-strip, it will latch and “read” the warding—pulling at it until either the strip tears free or the seal is worried open.

### Turn 118 [PLAYER]

I keep the closed-lip *oooo* going and hold firm pressure on the lid. With my free hand I flick out a decoy scrap of plain paper and smear a quick line of fresh soot-ink on it—bold, unfinished—then extend it into the mothlight to draw the wisp away from the puckered corner.  

Without turning my face toward the seam, I murmur to Halven, “That pasted paper on the wall—did you see it blink? If it’s a watcher, can you peel it or pin it without breaking your shadow on the seam?”

*Agent reasoning: The letter-wisp is about to latch onto the warded strip; I want to distract it with something else “readable” while keeping the seal stable and investigating that blinking paper-eye on the wall.*

### Turn 120 [PLAYER]

I keep the closed-lip *oooo* humming and my sealing hand pinned hard on the lid. With my free hand I flick out a plain scrap, drag a bold unfinished soot-ink line across it, and hold it out into the mothlight to tempt the wisp away from the puckered corner.  

Without turning toward the seam, I murmur to Halven, “Did you see that pasted paper on the wall blink? If it’s a watcher, can you peel or pin it without breaking your shadow on the seam?”

*Agent reasoning: The letter-wisp is homing in on the puckered weak spot; a decoy “unfinished text” might lure it off the ward-strip. Also, that blinking paste-sheet on the wall feels like a hidden watcher; I want Halven to deal with it without losing pressure/shadow on the seam.*

### Turn 121 [GAME]

Your hum stays steady; the seam’s “searching” under your palm slows to a dull, irritated pressure. The lid doesn’t buck this time.

You flick out the plain scrap and drag a thick, unfinished soot-ink line across it—one bold stroke that stops mid-thought. The moment you hold it into the mothlight, the letter-wisp snaps its attention to it like a starving eye catching a title.

It drifts off the puckered corner and glides toward your decoy. When it reaches the paper, it doesn’t “bite” so much as *overlay* itself—its punctuation-streak body flattening across the line. The unfinished stroke starts to creep, not with your hand but with the wisp’s hunger: the soot smears forward a few millimeters, as if the paper is trying to complete the mark.

Consequence: it worked—your ward-strip gets a brief reprieve. But now the wisp is anchored to something you’re holding. The decoy scrap grows cold and slightly heavier, as though it’s taking on the weight of a sentence.

Halven answers your murmur, eyes still on the lid. “I saw it.” His voice stays low, threaded through his own hum. “That’s not a spirit. That’s a *listening page*—Concord uses them, Syndicate copies them. Either way, it reports.”

He shifts his stance without lifting his shadow from the seam—careful, precise. With two fingers of his free hand, he slides a thin iron pin from his cuff and, without looking away, reaches back and *pins the pasted square through its center* into the wall.

The paper on the wall reacts immediately: it twitches like skin. A tiny wet dot of ink blooms around the pinhead, then runs in a hairline toward the nearest crack in the stone—trying to “escape” as writing.

Halven hisses, “It’s still transmitting—slow. If it finishes that line into the crack, someone will know exactly where we are.”

At the same time, the seam senses the brief shift in Halven’s shadow and gives a single probing *scrape* under your palm—testing the edge of your ward-strip again. It doesn’t break through, but you feel the hook find the old snag point and worry it.

Threats now, clear and immediate:
1) The wisp is latched to your decoy scrap; if you pull it back toward you, it may climb your hand to reach the warded strip again.
2) The pinned listening page is bleeding a line into the wall crack; if it completes, your location gets reported.
3) The seam has re-found the weak puckered corner and is actively worrying it under your pressure.

I keep the *oooo* humming and my palm welded to the lid, then let the decoy scrap drop to the ground at arm’s length and pin it under my boot so the wisp stays busy finishing it down there instead of crawling up my hand.  

Without looking up, I flick a pinch of soot-salt paste off my fingertips onto the wall crack where the listening page’s ink-thread is running, trying to crust the line and stop it from “writing” into the stone. “Halven—if it still tries to transmit, can you yank the pin and fold the page in on itself, or will that break your shadow?”

*Agent reasoning: The listening page is an urgent “someone will know” problem, but I can’t let the seam get air; I’ll keep pressure/hum, use the wisp-latched scrap as a disposable sink, and try to salt-break the listening page’s ink line at the crack without stepping away.*

### Turn 129 [GAME]

Your *oooo* holds like a cork in a bottle. The reliquary lamp’s lid shivers under your palm—hotter, then cold—then steadies, as if whatever was inside has to settle for listening instead of speaking.

The decoy scrap flutters down. The epitaph-wisp—thin as breath, letters crawling along its edges—dives for it immediately. It presses itself to the paper the way a thirsty mouth finds a cup. Under your boot, the scrap goes damp and dark; the wisp’s script *finishes* lines that were never written, carving tiny, neat strokes into the fibers. It is occupied—hungry, intent.

Your soot-salt paste hits the wall crack with a soft *tch*. It crusts fast, turning the hairline fissure into a jagged seam of black-white scab. The ink-thread that had been strung there twitches once—like a muscle cut mid-spasm—then goes still. A faint, bitter smell rises (burnt candle-wick and iron).

Halven Rook doesn’t look away from the seam. He shifts his stance so his lantern-shadow stays pinned across the crack like a bandage. “I can,” he murmurs, voice tight. “But if my shadow slips, it’ll *hear* again.”

He slides two fingers under the pin holding the listening page, and with a careful, practiced motion, *unpins* it without lifting the paper from the wall. He folds it inward—once, twice—creasing it into a small, blind packet while keeping his body between the seam and the fold. The page gives a tiny, papercut squeal as if something inside it resists being shut.

“What it’s trying to say?” Halven swallows. “Not a message. A *route.* It’s writing coordinates in epitaph-cant—grave names as street names. It wants the lamp to walk itself to the stitched door.”

As he finishes the last fold, the crusted seam answers with a dull *tap* from inside the wall, like a knuckle testing a coffin lid. The wisp under your boot shudders—still feeding—but its strokes speed up, frantic, as if trying to complete the decoy before you move.

Without lifting my palm from the lid, I slide a warded sheet from my satchel and edge it toward the scrap to “catch” whatever route the wisp is carving when it’s done.

To Halven, still low: “Don’t crush that folded page—can I see its creases? If it wrote a route once, it might’ve left a ghost of it.” I glance at the crusted crack and then back to the lid’s seam, asking, “And the stitched door—here, or somewhere it wants us to *go*?”

### Turn 132 [PLAYER]

I keep the closed-lip *oooo* steady and grind my boot down just enough to keep the wisp pinned to the decoy, then slide a warded sheet from my satchel and edge it under the scrap to catch the last strokes as it “finishes.”  

Without lifting my palm from the lid, I murmur to Halven, “Let me see the fold-creases—slowly—don’t crush it; if there’s a ghost-route I can rub it up.” I flick my eyes to the crusted crack. “The stitched door—is it in this wall, or is this thing trying to send us somewhere else?”

*Agent reasoning: The wisp is actively writing a “route,” so I want to capture it without letting it climb me or alert the seam again; Halven’s folded listening page might hold an imprint, and I need to learn whether the stitched door is local or a destination.*

### Turn 133 [GAME]

Your *oooo* stays unbroken. The lamp’s lid warms under your palm, as if it’s trying to push up—then thinks better of it.

Under your boot, the wisp clings to the decoy scrap like wet cobweb. When you grind down, it doesn’t tear free; it *spreads*, flattening into a thin film of script that keeps writing even while pinned. The paper beneath your sole goes slick, ink seeping out at the edges.

You slide a warded sheet under the decoy. The moment the warded paper touches the ink-wet edge, the wisp reacts like a startled insect: its strokes jump sideways—off the decoy and onto your clean sheet—because the warding gives it a “surface that holds.”

In three quick, decisive lines, it finishes a crude route:

- a moth-wing sigil,
- three circled mausoleums,
- and a narrow rectangle marked with stitch-marks like a doorframe.

Then the wisp goes slack, the script paling to gray. It doesn’t vanish; it’s just…sated and dull, like an emptied pen.

Halven obeys your tone. He brings the folded listening page closer without unfolding it, angling it so your lamp-light grazes the creases. In the fold-lines, a faint “ghost-route” shows—indentations like the memory of a diagram. You can make out the same three circles, but one is crossed out and rewritten, as if the route has been *edited* since it was first recorded.

Halven whispers, “It’s not in this wall.” He nods at the crusted crack. “This seam was a listening point—like a keyhole. The stitched door is elsewhere. But—” he pauses as the wall answers with another dull *tap*, closer to the surface, testing the crust, “—something on the other side heard enough to start trying anyway.”

At the base of the crack, the soot-salt scab freckles—tiny pinpricks appearing as if pricked from within. A thin, dark dampness beads there, ink-black and slow, threatening to undermine your crust.

And from somewhere down the necropolis path, you hear the crisp scrape of boots and the soft clink of page-seals: Warden-Scribes moving in pairs, sweeping the corridor.

I snatch the warded route-sheet up and tuck it flat into my satchel sleeve, then, still humming, I press two fingers to Halven’s folded page and take a quick charcoal rub along the crease-lines onto a scrap of my own paper. “Good—edited route means someone’s correcting the map.”

I scrape the slack wisp-film and the soaked decoy into a tight wad and flick it toward the crack’s base to “feed” the weeping ink, then smear another quick band of soot-salt paste over the new pinpricks. To Halven, urgent whisper: “Wardens. Which mausoleum is closest—first circle or the crossed-out one? Lead, but keep your shadow off that seam.”

*Agent reasoning: Wardens are approaching, and the seam is starting to fail; I want to preserve the new route and the ghost-route, then get us out while leaving a misleading trail and buying time.*

### Turn 135 [GAME]

The warded route-sheet slides into your satchel sleeve cleanly—no snag, no bleed. Your hum keeps the air steady enough that the lamp doesn’t flare.

You press two fingers to Halven’s folded page and take your charcoal rub fast. The crease-lines bite back immediately: on your scrap, the “ghost-route” comes up as a shallow-relief diagram—three circles, one crossed out and rewritten with a tighter hand. In the margin, half-caught by the rub, there’s a thumbprint-shaped smudge of funerary gold dust—old, ground into the fold like it’s been handled at an auction table.

Halven’s eyes flick to that gold smear. His jaw tightens. He doesn’t comment, but he folds the page closer to his chest like it’s suddenly heavier.

You scrape the slack wisp-film and soaked decoy into a wad and flick it to the crack’s base. The weeping ink doesn’t “drink” it so much as *wick* it: the wad sticks to the dampness and begins to blacken from the edges inward, as if the wall is pulling the wet text through. For a second, the pinpricks stop widening.

You smear a fresh band of soot-salt over the new holes. It crusts—then immediately dimples, like something presses from behind. The dimples hold. Not broken, but under pressure.

Down the corridor, the boot-scrape resolves into voices—close enough to catch words.

“—satchel checks. Lamps forward. Pages out.”

Two Concord Warden-Scribes round the far bend, lanterns hooded to slits. Between them walks Acolyte Senn, head lowered, carrying a ledger-board like a shield.

Halven answers your question without turning his head, keeping his lantern-shadow pinned across the seam. “Closest is the *crossed-out* one,” he breathes. “They corrected it because the honest path collapsed. If we go for the first circle, we’ll loop.”

He shifts—carefully—so his shadow stays on the crack, but his body angles toward a narrow side passage between leaning headstones. “We move on my count. If my shadow slips, that thing starts listening again—and if the Wardens hear it tapping, they’ll blame the lamp.”

At the crack, the soot-salt band gives a soft, wet *tick*—a single stitch-like sound—then goes still.

### Turn 136 [PLAYER]

I keep the hum steady, slide my palm off the lid as gently as a bookmark, and drift toward Halven’s side passage with my satchel hugged tight. As we move, I call out softly toward the Wardens in my best dutiful tone, “Ledger-run for the Concord—ink leak sealed; we’re headed to the crossed-out mausoleum to verify a collapse mark.”  

Once we’re in the shadow of the leaning stones, I whisper to Halven, “That gold thumbprint—auction handling, right? Who’s been buying routes?”

*Agent reasoning: Wardens are about to spot us; I’m curious about Senn and that funerary gold, but we need to move. I’ll try a quick misdirect with a scribe-y lie while slipping into the side passage, and quietly probe Halven about the gold once we’re moving.*

### Turn 137 [GAME]

Your hum stays steady as you ease your palm off the lid. The lamp doesn’t flare—good—but the moment your hand leaves, the hood’s seam gives a tiny *sigh* of heat, like it wanted contact.

Halven moves when you do, keeping his body between the crack and open sightlines. You drift into the side passage between leaning stones, your satchel hugged tight; the stones are close enough to brush your shoulders with lichen that feels like dry, curled paper.

Your dutiful call carries.

One Warden-Scribe stops dead and lifts his lantern to a narrow slit. “Ledger-run?” he repeats, skeptical. The other’s gaze drops immediately to your satchel, then to your lamp. Acolyte Senn looks up sharply at the phrase “crossed-out mausoleum,” and you see his throat bob as he swallows.

“Name your superior,” the first Warden calls, stepping toward the passage mouth. “And show the page-seal.”

Halven answers before you can. “Rook. Warden-Scribe Halven Rook. This is my runner.” He raises his own seal-ring into the lantern slit, letting the Concord mark catch the light. It buys a heartbeat.

Not trust—just procedure. The nearer Warden slows, but doesn’t retreat. “Rook. You’re off-route,” he says, and his free hand already has a thin strip of binding paper ready, like a leash for a page. “Satchel check anyway. Curfew protocol.”

Behind you, from the direction of the crack, comes a faint, wet *tick tick*—two stitch-sounds this time—followed by a soft, hungry inhale against stone. The soot-salt is holding, but whatever is behind it has noticed the shadow moved away.

In the shadow of the leaning stones, you whisper about the gold thumbprint.

Halven’s eyes cut to the charcoal rubbing in your hand. “Yes,” he murmurs, voice tight. “Auction handling. Grave-Gild tables use that gold powder to ‘bless’ lots—makes buyers feel clean.”

He glances past you toward Senn and the Wardens, then back. “Who’s buying? People with money and fear. But the last consistent bidder—” his mouth flattens, “—used a monastery thumbprint. Restricted stacks. Someone who *shouldn’t be alive to bid*.”

The nearer Warden steps into the passage mouth, lantern slit widening. “Runner,” he says to you, “satchel. Now.”

### Turn 138 [PLAYER]

I dip my head obediently and start to open the satchel—slow, fussy—letting only blank warded paper show first. “Of course, Warden; mind the wards, they bite curious fingers.”

Then I tilt my chin toward the corridor behind them, voice tightening as if I’ve just noticed it too: “Do you hear that stitching—*tick tick*—from the sealed crack? If it’s waking, we’ll all be doing paperwork in blood.” I glance at Acolyte Senn. “You heard ‘crossed-out mausoleum’ and went pale—tell them why, before they make a spectacle of my bag.”

Under the cover of the exchange, I edge one step deeper between the leaning stones, keeping my body between the Warden’s lantern and the satchel sleeve where the route-sheet lies flat.

*Agent reasoning: A satchel check will expose the route-sheet and rubbing; I’ll stall with compliant theater, redirect scrutiny to the crack noises, and try to enlist Senn’s fear/knowledge while edging deeper into cover.*

### Turn 140 [PLAYER]

I bow and start opening my satchel slowly, fussily, letting only blank warded sheets show first. “Of course, Warden—mind the wards; they bite curious fingers.”  

I tip my chin toward the corridor. “Do you hear that stitching—*tick tick*—from the sealed crack? If it’s waking, we’ll all be doing paperwork in blood.” I look straight at Acolyte Senn. “You heard ‘crossed-out mausoleum’ and went pale—tell them why, before they make a spectacle of my bag.”  

As they look, I edge one step deeper between the leaning stones, keeping my body between the lantern slit and the satchel sleeve with the route-sheet.

*Agent reasoning: A satchel check could expose the route-sheet, so I’ll comply with harmless contents while redirecting attention to the ominous ticking and press Senn to explain; also inch deeper into shadow to keep the route hidden.*

### Turn 141 [GAME]

You bow and open the satchel with exaggerated care. The first thing the Warden sees is exactly what you want him to see: a neat stack of blank warded sheets, their edges faintly silvered with bite-runes. When his binding-paper hand reaches in, the top sheet gives a dry *snap* and his fingertips jerk back as if stung.

“Tch—” he hisses, shaking his fingers once. “Wards. Fine.”

Your warning about the stitching lands harder. The corridor behind them answers you: *tick tick*—then a third sound, a slow drag like thread being pulled through wet cloth. The air at the passage mouth cools abruptly, and the Warden’s lantern flame gutters to a thin, nervous tongue.

Both Wardens turn their heads toward the sound despite themselves.

Acolyte Senn goes rigid. His eyes fix on the dark corridor, not your satchel. “It’s—” he starts, then swallows. “That crack was sealed with a concordance stitch. If it’s ticking, it means the seam is… being read.”

“Being read by what?” the second Warden snaps, but his voice has lost some authority.

Senn forces the words out, fast and ashamed. “An epitaph-spirit. A hungry one. It listens for lamplight and unfinished lines.”

Halven doesn’t waste the opening. He steps half a pace forward—just enough to block the Wardens from pushing deeper into your little side passage—and points his lantern toward the corridor as if to take command of the problem. “You heard the acolyte,” he says. “If you want a spectacle, stand here and let it wake fully.”

While their attention is dragged toward the corridor, you edge one step deeper between the leaning stones.

You get the concealment you wanted for a heartbeat—then your heel nudges something half-buried in moss: a small memorial bell on a hair-knot cord. It doesn’t ring. It *clicks* once, sharply, like a page-tab.

The nearer Warden’s eyes snap back to you immediately.

“Hold,” he says, and this time he doesn’t reach into your satchel. He reaches for *you*—grabbing at your wrist to stop you backing farther in. “No further. Runner stays where I can see her.”

At the corridor mouth, the *tick tick* becomes a steady, patient rhythm, and the soot-salt smell turns sour, like damp ash. The crack isn’t open, but it is actively working—pressing, listening—drawn by the lamp’s presence and the Wardens’ exposed lanternflame.

Senn looks between the corridor and your lamp, voice thin. “Warden… we should hood the lights. Now.”

*Triggered: guard_Wall_0_6df9f8, fail_Wall_1_874d0d, watcher_Wall_1_fbde05, guard_Wall_1_a56667, secret_Wall_0_203864*

### Turn 142 [PLAYER]

I let the Warden catch my wrist but go limp, palms open. “Fine—keep hold; just don’t drag me into lamplight.”

I nod sharply at Senn. “Yes. Hood them—now—unless you want it reading *your* names next.” With my free hand I reach down and lift the little memorial bell by its hair-knot cord, holding it up for the Wardens to see. “This is a grave-tab; it’ll answer the seam if it’s listening. Warden—do I have leave to click it once, or will you?”

*Agent reasoning: The epitaph-spirit is reacting to light and unfinished lines; I need to de-escalate the Wardens, protect the route-sheet, and use the bell as a possible focus/distraction while getting everyone to hood their lamps.*

### Turn 143 [GAME]

The Warden’s grip on your wrist tightens, but he doesn’t yank you—more a clamp than a drag. “Stay,” he says through his teeth, eyes flicking between your lamp and the corridor.

Senn reacts to your barked order like it’s a lifeline. He snaps his lantern-hood down with both hands. The light collapses from a steady glow to a thin crescent. The other Warden follows a beat later, muttering a quick Concord syllable as he shutters his own lantern. The path around you dims; the air pressure in the corridor eases slightly, like something disappointed.

The *tick tick* from the sealed crack slows.

Not stops—slows, as if listening closer.

You lift the memorial bell by its hair-knot cord. Up close it’s not a bell at all—no clapper, no hollow. It’s a little brass tab stamped with a name that’s been scratched off so hard the metal is furred with burrs. The cord smells faintly of old rosemary and scalp-oil.

Halven’s eyes narrow at it. “Grave-tab,” he confirms, low. “A locator. Someone left it to be found.”

The Warden holding your wrist doesn’t like that. “You don’t have leave to signal anything,” he snaps, and reaches with his free hand to take the tab from you.

The moment his fingers close around the brass, the tab gives a single, involuntary *click*—not loud, but sharp enough to feel in your teeth.

The corridor answers immediately.

From the soot-salted crack comes a wet, satisfied inhale, and the seam-line—previously just a dark cut in stone—briefly brightens with hair-thin script, as if ink is surfacing under skin. A few letters become readable before they twist away: **…ROO— …SENN—** then smear into illegible loops.

Senn pales to the color of candle tallow. “It— it’s indexing us,” he whispers.

The Warden jerks his hand back from the tab as if it burned him. The tab drops, still dangling from your fingers. His grip on your wrist loosens half a fraction—not kindness, but fear.

Then the crack gives a soft, tearing *thip*, like a stitch pulled too tight.

A line of black thread—no thicker than a hair—pushes out through the seal and hangs in the air, wavering toward the nearest warmth and light: the thin crescent under Senn’s hood.

“It’s not open,” Halven says, voice controlled but urgent. “But it’s reaching.”

The thread twitches, testing the air, and begins to drift—slowly, purposefully—toward Senn’s lantern.

### Turn 144 [PLAYER]

“Snuff it, Senn—full hood, no crescent.” I twist my lamp’s hood down to a hairline too, then yank a blank warded sheet from my satchel and sweep it gently between the thread and Senn’s lantern like a screen.

With the same motion I press the sheet’s bite-rune edge toward the drifting thread to catch and pinch it, murmuring, “Read *this* instead,” and try to snip it free with a quick scrape of my charcoal stick. I scoop the grave-tab cord into my fist and hiss to Halven, “If it’s indexing names—can we feed it a false one? What’s the Concord’s dummy epitaph?”

*Agent reasoning: The thread is drawn to light/heat and is indexing names—dangerous. I want to protect Senn and learn what the grave-tab is keyed to, so I’ll snuff the lure, sever the thread safely, and pocket the tab for later study.*

“Snuff it, Senn—full hood, no crescent.” I crank my own lamp’s hood down to a hairline, then whip out a blank warded sheet and sweep it between the thread and Senn’s lantern like a screen.  

I press the bite-rune edge toward the drifting thread to catch and pinch it, murmuring, “Read this instead,” and try to snip it free with a quick scrape of my charcoal stick.  

I scoop the grave-tab cord into my fist and hiss to Halven, “If it’s indexing names—can we feed it a false one? What’s the Concord’s dummy epitaph?”

### Turn 148 [PLAYER]

“Snuff it fully, Senn—no crescent.” I hood my reliquary lamp down to a slit and slide a blank warded sheet between the thread and the lantern-light like a shield.  

Keeping my hands steady, I pinch the drifting black thread against the sheet’s bite-rune edge and scrape at it with my charcoal stick to sever it.  

Without looking away from the seam, I hiss to Halven, “If it’s indexing names, what’s the Concord’s dummy epitaph—what false name do you feed a hungry ledger to make it choke?”

*Agent reasoning: There’s no new scene text, so I’ll press the immediate threat: block the thread, reduce light, and interrogate Halven/Senn for a decoy-name while trying a warded capture.*

### Turn 149 [GAME]

Senn obeys so fast his fingers fumble; his hood snaps fully shut with a dull *clack*. The last crescent of lantern-light dies. Your own reliquary lamp narrows to a slit—just enough to see stone texture and the wet shine of the seam.

The black thread hesitates midair as if it’s lost the scent.

You slide the blank warded sheet in front of it. The warding takes—faint, chalky lines on the paper wake like sleeping ink, forming a shallow “bite” along the rune-edge. When you pinch the thread to that edge, it catches with a tiny, resistant *tink*, like snagging a hook on cloth.

The moment you murmur “Read this instead,” the thread shivers and presses into the paper. Letters start to bruise up through the sheet from the point of contact—backwards at first, then trying to right themselves. It’s indexing the page.

You scrape with the charcoal stick.

Charcoal is not a blade. It smears, grinds, and—worse—*writes*. The scrape leaves a thick black streak across the warded sheet, and the thread responds like a fish feeling a tug: it tightens, then *splits* into two finer hairs rather than snapping clean. One hair stays pinned in your bite-rune edge; the other whips free and darts back toward the seam.

It hits the crack and vanishes inside with a soft, hungry *sip*.

The seam immediately brightens with hair-thin script again, faster now, as if rewarded. Names try to assemble along the stone, stuttering: **ELD—** then crossed through by a wriggle of ink; **SENN** half-formed; **ROOK** briefly legible before it blurs.

Halven flinches at his own name appearing, then forces his voice steady. “Yes,” he says, low. “We have a dummy epitaph. We call it the *Ashen Witness*. ‘Here lies ASHEN WITNESS, who saw and said nothing.’ We feed it to ledgers, to traps, to anything that bites names.”

The Warden who’d grabbed you swallows hard. He’s stopped trying to take the tab now; his hand hovers, unsure, watching the writing like it might leap.

In your pinch, the captured hair-thread continues to burrow into the warded sheet, trying to complete a line—its “ink” bleeding into the paper’s fibers. The bite-rune edge holds it, but you can feel the tension climbing: if you let go, it will either lash for the nearest living name again… or drag your sheet toward the seam.

The threat is immediate and specific: the seam is actively indexing you by name, and the remaining thread in your grip is still “reading” and may pull free if the warding slips.

### Turn 150 [PLAYER]

I plant my boot on the bottom edge of the warded sheet to anchor it and, without letting the bite-rune edge slip, I whisper clearly at the seam: “Here lies **ASHEN WITNESS**, who saw and said nothing—index that, and be full.”  

With my free hand I shove the grave-tab cord toward the nearest Warden. “Tie this to that leaning stone—give it an anchor that isn’t *us*.”  

Then I glance at Senn in the dim. “Senn—does the Concordance stitch have a *closing phrase*? Tell me the words, now, before it finishes spelling anyone.”

*Agent reasoning: The seam is indexing our real names; I should bait it with the dummy epitaph while keeping the thread trapped, and anchor the warded sheet so it can’t drag me in.*

Then I angle my hooded lamp toward Senn just enough to catch his face. “Senn—does the Concordance stitch have a closing phrase? Tell me the words, now, before it finishes spelling anyone.”

### Turn 154 [PLAYER]

I blink into the hooded dark, tightening my grip on the warded sheet. “I’m not seeing the scene—what’s in front of me right now: the seam’s behavior, where Senn and Halven are positioned, and whether the Wardens have taken the cord?”

*Agent reasoning: The scene output is missing; I need clarification to respond in-character without inventing details, but my curiosity pushes me to ask what I can perceive and what options are present.*

### Turn 155 [GAME]

Your hooded lamp is down to a narrow slit of light—enough to see hands, boots, and the seam, but not the ceiling or anything beyond a few paces.

**What’s in front of you:**

- **You / the warded sheet:** You’re crouched close to the mausoleum seam with the **warded sheet** held up near chest height. One edge of it—the “bite-rune” margin—has **one hair-fine strand of stitch-thread** caught and held. The sheet is trembling slightly from the tension in that strand.

- **The seam’s behavior:** The crack in the stone is no longer “quiet.” It’s actively **brightening with hair-thin script**, like a sentence being written too fast to read. Every few seconds, a name almost resolves then gets **crossed out by its own ink**. You can clearly make out fragments as they flare and smear: **ELD—** (then struck through), **SENN** (half-formed), and **ROOK** (legible for a heartbeat before blurring). The seam is *indexing living names*—that’s the threat—and it’s doing it faster than before.

- **Senn:** Senn is **one step behind and to your left**, shoulders hunched, hood snapped shut. He’s holding his hands up near his collar like he’s afraid to touch anything. He’s staring at the seam even though he can barely see it, listening to the scratch-sound of the script. He hasn’t spoken since the hood went down; his breathing is quick and shallow.

- **Halven Rook:** Halven is **to your right**, closer than Senn—about an arm’s length away—half-turned so he can watch both you and the corridor behind. His lantern is also hooded. His jaw is tight; his eyes keep flicking to the momentary appearance of **ROOK** on the seam. He’s ready to grab you or the sheet if it jerks.

- **The other Wardens / the cord:** The nearest Warden **has taken the grave-tab cord**—it’s looped around his gloved hand. He has *not* tied it off yet. He’s looking between Halven and the leaning stone you indicated, hesitating like he expects a command or a punishment for moving wrong. The second Warden is a pace behind him, watching the seam, blade-hand hovering near his belt seal.

**Immediate danger, clearly:** the seam is actively trying to complete and “accept” a living name. If it finishes one cleanly, the air around that person feels like it will *tighten*—as if the mausoleum could claim them by inscription.

### Turn 156 [PLAYER]

I hiss at the Warden with the cord, “Now—tie it off to the leaning stone, tight, and don’t look at the writing.”  

Keeping the thread pinned in the bite-rune edge, I lean toward the seam and speak clearly, steady as a grave-prayer: “Here lies **ASHEN WITNESS**, who saw and said nothing. Index that, and be full.”  

Without turning my head, I murmur to Senn, “Closing phrase—if you know it, give it to me. Even half of it.”

*Agent reasoning: The seam is trying to finalize our names; I need to feed it a false epitaph immediately and get the cord anchored to a stone to divert the pull. I also want Senn to give any closing phrase while Halven watches our backs.*

### Turn 157 [GAME]

The Warden with the cord jolts like you slapped him awake. He nods once—too hard—then turns his face away from the seam and moves by feel.

He hooks the cord around the **leaning headstone** you indicated and yanks it tight. The stone grinds a fraction in the wet soil. The cord goes taut with a low, harp-string hum.

The moment the cord takes tension, the seam’s hairline script **snaps toward it**—not physically, but in attention. The bright fragments that were trying to finish **ROOK** and **SENN** stutter, then smear sideways as if someone dragged a wet quill.

You lean in and speak: **“Here lies ASHEN WITNESS…”**

The seam **answers**.

For a heartbeat the scratch-sound becomes a dry, satisfied **page-turn**. The writing along the crack blooms into a single, clean line—legible in the slit of lamp-light:

**ASHEN WITNESS — WHO SAW AND SAID NOTHING.**

Then the letters sink into the stone like ink into blotting paper. The air pressure around your throat eases—subtle, but real—as if a tightening hand reconsidered.

But “be full” has its own appetite. The seam drinks the offered name and immediately tries to **fill itself further**: new strokes spark, hungry and fast. This time it reaches outward along the cord’s direction, as though the cord is a **bookmark** leading it to the headstone.

At the leaning stone, the cord twitches—once—like something tugged from the other side. The Warden flinches and almost looks, then clamps his eyes shut and braces his boot against the base.

Senn swallows audibly. He finally speaks, voice thin and shaking, keeping his gaze down at your boots.

“C-Closing… we were taught—only as a ward—” He forces the words out like they hurt. “**‘…and let the candle keep what the tongue would steal.’** That’s… that’s the last half. The first half was *never written* in our primers.”

Halven shifts closer to you, low and urgent. “Moth—whatever you just fed it, it noticed the cord. If it finishes an index at that stone, it won’t be a name. It’ll be an *address*.”

### Turn 158 [PLAYER]

I snap, “Cut the cord—now!” and jab my charcoal at the Warden like a command-staff.  

Still pinning the thread in the bite-rune edge, I whisper to the seam, slow and firm: “By wick and wax—let the candle keep what the tongue would steal.”  

Then, without looking up, I murmur to Senn, “Never written isn’t never spoken—what do you *say* before that line, in the Concord’s rites?”

*Agent reasoning: The seam is using the cord as a pointer; I need to cut that “bookmark” and seal the indexing with the closing phrase fragment. Also I’m curious about the missing first half—maybe I can improvise it from monastic candle-wards.*

### Turn 159 [GAME]

The Warden with the cord hesitates—one fatal half-second of obedience to procedure—then Halven barks, “Do it,” and that breaks him free.

Steel whispers. The Warden draws his short cutter and **saws through the grave-tab cord**.

The instant the fibers part, the taut hum stops—and something on the far end **yanks**.

The severed length snaps sideways and **lashes the Warden’s wrist**, leaving a thin red welt like a paper-cut made of rope. The cut end doesn’t fall limp. It **skitters** across the wet stone toward the seam as if pulled by invisible fingers, then goes still, quivering.

At the leaning headstone, the loop you’d tied slips and drops away. The headstone settles back with a soft, damp **thunk**. Whatever “bookmark” you’d made is gone.

You whisper your closing line into the crack:  
“**By wick and wax—let the candle keep what the tongue would steal.**”

The seam’s frantic script **stutters**. The new strokes that were racing toward the headstone **curl inward**, as if embarrassed to be seen. The scratch-sound becomes a low, irritated hiss—like a quill dragged against sand.

Then the seam “tests” you: three words flare in quick succession, each trying to hook to a living throat.

**MOTH** (half-formed, crossed out)  
**ROOK** (formed, then smeared)  
**SENN** (formed cleanly—too cleanly—and held for a heartbeat)

Senn makes a small choking sound and clamps a hand to his own collar, eyes squeezed shut. Halven steps between Senn and the seam without thinking, shoulder angled like a shield.

You ask Senn for the missing line.

Senn swallows hard. “We… we say it,” he admits, voice barely there. “Just not where ink can catch it.”

He draws one breath, then speaks the forbidden first half in a rush, like spitting out a thorn:

“**By mercy unrecorded and flame uncounted—**”

As the words leave him, the seam’s light surges—hungry—and the clean **SENN** on the stone tries to *finish itself*, adding a trailing flourish like a noose being tied.

Halven’s hand shoots out and clamps over Senn’s mouth. “No more,” he growls—too late to unsay what’s already been offered.

**The threat is immediate and specific:** the seam is now actively attempting to **complete Senn’s inscription**. If it finishes, Senn will be “indexed” the way your offered epithet was—except it will treat him as a living entry to be claimed, not a substitute to be consumed.

### Turn 160 [PLAYER]

I grab Senn by the collar and haul him two steps back behind me and Halven, then snap to Halven, “Keep his mouth covered—no more words.”  

I slap a fresh warded sheet over the seam like a blotter and drag my charcoal hard across where **SENN** is forming, grinding it into a black smear. “Here lies **ASHEN WITNESS**, who saw and said nothing—take that ink, not his breath.”  

Under my breath, I stitch the whole rite together like a single sentence: “By mercy unrecorded and flame uncounted… by wick and wax—let the candle keep what the tongue would steal.”

*Agent reasoning: The seam has latched onto Senn’s true-name inscription; I need to interrupt the “writing” by giving it a safer entry and/or smearing the forming letters, while physically pulling Senn back from the seam’s influence. I’m curious about how it “reads,” but keeping Senn alive comes first.*

### Turn 167 [GAME]

Senn’s next syllable dies under your palm with a wet, panicked swallow. He obeys—nostrils flaring, breathing sharp through his nose—while Halven catches Senn by the collar and hauls him tighter behind his own shoulder like a shield he hates needing.

The seam in the mausoleum stone—hairline at first—had begun to bead ink. Under your warded sheet it spreads anyway, pressing up as raised, blind lettering. The moment your charcoal grinds down, the forming **SENN** buckles. The letters don’t vanish; they *misprint*. The name collapses into a thick bruise of black, and the ink tries to reassert itself at the margins—little hooked strokes searching for a clean edge to climb.

Your epitaph—**ASHEN WITNESS**—lands like a stamp.

The pressure under the paper eases. Not gone—contained. The seam gives a small, audible *tck* as if a stitch has been tightened from the other side. The ink that had been trying to write a name turns greedy and drinks the charcoal instead, wicking it into thread-thin capillaries that spider out across your sheet… and then stop at the warding lines as if hitting glass.

When you breathe the stitch-rite in one unbroken thread, your reliquary lamp answers without being asked: the flame narrows to a needlepoint, then steadies. Warmth travels up your wrist and into the paper, sealing it to the stone with a faint tackiness like cooling wax.

Halven’s eyes flick to the lamp, then to your hands. “You just *reassigned* a claim,” he says, low and hard. “Do you understand what you fed it?”

Senn trembles once, then goes still. When you finally ease your grip enough for him to whisper, he doesn’t speak a name—he rasps, “It was taking my… *index*. Like I was a word in its mouth.”

From the sealed seam comes a new sound: not ink, not breath—*scratching*, slow and deliberate, as if something inside is trying to write its way out around your warded sheet. The paper holds, but the scratching starts to travel laterally along the stone, searching for another place to surface.

### Turn 168 [PLAYER]

I keep my warded sheet pressed with my forearm and angle my reliquary lamp to chase the scratching along the stone, watching for where it wants to surface. “Halven—what does an ‘Ashen Witness’ buy us here, and what does it *owe* later?”  

Without letting Senn speak, I squeeze his shoulder once. “Nod if you can breathe. Don’t answer out loud.”  

I pull a second warded sheet and start laying it edge-to-edge along the direction the scratching travels, like patching a running crack. “If it wants another mouth, we’ll give it paper—show me where you’re trying to write.”

*Agent reasoning: The seam is trying to route around my ward; I want to track where it’s going and learn what “Ashen Witness” cost us. I’ll keep Senn safe, question Halven, and probe the stone with light and paper to map the scratching.*

### Turn 169 [GAME]

You keep the first sheet pinned with your forearm; the wax-tack holds, but it pulls at your skin like a mild burn. When you angle the reliquary lamp, the needle-flame throws a tight oval of light across the mausoleum’s face.

The scratching becomes visible in the lamplight as *movement in the stone’s dust*: fine grit shivers in a line, traveling rightward along a mortar seam. Where it passes, hairline script briefly lifts—pale, raised strokes like dried glue—then collapses back into plain stone. It’s not random. It’s *spelling while it searches*.

Senn nods fast when you squeeze his shoulder—he can breathe. His eyes are wet and fixed on the seam like it’s a throat.

Halven answers your question without taking his gaze off the wall. “An Ashen Witness buys you a substitute—an acceptable silence. It tells the claim there’s already a recorded absence, so it can stop hunting a living name.” His jaw tightens. “What it owes later is simple: testimony. Someday it will come to collect what the witness ‘saw and said nothing’ about. And it will try to make that true.”

You slide the second warded sheet edge-to-edge in the direction the scratching runs. The moment the paper overlaps the seam by a thumb’s width, the scratching *hits it*—hard enough that you feel the vibration through the sheet. A line of ink blooms under the paper like a bruise spreading in water, and for an instant letters try to emboss through from beneath, reversed as if read from inside a coffin.

Then the warding bites. The ink stops at the sigils and begins to pool at the nearest unwarded edge—your overlap line—testing it like a tongue on a loose tooth.

Halven shifts, bracing his shoulder against the mausoleum to keep the sheets from peeling. “It’s learning your seams,” he mutters. “Don’t give it gaps.”

The scratching abruptly detours *downward*, toward the base of the wall. Dust lifts in a narrow stream and skitters into a drainage crack between stones. The threat is clear: it’s trying to surface somewhere your paper can’t easily cover—below, where the wall meets the ground.

From that crack, a thin exhale of cold air leaks out, smelling of wet vellum and old funerary gold.

### Turn 170 [PLAYER]

I swing the lamp low to the base crack and lean in, trying to catch even a fragment of the raised script in the dust. “Halven—hold both sheets flat; Senn, hands over your ears and keep your mouth shut.”

I yank a strip of warded paper from my satchel, fold it into a tight wick, and stuff it into the drainage crack, then press the lamp’s heat close as if to melt wax into a seal. Under my breath: “No mouth below, no mouth above—if you must write, write where I can read you.”

*Agent reasoning: The thing is trying to escape where paper won’t cover—down at the base crack—so I need to redirect or seal that exit fast. I also want to learn what it’s spelling and what “testimony” might mean later, but survival first.*

### Turn 171 [GAME]

You drop the lamp low. The needle-flame paints the base crack in a hard white line, and the dust there isn’t settling—it’s *standing up* in tiny ridges like iron filings near a magnet.

In that dust, for a blink, you catch a fragment of raised script trying to assemble itself along the crack’s lip: **…WITN…** then it shivers apart as if ashamed of being seen.

Halven obeys instantly—both palms flatten on your overlapping warded sheets, shoulders hunched, using his weight to keep the “patch” from lifting. “Senn—do it,” he snaps.

Senn clamps his hands over his ears and presses his lips together so hard they blanch. He keeps his eyes open, staring at your hands like he’s afraid to blink and let a word slip out.

You tear a strip of warded paper, fold it tight into a crude wick, and ram it into the drainage crack. The moment it seats, something on the other side *pulls*—not enough to take it, but enough to make the paper tremble as if being tasted.

When you bring the lamp’s heat close, the reliquary flame reacts like it recognizes a rite: it lengthens, then flattens against the crack as if trying to become wax itself. The air in front of the flame ripples. The warded “wick” darkens at the tip, not burning—*inking*, as if the crack is feeding it pigment.

Your seal works—partly. The cold exhale stops, and the scratching below goes silent.

But the pressure doesn’t disappear. It relocates.

Up under Halven’s hands, the patched seam *bulges* once, like a pulse. Ink spreads under the second sheet in a thin, urgent line, racing for the nearest gap it can find: the edge where the two warded sheets meet. The overlap holds, but the ink starts to *write along the join* in cramped, inverted letters, as if using the seam between papers as its new “mouth.”

Halven jerks as he feels it. “It’s talking anyway,” he growls. “Through the edge.”

Senn makes a muffled sound behind sealed lips—pain, not speech—and squeezes his eyes shut.

The threat is immediate and specific: the thing can’t surface through the stone crack now, so it’s attempting to force legible text along the paper-to-paper seam. If it completes a name or claim there, it may “assign” that claim to whoever is closest to the join—your forearm, Halven’s hands, or Senn’s presence behind you.

### Turn 172 [PLAYER]

“Halven—don’t lift, but slide your hands back an inch, slow.” I pull my forearm off just long enough to slap a third warded sheet crosswise over the join like a bandage, then press my palm flat and let my lamp’s heat ‘wax’ it down into one continuous skin.  

I lean close to the edge-text and, instead of reading it aloud, trace the inverted letters with charcoal into my own notebook as nonsense marks—eyes only—murmuring, “Write for the lantern, not the living.”

*Agent reasoning: The ink is exploiting the join between my sheets; I should remove the “mouth” by making the overlap a single continuous seal, and I want to see what it’s trying to say without letting it complete a claim on any of us.*

### Turn 173 [GAME]

Halven slides his hands back exactly an inch—slow, knuckles whitening—never breaking contact. The ink-line under the seam surges toward the warmth you just vacated, like water seeking a low point.

You lift your forearm for the briefest moment. The patched sheets try to peel with a soft *skritch*—as if the wall itself has hooked them—then you slap the third warded sheet crosswise over the join.

It catches.

When you press your palm flat and bring the lamp close, the reliquary flame flattens again, heat blooming through the fibers. The three sheets tack together into one continuous “skin.” The ink that had been writing along the join hits the new crosswise warding and stops dead, pooling in a blunt oval. The scratching sound returns for half a second—furious, trapped—then collapses into silence.

Halven exhales through his teeth. “Good. Keep it sealed.”

Senn—still hands over ears, mouth shut—staggers a half-step as if the floor shifted under him. A thin line of blood appears at one nostril. He does not speak.

You lean in to the edge-text. There’s still writing trying to exist, but now it’s trapped under layers—letters pressed flat and reversed, like an insect under glass. You don’t read it aloud. You trace what you *see* into your notebook as nonsense marks.

The moment charcoal touches your notebook page, the marks don’t stay nonsense.

They try to self-correct.

Your copied strokes subtly tug into more legible forms—curves tightening, angles aligning—like the page wants to become a clean transcript. The warding on your notebook paper (if any) isn’t the same as the sheets on the wall; the ink-pressure finds that difference and exploits it. The copied line begins to resemble a phrase, half-formed and mirrored:

**BRI… LAMP… STIT… DOOR…**

Your lamp flickers once—just once—like a blink. The flame remains steady after, but you feel a quick, cold pinprick behind your left eye, as if something has taken note of you *taking note*.

Halven notices the flicker and snaps his gaze to your notebook. “Don’t—” he starts, too late, then lowers his voice. “Eldra. That’s how it gets out. Not through stone. Through *copying*.”

The immediate threat shifts: the wall is sealed for now, but your notebook page is actively being coerced into a readable message. If the text completes into a clear instruction or name, it may become a new “stitched route” anchor—portable, and tied to you and the lamp.

### Turn 174 [PLAYER]

I snap the notebook shut on the half-formed line and bind it with a warded paper strap from my satchel. “No more copying—my fault.”  

I tilt the lamp away and pinch my own left eyelid, testing the pinprick. “Halven, keep pressure on the wall—does it still feel like it’s pushing?”  

Then I crouch to Senn, offering a clean cloth. “Don’t speak—just point: is that pain in your head, your throat, or your chest?”

*Agent reasoning: The message is trying to escape through my notebook; I should stop the transcription and quarantine the page without reading it aloud, while checking on Senn and keeping the wall sealed.*

### Turn 175 [GAME]

You clap the notebook shut before the charcoal line can finish “settling” into legible words. The cover meets the paper with a dull *thump*—and the pinprick behind your left eye answers with a quick pulse, like a needle withdrawing.

You wrap it with a warded paper strap from your satchel and cinch it tight. The strap warms under your fingers as the warding catches; a faint, dry scent of candle wax rises. For a moment the strap’s inked sigils look slightly misprinted—as if something tried to mirror them—then they hold. The notebook goes still. No more tugging at the edges.

You tilt the lamp away and pinch your eyelid. The pain is localized: not an injury, more like pressure behind the eye. When you press, you see a brief afterimage—thin black strokes, like a single word written on the inside of your skull—then it fades before it resolves.

Halven keeps both hands planted on the paper-skin over the mausoleum seam. “It’s not pushing like before,” he says, voice tight with concentration. “It’s… waiting. Like it’s listening for a new gap.” He shifts his weight minutely. “The wall’s cold again. That’s good.”

You crouch to Senn and offer the cloth. He takes it with shaking fingers and dabs his nose, careful not to open his mouth. His eyes flick to Halven, then back to you.

When you ask him to point, he hesitates—then taps two places: first his **throat**, then his **temple**. After a beat he presses two fingers to the hollow above his collarbone, **center chest**, as if indicating the pressure is sinking.

As he points at his throat, the cloth in his hand darkens—not with blood, but with a thin *ink-gray smear* that wasn’t there a second ago, like soot dragged from a page. Senn freezes, staring at it.

Halven sees the smear and immediately lifts one hand *just enough* to grab Senn’s wrist—without releasing the wall entirely. “Don’t wipe it on anything else,” he orders. “That’s how it spreads.”

The threat is now concrete: whatever was trying to “mouth” through the seam has left a residue that’s seeking a new surface—cloth, skin, paper—anything it can mark. If it finds a clean page or an unwarded edge, it may start writing again, this time through Senn.

### Turn 176 [PLAYER]

I snatch another warded sheet and, without touching the smear, fold it around the cloth like a specimen envelope. “Halven—keep him still; I’m bagging the soot.”

I hold the reliquary lamp close to the folded paper until it tacks shut. Then I take Senn’s free hand and press two fingers to his wrist, watching his face. “Blink once if you can still breathe easy through your nose. Twice if it feels like it’s tightening.”

*Agent reasoning: The ink-residue is the immediate danger; I want to contain it without giving it new surfaces, and I’m curious what “word” flashed behind my eye but won’t risk writing it. I’ll use the lamp/warding to trap the smear and check Senn’s breathing silently.*

### Turn 177 [GAME]

You fold the warded sheet around the cloth without letting it brush anything else. The moment the ink-gray smear is enclosed, it behaves like a living stain: it *creeps* toward the nearest crease, searching for an edge.

The warding stops it.

It hits the inner fold and flattens, leaving a sharp, fern-like imprint as if it tried to become a letter and failed. You bring the reliquary lamp close. The flame’s heat tacks the paper shut—fibers tightening, seal-lines knitting. Inside, the smear gives a single faint *scrape* like a quill dragged across bone, then goes quiet.

Halven keeps Senn pinned with one forearm while maintaining pressure on the wall with the other hand and his shoulder. “Still,” he says to Senn through clenched teeth. To you, lower: “Good. Don’t open that again.”

You take Senn’s free hand and check his wrist. His pulse is fast and a little uneven—he flinches at your touch, not from pain but from a reflexive fear of contact. His skin is cold-damp.

You ask for blinks.

Senn stares at you hard, then blinks **twice**—deliberate, strained. After the second blink, his nostrils flare as if he’s forcing air through a narrowing passage. He presses his tongue against the inside of his closed lips, panic rising in his eyes.

Halven’s head snaps toward Senn’s face. “Throat’s tightening,” he says, immediate and practical. He shifts his grip to keep Senn’s chin slightly up, trying to keep the airway open without making him speak. “If he coughs, it’ll try to *write out* through breath.”

At the sealed wall, under Halven’s braced shoulder, you feel (more than hear) a soft *tap…tap…tap*—not pushing, not scratching. A patient, rhythmic knock from the other side, as if something has learned you respond to signals.

The immediate threats are now twofold and clear:
1) Senn’s airway is tightening; if it escalates into coughing or choking, whatever’s in him may attempt to externalize as ink-breath or spoken script.
2) The thing behind the wall has stopped forcing and started communicating—testing for a response, a pattern, a “reply.”

### Turn 178 [PLAYER]

I turn my body to block Senn’s view of the wall and raise my lamp between him and the seam like a small sun. “Senn—eyes on the flame. Match me: in through the nose, out through the nose,” I demonstrate slow, steady breaths with my lips sealed, then press my thumb gently at the soft spot above his collarbone to cue his throat to relax.

To Halven, in a low hiss: “Do not answer the tapping—no rhythm back.” I edge a spare warded sheet under Halven’s elbow as a buffer and whisper, “If he has to cough, I’m sealing his mouth with paper—tell me now if that’ll make it worse.”

*Agent reasoning: Senn’s airway is the urgent problem; I need a nonverbal, non-writing way to ease it, while refusing the wall’s “conversation” so it can’t latch onto a pattern.*

### Turn 179 [GAME]

You step between Senn and the seam, and the effect is immediate: his eyes stop darting to the wall and lock onto your lamp’s steady flame. The reliquary light doesn’t “burn” the air, but it makes the ink-dark corners retreat into ordinary shadow.

You demonstrate: lips sealed, slow inhale through the nose, slow exhale through the nose. Senn tries to match you. The first breath catches halfway in—his nostrils flare, panic spikes—then you press your thumb into the soft hollow above his collarbone.

His shoulders drop a fraction.

On the next inhale he gets more air. Not comfortable, but possible. He exhales through his nose in a thin stream. His pulse under your fingers stays fast, but the erratic flutter smooths into a rapid, steadier beat.

Behind you, the tapping at the seam continues for three beats… then stops, as if it noticed you refused to “converse.”

Halven nods once at your warning, jaw clenched. He does not answer the wall with any movement beyond holding pressure. When you edge the spare warded sheet under his elbow, it slides into place with a papery rasp. The wall’s cold seeps into it; the sheet’s warding takes, turning the edge-text on the paper slightly darker, like it’s drinking chill.

Halven whispers back, careful not to shape the words toward the seam. “If he coughs, don’t seal his mouth shut.” His eyes flick to Senn’s throat. “It’ll trap the pressure and force it to write somewhere else—eyes, ears, skin. Better to give it one clean place it can’t mark.”

As if to prove the point, a thin thread of ink-gray appears at the corner of Senn’s right nostril—barely a smear, like soot caught in sweat. It doesn’t drip; it *tests* the edge, then retracts when it meets the lamp’s light.

Senn blinks hard and raises two fingers toward his nose, asking silently if he should wipe. Halven catches his wrist before he can touch his face.

Threat, now explicit: Senn is stabilizing, but the “script” is probing for an exit through nostrils/skin contact. If anyone wipes it onto cloth, paper, or the wall-sheet, it may gain a new surface to continue writing—or jump hosts.

### Turn 180 [PLAYER]

I keep the lamp steady on Senn’s face and gently take his raised fingers, guiding his hand down. “No wiping—just breathe with me.”

I pull a fresh warded sheet and fold it into a stiff little nose-guard/funnel without touching him, then hold it a finger’s width under his nostrils to catch anything that tries to drip—never letting it touch skin. To Halven, quiet: “Does the lamp’s light *repel* it, or just make it hide—what did you see last time this happened?”

*Agent reasoning: The ink is testing exits via Senn’s nose and any wiping could spread it; I want to contain it without giving it a writable surface, and also learn what the lamp is doing to it.*

### Turn 181 [GAME]

You guide Senn’s fingers down before they can reach his face. He resists for half a heartbeat—instinct screaming to wipe—then yields and fixes on the flame again. He keeps breathing with you: in through the nose, out through the nose, shallow but controlled.

You fold the fresh warded sheet into a stiff little funnel and hold it just beneath his nostrils, leaving a careful gap so it never touches skin.

On Senn’s next exhale, a faint mist of damp breath hits the paper. For a second, nothing else happens.

Then the ink-gray at the edge of his right nostril *threads outward*—not a drip, a filament—reaching for the nearest surface like a spiderline. It stretches, quivers… and touches the warded paper’s inner lip.

The moment it contacts the warding, it snaps flat into a tiny, starburst blot, as if it struck glass. A hair-thin line tries to continue, forming the first stroke of a letter—then the warding “catches” and the line breaks into harmless grit.

Senn’s eyes widen at the sensation of something leaving him. His next inhale is deeper—still tight, but less desperate. He blinks once, then holds your gaze, silently asking if that was good.

Halven watches the paper-funnel with a grim, almost relieved focus. At your question, he answers without looking away from Senn’s face. “It hides from the light—until it thinks it has a surface it can *keep*.” He swallows. “Last time it didn’t fight the flame. It waited for a cough and took the inside of a man’s sleeve. Wrote three words before we burned the cloth. The words were… instructions.”

As he says “instructions,” the seam behind your shoulder gives a single soft *tap*—not rhythmic, just one. Like a punctuation mark.

Halven stiffens. “It learns.”

Right now, your improvised nose-guard is working: it’s catching the escaping soot-script and forcing it to fail on warding. But it also gives the thing a consistent “target” to test—if your grip slips and the paper touches Senn’s skin, it may bridge from host to page in a more stable way.

### Turn 182 [PLAYER]

I keep the funnel steady but shift it onto a quick little paper “stand” on the floor—two folded warded sheets like a cradle—so it can sit under Senn’s nostrils without my hand shaking or drifting into his skin. “Senn, stay very still—keep breathing, you’re doing it right.”

To Halven, barely a whisper: “What were the three words it wrote last time—exactly?” Then I glance over my shoulder at the seam without moving my feet and murmur, “And can you feel any warm spots or bulges through the patch, or is it staying flat-cold?”

*Agent reasoning: The warded funnel is helping but risky if it touches Senn; I want a safer catch method and to learn what the “instructions” were, while also checking the seam without engaging its taps.*

### Turn 183 [GAME]

You build the cradle fast: two warded sheets folded into stiff tents, their creases aligned so the ward-text sits “upright.” You set the funnel atop them and slide the little stand into position under Senn’s nose.

It works—but not cleanly.

As the stand crosses the stone, the necropolis floor’s ink-slick damp grabs at the bottom edge. One corner of the cradle drinks in a smear of black moisture. The warding holds, but the wet spot blooms into a faint halo of cramped, illegible micro-script—like the floor tried to annotate your paper and failed to find a grammar.

Senn stays still. He breathes. On his next exhale, another filament of soot-script reaches down, touches the funnel, and again collapses into grit against the warding. The grit skitters, dry and pepper-fine, collecting in the fold like dead ash.

Halven answers your first question with a hard look that says *don’t make me say it*—then he does, because you asked for exactness.

“**OPEN. THE. LAMP.**” he whispers, each word clipped and forced through his teeth, careful not to project toward the seam. “It wrote it on wool. We burned the sleeve. The man lived. He never stopped smelling ink.”

At “lamp,” your reliquary flame gutters once—just a brief stutter, like someone pinched the wick from very far away—then steadies. Senn flinches at the flicker but keeps breathing.

You glance over your shoulder without moving your feet. Halven shifts his weight minutely and tests the patched seam with his forearm and shoulder.

“Flat-cold,” he murmurs. “No bulge. No give. But—” He pauses, listening with his bones rather than his ears. “Pressure changes when it taps. Like it’s right there, then not.”

From the seam comes a new sound: not tapping—*a slow drag*, as if a fingernail is tracing the edge of your patch. The patch itself doesn’t move, but the warded buffer sheet under Halven’s elbow darkens another shade along its margin, as though it’s being read.

Threat, now immediate and specific: whatever is behind the stitched door has stopped testing for a reply and started *studying your warding and your lamp-word*. It may be trying to provoke you into opening the lamp, or to find a way to “write through” the paper stand you’ve placed on the damp stone.

### Turn 184 [PLAYER]

I slide my satchel under the paper cradle to lift it off the ink-slick stone, then nudge the damp-touched corner into the lamp’s light until it dries and stops blooming script. “Senn, keep breathing—good, good—eyes on the flame.”

Without repeating the phrase, I murmur to Halven, “It’s baiting the lamp—don’t even think the words,” and I carefully lay a blank (unwritten) sheet over the darkening buffer by his elbow like a sacrificial cover. Then I lean close to the seam—silent—and tilt the lamp so its light washes the patch, watching for any place the “reading” concentrates or the stitching twitches.

*Agent reasoning: The floor damp is trying to “annotate” my paper stand, so I need to get the warded setup off the stone and reduce surfaces it can read. The seam is studying the warding and baiting “OPEN THE LAMP,” so I’ll avoid speaking that phrase again and strengthen the patch without giving it new text. Also keep Senn breathing and catching soot safely.*

### Turn 185 [GAME]

You slide your satchel under the paper cradle and lift it clean off the ink-slick stone. The damp-touched corner comes with it—no longer feeding on floor-wet—and when you angle it into the lamp’s glow, the cramped micro-script halo pales, then dries into a faint, scorched-looking watermark. It stops trying to “bloom.” The pepper-fine grit in the funnel stays inert.

Senn keeps breathing. His nostrils flare less on each inhale. The soot at the edge of his right nostril thins from a visible smudge to a dull shadow, as if whatever’s inside him is losing purchase when it can’t find a friendly surface. He nods once, tiny, eyes locked on the flame like it’s a metronome.

Halven’s jaw tightens at your warning. He doesn’t answer—just shifts his gaze away from your lamp, as if even looking at it feels like “thinking near” the bait.

You lay a blank sheet over the darkening buffer by his elbow. The effect is immediate and ugly: the darkening stops on the buffer beneath, but the new blank sheet starts to take it instead—its fibers drinking cold and turning gray along the edge closest to the seam. A faint indentation appears in the paper, as though invisible type is pressing from the other side. Not ink, not yet—pressure.

Then you lean in, silent, and wash the patch in lamplight.

The stitches react.

Three threads on the lower left of the patch twitch in sequence—one, two, three—like a patient finger-tap answered in thread. In the lamp’s wash you see the twitches aren’t random: they’re concentrated around a knot that wasn’t there a moment ago, a tiny puckered “eye” in the stitching that seems to drink the light rather than reflect it.

At the same time, the sacrificial blank sheet under Halven’s elbow creases by itself, forming a shallow fold that points directly at that knot—like an arrow made of paper memory.

From behind the seam comes a sound you can’t mistake now: a muffled inhale, slow and close, as if someone is breathing against cloth. The patch stays flat-cold under Halven’s pressure, but the breathing continues—testing the boundary without bulging it.

Threat, clear: the thing behind the stitched door has found a focal point (“the eye-knot”) where it can interact—reading by pressure, twitching stitches, and possibly preparing to puncture or “write through” if given enough light and blank surface.

### Turn 186 [PLAYER]

I snatch the “sacrificial” blank sheet away from Halven’s elbow and crumple it tight in my fist, then tuck it into a sealed pocket of my satchel—no more clean pages near that seam. “Halven—keep pressure, but shift your elbow off the buffer; I think it’s using the paper like a tongue.”

I tilt the lamp away so the patch falls into dimmer, indirect light, then take a pre-warded sheet and press it flat over the eye-knot without rubbing—just a firm, steady palm through the paper. In a hush I ask the seam, “Can you *hear* without writing—yes or no?” and immediately bite my tongue, glaring at myself for giving it anything at all.

*Agent reasoning: The “eye-knot” is a weak point reacting to light and blank paper; I want to map its behavior without feeding it, and protect Halven/Senn by removing writable surfaces and adding warding pressure.*

### Turn 187 [GAME]

You yank the blank sheet away. The moment it leaves the seam’s “reach,” the gray pressure-indentation vanishes from its surface—like a hand pulled back through a wall. You crumple it tight; the creases grind the faint imprint into nothing readable. When you stuff it into the sealed pocket, the paper inside your satchel gives a single, dry *tick*—as if something tried to follow and hit the seal instead.

Halven shifts exactly as told: he keeps his shoulder braced to the patch but slides his elbow off the buffer. The darkening on the buffer stops spreading immediately. He exhales once, controlled, and doesn’t look at your lamp.

You tilt the lamp away. The patch drops into dim, indirect light; the twitching threads go still. The “eye-knot” remains—puckered, wrong—but less active without the direct wash.

Then you press a pre-warded sheet over the eye-knot with a firm, steady palm.

Contact triggers a reaction anyway.

Under your hand, the knot tightens as if it’s trying to bite down on the paper. You feel a faint tug—not enough to pull the sheet away, but enough to confirm there’s *traction* there. A hairline of cold creeps into your palm through the paper, like holding winter by a glove.

When you whisper, “Can you hear without writing—yes or no?” the seam answers without words.

The stitched threads beneath your warded sheet begin to move in a deliberate pattern: two short tugs, then a long one—like a practiced signal. Your warding doesn’t let ink through, but the pressure comes through cleanly, telegraphing intent.

Halven’s eyes flick to your hand. “Moth—off. Now.” He doesn’t shout, but his voice turns sharp with fear. “It’s answering. That’s not—”

Senn inhales too fast, panic breaking his rhythm for the first time. A dark bead of soot gathers at the edge of his nostril, swelling as if encouraged by the exchange. It doesn’t fall—yet—but it’s *back*.

The threat is immediate and specific: the entity can’t write through your warding, but it **can communicate by pressure and stitch-movement**, and your question has given it a call-and-response channel. Each “answer” coincides with Senn’s soot-script reasserting itself—suggesting the thing is using him as a reservoir while it negotiates at the seam.

### Turn 188 [PLAYER]

I jerk my hand off the warded sheet and peel it away from the eye-knot in one clean motion, then fold it inward on itself twice and clamp it shut with my thumb—no exposed face toward the seam. “No more questions,” I mutter, more to me than anyone, and angle my body to block Senn’s view again.

I bring the lamp back to Senn’s face—steady, close. “Eyes here. In—out—slow,” and I tap my own sternum to set the pace, keeping the paper funnel under his nose on the satchel-stand to catch the bead if it drops.

To Halven, low and urgent: “If it answers by stitches, can we jam it—wrap the knot tight, add more thread, wax, anything? Or do we back away and let the patch go dead-cold again?”

*Agent reasoning: I accidentally opened a communication channel and it’s feeding back into Senn; I need to break contact fast, re-stabilize his breathing, and deny the seam any surfaces or attention while we regroup.*

### Turn 190 [PLAYER]

I jerk my hand off the warded sheet and peel it away from the eye-knot in one clean motion, then fold it inward twice and pinch it shut—no face toward the seam. “No more questions,” I mutter, and shift my shoulder to block Senn’s view of the patch.

I bring the lamp back close to Senn’s face. “Eyes here—breathe with me. In… out… slow,” tapping my sternum to set the pace, keeping the funnel on the satchel-stand under his nose.

To Halven, low and urgent: “If it answers by stitches, can we jam it—tighten the knot, add thread, wax—anything? Or do we back away and let the patch go dead-cold again?”

*Agent reasoning: The seam started “answering” and it flared Senn’s soot back up; I need to cut the interaction, re-stabilize Senn’s breathing with the lamp, and ask Halven for the safest way to neutralize the eye-knot without feeding it more clean paper/light.*

### Turn 191 [GAME]

You peel the warded sheet off the eye-knot in one clean pull. The instant the paper breaks contact, the knot loosens a fraction—like a jaw unclenching. No ink follows. No new pressure-letters appear. Folding it inward twice and pinching it shut works: the sheet stays inert in your grip, and the seam gives no immediate “answer” to the movement.

When you shift to block Senn’s view, his eyes—wide and glassy—lose the patch and find your lamp instead. You bring the flame close, steady. Your sternum-tap sets a rhythm he can copy.

It helps. His shoulders drop a hair. He draws in—slow—then lets it out. On the second exhale the soot-bead at his nostril swells, trembles, and finally drops.

It doesn’t fall like liquid. It *unthreads* in midair into a thin black filament, trying to climb back toward his nose.

The paper funnel catches it.

The filament hits the funnel’s rim, twitches once like a hooked worm, and then goes slack, collapsing into a small, glossy knot of soot-script at the bottom of the funnel. The air immediately smells sharper—iron and burnt paper—like a page singed at the edges.

Senn coughs once, dry, then inhales cleanly. “It—left,” he whispers, shocked. His right nostril is stained but no longer bulging with that living dark.

Halven doesn’t relax. He keeps his braced shoulder on the patch, but he leans toward you just enough to speak without turning his head.

“Jamming is a wager,” he says, voice tight. “Wax and extra thread give it *more material* to work with. Tightening a knot can turn it into a puncture point—like pulling a noose until it cuts through cloth.” He swallows. “Backing away and starving it of light and clean surface is safer—unless it’s already anchored.”

As he says “anchored,” the patch proves him half-wrong: even in dimmer light, the eye-knot gives a small, deliberate *twitch*—a single tug—aimed toward your satchel stand and the funnel.

The threat is now specific and present: whatever is behind the seam has shifted interest from “answering” to **the captured soot-knot**—and it can still signal through the stitching without direct lamplight.

### Turn 192 [PLAYER]

I slide the funnel off the satchel-stand and quickly cap it with a pre-warded sheet, folding and sealing it into a tight paper packet around the soot-knot. “Mine,” I whisper, then tuck the packet deep into my satchel between warded pages, away from the seam.

To Halven: “Back away—slow—keep your body between it and us; I don’t want it ‘watching’ the satchel.” Then to Senn, softer: “You did it. Keep breathing—can you walk?” 

As we start to withdraw, I angle the lamp down toward the floor rather than the patch, and murmur to Halven, “If it’s anchored, where—stitches, stone, or Senn? What do you think it wants the knot for?”

*Agent reasoning: The seam’s focusing on the captured soot-knot; I want to secure the sample fast, starve the seam, and also inspect what we caught without feeding it more clean surfaces.*

### Turn 193 [GAME]

You slide the funnel free and cap it with a pre-warded sheet. The moment paper meets paper, the soot-knot inside gives a single, frantic *scrape*—like a pencil tip dragged across the inside of a box—then falls quiet. You fold, fold, seal: a tight packet with no exposed opening. When you whisper “Mine,” nothing answers aloud, but the seam’s eye-knot pulls once—hard enough to make the patched cloth dimple inward—then releases.

You tuck the packet deep between warded pages. The satchel’s wards take it: the air around the flap cools, and the faint iron-burnt smell dulls as if smothered.

Halven nods once and starts the withdrawal exactly as you asked: slow steps, shoulder still toward the patch, his body a moving barricade. He keeps his ink-buffer between his palm and the cloth now, not trusting bare contact. “Don’t run,” he murmurs, more command than comfort.

Senn swallows, nods, and tests his legs. He can walk—unsteady but upright. “I can—yes. Just—don’t let me look at it.” He keeps his gaze on your lamp’s pool on the stone floor.

You angle the lamp down. The patch loses its direct feed of attention and light. For three steps, it stays merely wrong and quiet.

Then the seam reacts to the retreat.

A thin black stitch-filament—no thicker than hair—pushes out from the eye-knot and lays itself along the floor, *seeking* like a feeler. It doesn’t chase fast; it probes, tracing the direction your satchel moved, pausing when it meets a crack in the stone as if tasting it.

Halven answers your question without looking back. “Anchored in the stitching,” he says. “Stone is just a page it can write on. Senn was a wick—used, not rooted.” His voice goes flatter on the last part. “It wants the knot because it’s *its own ink returned.* If it gets it back, it can spool more. If it loses it… it has to bargain, or starve.”

As you withdraw another step, the probing filament reaches the edge of your lamp’s downcast light and recoils, not burned—*repelled*, like it recognizes Concord flame and doesn’t want to be seen in it.

The immediate threat is clear: the seam can extend **searching stitch-filaments** along surfaces to track or retrieve the packet, and it’s testing the floor for a route around Halven’s body-shield.

### Turn 194 [PLAYER]

I widen the lamp’s pool on the floor with a slow sweep, “painting” a brighter ring between us and the filament, then scuff my boot across a few cracks to smear our trail. “Halven, keep backing—stay in the light. Senn, eyes down, hand on my sleeve.”

As we move, I flick a pinch of grit from the satchel (not a clean page—just dirt) into a different crack off to the side. “Go sniff that,” I mutter under my breath, then to Halven: “If light repels it, can we mark a corridor—lanterns, chalk, anything reflective—until we find a door that isn’t stitched?”

*Agent reasoning: The stitch-filament is probing along cracks and recoils from the lamp’s edge; I want to test that boundary and confuse its tracking while keeping Senn moving.*

### Turn 195 [GAME]

You sweep the lamp low and wide, brightening the floor into a broader, steadier pool. The stitch-filament hits the edge of that light and flinches back again—more sharply this time—curling toward the patch as if retracting a tongue. It doesn’t vanish, but it stops advancing while the light stays on it.

Your boot scuffs across the cracks you’d stepped over. Grit and damp lichen smear into the seams of stone, breaking the clean “line” the filament had been following. The probing thread pauses, taps the smeared crack twice, then veers—uncertain.

Senn obeys immediately: eyes down, one hand tight on your sleeve like a child crossing ice. He keeps breathing in your pace, quieter now. “I’m here,” he whispers, as if saying it keeps him real.

You flick a pinch of plain dirt into a different crack off to the side.

The filament reacts—fast. It darts toward that crack in a sudden, eager slide, as if the grit carries your scent. It slips into the fissure and goes still.

For a heartbeat, it looks like the decoy worked.

Then the crack *answers*: a second, thinner line of black stitch rises from the fissure a few feet farther along—one you didn’t see before—like the floor had been pre-threaded. It angles toward your retreat, testing the edge of the lamp’s widened pool.

Halven swears under his breath. He keeps backing, staying in your light as ordered, but he changes his stance: he turns his cloak outward and spreads it slightly, trying to make himself a larger moving barrier between the floor-thread and your satchel. “Corridor marking helps,” he says, voice clipped. “But lanterns mean scrutiny. Chalk works until damp eats it. Reflective—mirrors, mica, polished grave-tiles—can extend your lamp without more flames.”

He glances down at the new filament and adds, “It’s learning. Or it already had more than one anchor.”

The threat is now twofold and concrete: **multiple stitch-anchors** can emerge from cracks and seams, and your decoy dirt can trigger movement—meaning the floor itself may be laced with dormant “listening” threads that wake when fed anything that carries you.

No new pages are seized, but you can hear bootsteps somewhere beyond the next bend—measured, clerical—too steady to be mourners. Warden pace.

### Turn 196 [PLAYER]

I freeze us for half a breath and sweep the lamp in a firm arc to pin both filaments at the very edge of light, then tug Halven’s sleeve and whisper, “Up—bench, plinth, anything not cracked stone,” guiding Senn with me onto the nearest raised surface.

Low, to Halven: “Wardens coming—do we trust them with ‘stitched seams’, or do we go quiet and let them pass?” I glance toward the bend, then add, “If you’ve got any mica or polished scrap, hand it over—I'll angle the lamp off it and keep a bright fence without showing the flame.”

*Agent reasoning: Wardens nearby could complicate everything, but they might also have tools like mica, mirrors, or chalk; I want to avoid the floor threads by getting off the cracks and keep the lamp controlling the filament while we decide whether to hide or intercept.*

### Turn 197 [GAME]

You freeze. The lamp swings in a firm, low arc.

Both stitch-filaments react the same way: they stop at the light’s edge as if snagged on an invisible wire. One curls back into its crack; the other flattens against the stone, trembling, unwilling to cross. The “bright fence” works—so long as you keep it steady and close.

You tug Halven and guide Senn up onto the nearest raised surface: a low sarcophagus plinth with a chipped marble lip. It’s cleaner than the floor—fewer cracks, fewer seams to hide in. Senn clambers up awkwardly, nearly slipping, but your grip on his sleeve keeps him upright. Halven steps up last, never turning his back to the floor-thread.

Below you, the filaments probe the base of the plinth, searching for a join. One finds a hairline fracture in the marble and tries to slip into it—then recoils when your lamp’s light pools there. It can’t climb into the lighted fracture, but it’s clearly *looking* for a way onto the raised stone.

From the bend ahead: bootsteps resolve into two sets, then three. Ink-caps. Chain of keys. A soft scrape of a lantern hook.

Halven leans close, voice barely above breath. “We don’t trust them with this,” he says. “Not the wrong wardens. They’ll seize your lamp and call it ‘unsafe illumination.’ And if they see Senn’s staining, they’ll quarantine him and write him into custody.”

He digs into his sleeve-cuff and produces a thin, thumb-sized shard of mica wrapped in wax paper—likely a page-protector turned to other use. He presses it into your palm. “Angle it. Keep the flame down. No direct glare.”

As he speaks, one of the approaching wardens calls around the corner, not yet seeing you: “Curfew audit. Lamps down and satchels open. Concord writ.”

The stitch-filaments below twitch at the sound, then go still—as if listening too.

**Threats, immediate and concrete:**
- The seam-thing is actively searching for a path onto the plinth via fractures and joins.
- Three Warden-Scribes are seconds away from line-of-sight; if they spot your lamp and satchel, they will attempt confiscation under curfew authority.

### Turn 198 [PLAYER]

I wrap the mica in my fingers and tilt the lamp down behind the sarcophagus lip, bouncing a hard, pale strip of light off the mica to “paint” the hairline fracture and the plinth’s base—no direct flame showing. I pull Senn down into a crouch and whisper, “Hold your breath when they pass—just a moment,” then tuck my satchel under my knee.

In a low, steady voice toward the bend (without stepping out), I call, “Audit—under whose seal? We’re sheltering from a seam-fault in the floor; you’ll want a mirror-lamp, not keys.”

*Agent reasoning: Wardens will confiscate and expose Senn; I need to stay unseen while keeping the stitch-filaments pinned. Using mica lets me redirect light as a low, indirect fence, and the sarcophagus offers concealment. I’ll also probe the wardens’ intent with a harmless-sounding call without revealing the satchel.*

### Turn 199 [GAME]

You cup the mica and drop the lamp behind the sarcophagus lip. The flame itself disappears from any straight line to the corridor, but the mica throws a hard, pallid ribbon of light down the plinth’s base like a blade laid on stone.

At once, the hairline fracture brightens—every tiny tooth of it outlined. The stitch-filament that had been nosing for purchase hits that lit seam and recoils, snapping back into the floor crack with a wet, threadlike *zip*. The other filament flattens and retreats a handspan, as if the reflected light is less “authority” than the open flame but still too exposing to cross.

Senn folds into a crouch, both hands clamped over his own mouth. His chest stills. You feel the tremor of him through your sleeve, but he holds.

Your satchel goes under your knee. The wards on it give a faint, papery resistance, like pressing down on a closed book that wants to spring open.

Your call carries around the bend. The bootsteps halt. Keys chime once, then stop.

A Warden-Scribe’s voice answers—male, controlled, trained to sound like a door closing. “Seal of Third Candle, Curfew Writ Seventeen. Step into view. Lamp and satchel visible. Now.”

A second voice—older, impatient—adds, “Mirror-lamps are contraband outside sanctioned copying rooms. You just confessed to one.”

They don’t rush you. Instead, lantern light lifts slowly on the far wall as they angle their own hooded lanterns to avoid giving you a bright target. You catch the edge of a Concord sigil on a sleeve as one leans, trying to get a sightline without fully rounding the corner.

Halven’s breath goes tight beside you. He doesn’t speak, but his posture changes: he shifts so his body blocks Senn from any direct view down the corridor.

On the floor below, the stitch-filaments go unnaturally still—then begin to slide sideways, away from your painted fracture, toward the darker side of the plinth where your reflected strip doesn’t reach. They’re not advancing at you; they’re repositioning, searching for an unlit join.

**What’s happening, plainly:**
- Your mica-reflected light successfully drives the filament out of the plinth’s hairline fracture and keeps the base “fenced” where you paint it.
- Your call stops the wardens and draws scrutiny; they now suspect you of contraband illumination and are ordering you into view.
- The seam-thing is adapting, shifting to the unlit side of the plinth to find another way up.

### Turn 200 [PLAYER]

I keep the lamp hidden and slide the mica’s pale strip around to the plinth’s darker side, “painting” the base in a slow sweep to deny the filaments a shadowed seam. Without stepping out, I call, “Third Candle then—you know what a live seam does to a writ. I’ll show hands and lamp-shade only; satchel stays shut unless your seal-bearer swears a binding against seizure and contamination.”

I press my elbow lightly into Halven’s side as a cue to stay blocking Senn, and add, quieter but firm, “And send one warden forward with a hooded lantern—no keys, no crossing the cracks—unless you want to explain to your Archivist why the floor started stitching back.”

*Agent reasoning: Wardens will confiscate if we comply, but refusing escalates; I’ll negotiate using their fear of “seam-faults,” keep Senn hidden, and keep the light-fence moving to stop the stitch-filaments from finding a dark join.*

### Turn 201 [GAME]

You rotate the mica and “walk” the pale strip of reflected light around the plinth’s base. The seam-filaments below respond immediately: each time one finds a darker join, your light catches it and it snaps back, skittering along the floor cracks like a needle searching for cloth it can bite. For the moment, neither filament manages to climb—your moving fence denies them a stable shadowed seam.

Your terms carry around the bend.

There’s a pause long enough to hear the wardens’ lantern oil whisper.

Then the controlled voice answers, colder. “You don’t dictate bindings to the Concord from behind a tomb.”

A third voice—female, younger, precise—cuts in with professional interest rather than anger: “Live seam? Describe it. Thread? Soot-script? Where’s the anchor?”

Keys jingle again; someone takes them off a belt and holds them still. You hear leather creak as a lantern is hooded further.

One warden steps into partial view at the corner—careful, as you demanded. Hooded lantern held high, light down-angled to avoid spilling into cracks. No keys visible. His free hand is open, showing empty palm. He doesn’t cross into the corridor fully; he plants his boot on a relatively unbroken flagstone and tests the next step with the lantern’s rim like a blind cane.

“I’m Seal-bearer Lute,” he says. A brass plate at his chest catches a sliver of his own lantern glow. “Hands first. Lamp-shade only. Satchel stays shut—for now.”

Behind him, the older impatient warden mutters, “This is how smugglers talk,” but he doesn’t advance.

Your mention of “the Archivist” changes their tempo. The seal-bearer’s shoulders tighten; he’s weighing bureaucratic fallout against curfew authority.

Below your plinth, the filaments stop retreating and do something worse: they sink into separate cracks and go slack, as if playing dead. A heartbeat later, a *new* thin line—fainter, almost hair-dust—begins to rise along the vertical edge of the plinth where marble meets mortar, directly beneath the sarcophagus lip. It’s using a join you can’t fully paint without exposing your lamp’s position.

Threat, clear and immediate: **a third seam-thread is climbing the plinth’s vertical join, inside the “blind spot” of your reflected strip**, and the seal-bearer is now close enough that any sudden flare of open flame or visible contraband will be seen.

### Turn 202 [PLAYER]

I raise both hands into the seal-bearer’s sightline, fingers spread, keeping my lamp hidden behind the sarcophagus lip. “Hands shown. Lamp is hooded and down—no open flame.”

Without moving my torso much, I slide a warded sheet from my satchel with my knee and, still crouched, press its edge firmly along the plinth’s mortar join under the lip—like blotting a spill—then drag it a slow inch upward to catch the climbing hair-thread. Toward the younger voice, quick and precise: “Yes—thread and soot-script. Anchor is the satchel seam; it probes cracks to climb. It recoils from Concord light and reflected glare. Do not cross cracked stone and do not bring keys near it.”

*Agent reasoning: The new thread is climbing in a blind spot; I need to stop it without revealing the flame. I’ll comply partially with the seal-bearer to keep him cooperative, while using my body and a warded page to physically block/strip the climbing thread. Also I’ll feed the curious younger warden a clear description to buy time and authority.*

I lift both hands into the seal-bearer’s view, fingers spread. “Hands shown—lamp is hooded and down, no open flame.”

Staying crouched, I work a warded sheet out with my knee and press it hard along the mortar join under the sarcophagus lip, blotting and then dragging it a slow inch upward to snag the climbing hair-thread. Toward the younger warden’s voice I say, quick and clipped: “Thread and soot-script—anchor’s in the floor cracks and it climbs seams. It recoils from Concord light and reflected glare; don’t cross cracked stone and keep keys away from it.”

*Agent reasoning: I need to keep the wardens calm while I deal with the climbing hair-thread in the blind spot; I’ll show compliance with hands, keep the lamp concealed, and use a warded sheet to “catch” the thread without flaring light.*

### Turn 205 [GAME]

Your hands rise into the corner’s sightline, fingers spread. Seal-bearer Lute answers by lifting his own empty hand higher in acknowledgment—then he shifts his hooded lantern a fraction, trying to catch the outline of your “hooded and down” lamp without flooding the floor.

He can’t see the lamp. He can see your hands.

With your knee you ease a warded sheet free. The moment the paper’s edge touches the mortar join under the sarcophagus lip, it *catches*—not like snagging on grit, but like a magnet finding a pin. The climbing hair-thread is there.

You press. The warding takes: the paper drinks the thread’s sheen. A faint, tight line of soot-script crawls across the sheet’s edge, then stops as if hitting a border it can’t cross. When you drag the sheet upward that slow inch, the hair-thread comes with it—stretching, thinning—until it gives with a tiny sound like a stitch being pulled through skin.

The severed end snaps back down into the join and vanishes.

Immediate outcome: **you successfully snag and tear the climbing seam-thread off the plinth’s vertical join, and part of it is now adhered to your warded sheet as inert soot-script.**

But the anchor below reacts. From the floor cracks at the plinth’s base, the “playing dead” filaments tense and slide—fast now, not probing—toward the corner where Lute stands. They’re not climbing the plinth anymore; they’re *redirecting*, as if your warded paper taught them this seam is hostile.

Lute sees the movement: a thin dark line skimming along a crack toward his boot.

He jerks his foot back onto the safer flagstone he tested earlier and barks, “Hold—DON’T STEP.”

Behind him, the older warden’s keys clink once in reflex. The younger voice snaps, sharp: “Stop moving the keys!”

At the single key-chime, the crack-line twitches toward the sound like a hooked fish. The filament doesn’t leap out, but it accelerates along the crack, angling for the metal.

Threat, clear: **the seam-filaments are now actively homing on metal noise—keys—and are closing on the wardens’ position via the floor cracks.** If a boot crosses a cracked stone or keys jingle again, the filament has a clear path to latch.

### Turn 206 [PLAYER]

“Keys in cloth. Now—wrap them, no clinking,” I hiss toward the bend, then to Lute, “Don’t backstep across any crack—freeze on that solid flag.”

Keeping my hands visible, I angle the mica’s reflected strip down the crack-line toward the corner to ‘paint’ its path and make it recoil, and I flick the warded sheet off the plinth like a little bridge-tab, pressing its clean edge flat over the crack between the filament and the keys. “You—scribe,” I call to the younger voice, “have you seen seams home on metal before, or is this new?”

*Agent reasoning: The seam is homing on metal sound; I should stop the keys, warn them, and use reflected light/warded paper to divert or pin the filament without exposing the lamp. Also I want to keep questioning the wardens—especially the younger one—about what they know of live seams.*

### Turn 207 [GAME]

Your hissed order lands before the next reflexive jingle can happen.

From behind Lute, there’s a hurried scuff on stone and the sound of cloth being yanked—someone stuffs the keyring into a sleeve or kerchief. The older warden snarls something under his breath, but the metal noise dies to a muffled, soft thud.

Lute obeys your second instruction exactly: he freezes on the intact flagstone, knees bent, lantern still hooded and held high. His eyes don’t leave the crack at his toes.

You tilt the mica. The reflected strip drops cleanly into the crack-line like poured milk. The filament reacts at once: the dark line flattens, then *withdraws* a finger’s breadth, shivering along the fissure as if the light were a fingertip pressing it back.

You flick the warded sheet down as a bridge-tab and pin its clean edge over the crack between the filament’s tip and where the keys were. The paper adheres with a faint tacky pull—warding taking hold. The filament tests the paper’s edge, touches it, and recoils sharply, retreating another few inches down the crack. It doesn’t dissolve, but it can’t cross the warded barrier.

Outcome, plain: **you force the seam-filament to back off with reflected glare and successfully block its approach with the warded sheet. The wardens’ keys stop drawing it once muffled.**

The younger voice answers you from the bend; you hear her step once—carefully—then stop. “This is new,” she says, clipped and certain. “Seams home on *heat* and *ink*, not metal. Unless—” She swallows the rest, then calls to Lute: “Seal-bearer, that’s not a normal seam. That’s a *finder-stitch*. Someone trained it.”

Lute’s jaw tightens. He doesn’t argue; he shifts his hooded lantern a fraction toward the warded sheet, not to burn brighter but to see its placement. “Quillwhisper,” he says, voice low now, “keep that reflection on it. Don’t let it slip past your paper.”

Consequence emerging: the filament’s retreat isn’t random—it’s rerouting. You can see the crack-line’s dark tip angle away from the warded sheet, searching for another branch in the stonework. **Threat:** if it finds an unblocked side-crack that leads around your paper (or if your reflected strip wavers), it can come at the wardens from a different seam—and you’ll have less warning.

### Turn 208 [PLAYER]

“Finder-stitch,” I echo, tasting the term. “Trained by who—Concord, Archivist, or a private hand? What does it *find*—ink, names, blood?”

I keep the mica’s strip steady on the main crack, then, without lifting my torso into view, I tear a narrow ribbon from another warded sheet in my satchel and slide it out along the floor with two fingers, aiming to lay it across the nearest branching hairline like a second little dam. “Lute—can you see any side-cracks splitting off left or right of my barrier? Tell me where, by finger-width, and I’ll patch them.”

*Agent reasoning: A trained finder-stitch is a bigger mystery; I want to learn who trained it while also preventing it from rerouting. I’ll ask the younger scribe for details and try to map/plug side cracks with warded paper without exposing Senn or my lamp.*

### Turn 209 [GAME]

“Finder-stitch,” the younger scribe repeats, and you hear ink-stained fingers worrying a rosary-bead of wax somewhere in the dark. “Not Concord craft. Concord wards *repel*—they don’t hunt. An Archivist could design the *theory*, but this feels… field-trained.”

She answers your second question like she hates that she knows it. “It finds *reference points*. Things that ‘belong’ in a record: signatures, true names, blood that’s been written into oath-ledgers. And—” a pause, “—lamp-oil that’s been blessed and catalogued.”

At that, Lute’s knuckles whiten around his hooded lantern handle.

You keep the mica strip steady on the main crack. With your other hand you tear a narrow ribbon from a fresh warded sheet—paper fibers resist, then give with a dry, clean rip—and you slide the ribbon out along the floor.

It moves smoothly for a handspan… then stops dead against something you can’t see.

Not stone. Not grit.

The ribbon’s edge *sticks* as if it’s kissed pitch. A hair-fine line rises from the hairline branch—so thin it’s almost nothing—touches the ribbon, and tries to climb it the way it was climbing the plinth seam.

The warding holds, but you’ve learned something important by accident: **there was already a second filament in the branch crack, waiting, and it will test anything you feed into that fissure.**

Lute leans his head just enough to sight along the floor without moving his feet. “Left,” he says, voice tight. “Two finger-widths left of your paper-tab—there’s a split. And—gods—another one right, closer to me. One finger-width off my toe. Don’t—don’t make me step.”

As he speaks, the main filament you’ve been painting with mica slackens, then slides backward, *away* from the reflection—only to angle toward that left split Lute indicated, seeking a route around your first warded barrier.

Clear threat: **the finder-stitch is now attempting to bypass your primary dam via the left branch, while a second, thinner filament is already active in the branch where your ribbon caught. If either finds an unwarded seam past your patches, it can reach Lute (and any muffled metal, lamp, or catalogued oil) from underneath.**
