Rain ticks through a cracked grating overhead, and each bell toll above makes the brick under your palm shiver. The air tastes of ash and sugared myrrh, and lanternlight turns warding nails into thin lines of gold.\n\nYou kneel on the third step from the bottom, where the Crown’s “safe route” marker should be. Your slate board rests on your thigh; you set a compass pin into mortar and drag chalk in a careful arc, counting the pull of the hex-line the way you learned to count footsteps in soot-sweet alleys. When the saints’ niches are quiet, you work faster. Tonight they aren’t. Stone mouths whisper in grit-soft syllables as you ink the curve with thorn-black.\n\nThe bell tolls again, and your chalk circle jerks a thumb’s breadth to the left—wrong. Your ward-sigil flares, then steadies, as if it had to catch its breath. In the lantern’s edge you see it: beneath the official lattice you were ordered to retrace, a **second grid** shows for a heartbeat, stitched in a precise hand you recognize from your apprenticeship—your own—then vanishes as the ward settles. Footsteps scrape above. A man in Crown leathers descends with the careful pace of someone who knows stairs can bite. His cloak is pinned with a thorn-brooch, but the pin is upside down—an old field sign for *unofficial orders*. He stops two steps above you, close enough that his gloved hand can reach your slate.\n\n“Cartographer Thistledown,” he says, voice low. “Senior Warden Brann wants your draft before dawn. No copies. No annotations. And—” His eyes flick to the saint niche beside you, where the statue’s lips are stained with candle soot. “—if you’ve heard the name **St. Vellum** tonight, you didn’t.”\n\nAnother toll rolls through the stone. Your compass needle swings toward the crypt door—toward a route your map says is sealed.\n\nThe man extends his hand for your slate while the hex-line keeps drifting under your knees. You have seconds to decide what you hand over, and what you follow.",

His jaw tightens at the delay, but he doesn’t snatch; instead he shifts his stance to block the stairwell behind him, cutting off the view from above.\n\nYour palm closes around the compass pin. The needle doesn’t merely “strain”—it **tugs** hard enough that you feel it through the metal, dragging its point toward the sealed crypt door at the foot of the stairs. With the next bell toll, it snaps a few degrees farther, as if the door itself just moved closer.\n\nAt your question, the man answers too quickly, like he’s repeating a line he was given. “The lattice,” he says. Then, after a beat, quieter: “And the drift—only insofar as it makes the lattice look unreliable. Brann wants a clean map. The kind you can swear on in a hearing.”\n\nYour murmur to the saint niche earns you an immediate response—no gentle whisper, but a dry scrape like grit under teeth. The statue’s stone lips don’t move, yet the words come out from the niche-shadow beside its throat.\n\n“PLAINLY,” it rasps, and then, with a strange tenderness that doesn’t belong in stone: “THE SAFE ROUTE IS A LIE THEY PRACTICE.”\n\nThe escort flinches at the voice despite himself. His eyes flick to the niche, then back to you, and his hand goes to the short baton at his belt—not drawn, but ready. “Don’t,” he warns, as if you made the statue speak on purpose. “If it starts naming things, I’m obliged to report—”\n\nA soft click interrupts him: down at the crypt door, the iron seal ring shifts. Not opened—just **settling**, metal on metal, like something on the other side leaned its weight against it.\n\nThe threat is clear now: the drifting hex-lines are actively pulling toward that sealed door, and the seal is beginning to respond.\n\nThe escort extends his hand again, firmer. “Slate. Now. We leave this stairwell.”\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Vellumcrypt Passage\"],\"npcs_add\":[{\"name\":\"Crown Escort (unnamed)\",\"faction\":\"Crown of Thorns\",\"notes\":\"Assigned to retrieve Eirwen’s draft; wearing an upside-down thorn-brooch indicating unofficial orders.\"},{\"name\":\"St. Vellum (statue-saint)\",\"faction\":\"Cathedral of Moonbriar\",\"notes\":\"Whispers from a niche; reacts when addressed; claims the safe route is a practiced lie.\"}]}",

You still manage a mark: a smear of chalk and grime, angled the way the compass yanked, but it’ll wash out with one rain-slick sleeve.\n\nAt the niche, St. Vellum answers in a single sentence, exactly as you asked—flat, unornamented, and ugly in its certainty:\n\n“THE DANGER IS THE MAP THAT MAKES THE DOOR OPEN.”\n\nThe escort’s head snaps toward the statue. “That’s enough.” He doesn’t draw his baton; instead he takes a small brass whistle from his collar and squeezes it once—silent to your ears, but the air in the stairwell tightens like a drawn thread.\n\nDown at the crypt door, the seal ring shifts again—this time not a settling click, but a slow, deliberate rotation, as if fingers on the far side are testing the shape of the lock through the metal. A thin line of pale dust sifts from the seam and falls in a steady sprinkle, making a faint crescent on the stone threshold.\n\nYou rise slowly. The escort nods once at your condition, but he doesn’t “lead” so much as herd: he steps up only two stairs, keeping his body between you and the upper landing while leaving your sightline to the ring open. His eyes never leave your hands now.\n\n“Third step,” he repeats, tight-lipped. “Fine. We back out. Quietly.

The escort watches you do it, then flicks his gaze to the mark you left. For the first time he looks genuinely uncertain—less about you, more about what he’s been told to contain.\n\n“Brann’s,” he answers softly. “Not Cathedral. Cathedral doesn’t come down like that.”\n\nBootsteps hit the upper landing: three, maybe four people, moving in practiced spacing. Lanternlight spills down the stairwell in a hard white fan. A voice follows—female, clipped, official.\n\n“Hold position. Hands visible. No one approaches the door.”\n\nTwo Crown wardens appear at the top of the stairs in thorn-leathers with ward-sashes. Behind them is a senior figure in a dark coat with a silver-thorn clasp. Her gaze goes straight past you to the crypt seal ring, as if she’s been listening to it for hours.\n\nAt your last line—*whose hand is holding the pen*—the escort’s mouth tightens. He doesn’t answer. He can’t, or won’t.\n\nThe seal ring below turns another fraction—enough that the old engraved prayer on it slides out of alignment. A faint sound comes through the seam now: not speech, not a growl—more like a slow inhale through teeth, patient and testing. The pale dust at the threshold lifts in a tiny spiral, as if drawn inward.\n\nThe senior warden raises her left hand. One of the wardens produces a coil of thorn-iron chain with chalk-sealed links.\n\n“We’re sealing the stair,” she says. “Cartographer Thistledown, you’re coming upstairs.

The senior warden’s eyes flick down the stairwell to the crypt ring, then to the chain, doing the same arithmetic you are.\n\n“Hold,” she says, curt. The coil stops moving.\n\nYou reach her. Up close, she smells of camphor and wet iron. Her silver-thorn clasp bears a small notch pattern—rank marks you’ve seen on hearing-room wardens.\n\nYou keep your voice low; she answers at the same volume, without leaning in.\n\n“Warden-Seneschal Maudlin Kest,” she says. “Crown of Thorns. Authority: Civic Ward Integrity Act, subsection seven—emergency containment.”\n\nAt your question—written order or unofficial—her gaze goes to your escort’s upside-down thorn-brooch, then back to you. It’s a glance that lands like a verdict.\n\n“I’m acting on my own signature,” Kest says. “Brann’s name is a corridor people get lost in.”\n\nBehind her, one of the wardens takes a half-step to block the stairwell mouth, positioning to keep you from looking down.

The junior warden swaps tools: instead of the thorn-iron chain, he produces a small clay puck stamped with a ward-sigil and presses it to the stone at the stairwell edge. It sticks with a wet *thunk*.\n\nA thin, translucent film—like cooled breath—begins to stretch across the stairwell opening behind you, forming a barrier that will block sound and sight *without* physically jarring the steps.\n\nDown below, the crypt ring turns again—slower now, as if feeling the new ward settle overhead—then pauses.

No prayers. No sudden turns.”\n\nHe gestures without looking away. Two Crown wardens step in close—one on each side—gloved hands settling on your shoulders with practiced firmness. Not rough, but immovable. Their thumbs find the seam where collarbone meets cloak, anchoring you as if you’re a cart they mean to keep from rolling.\n\nKest continues, “Your slate: I choose to read.”\n\nThe escort—still hooded—produces your slate from inside the cloak as if it had been there all along. He holds it flat in both hands, angled so you can see the surface but not touch it. A thin strip of pale material—Crown-issued correction vellum—peeks from his sleeve like a tongue.\n\nKest steps closer and begins reading aloud, line by line, voice steady.\n\nHe gets through your last clean measurements—then pauses on a segment where the chalk is smudged, as if a fingertip tested it. He looks up at you for the first time.\n\n“‘Second lattice under official grid… stitched in a hand I recognize…’” He stops before the name you would have written. The escort’s thumb shifts, just barely, as if ready to lay that correction strip down.\n\nThe wardens guide you forward to the edge. The film is now a visible skin across the stair-mouth: oil-sheen colors, trembling with each distant toll. Up close it doesn’t look like glass; it looks like a membrane that wants to breathe you.\n\nAs your boots reach the lip, the film dimples inward toward you—responding to your presence—then tightens, like it’s deciding whether to admit you or reflect you.\n\nYou have your sixty seconds. If you lean into the edge, you’ll be within a breath of the film; if you pull back, Kest’s reading continues and the escort’s correction strip is poised to touch your slate.",

Each tick coincides with a distant bell-note—half a heartbeat after the sound arrives through stone. It isn’t dampening anything. It’s *listening*, then responding.\n\nA thin backflow ripples outward from the dimple—away from you, down the stair-mouth—like the film is pushing an answer into the ward-lines below.\n\nKest doesn’t finish your line.\n\nHe keeps his voice even, but he switches tracks mid-sentence as if the words have become officially unfit to exist in air. “—stitched in a hand you *claim* to recognize,” he reads, and the phrasing is wrong; you can hear the bureaucratic edge of it, the way an affidavit rewrites a witness.\n\nThe escort’s thumb moves.\n\nNot to place vellum—yet—but to *cover* the next word on the slate with the pad of his glove. He does it casually, like adjusting grip. The pale correction strip remains poised, still clean.\n\n“You will not threaten a Crown chain-of-custody while standing on an active boundary,” Kest says, quiet. “You will observe. You will report. You will not dictate procedure.”\n\nThe wardens’ hands tighten on your shoulders. One of them—left side—leans close enough that you feel his breath anyway. “Time,” he murmurs, counting under his tongue.\n\nAt the edge, the film reacts to that warm exhale: the dimple deepens sharply, as if tasting. A hair-thin filament unspools from the membrane toward your throat—no thicker than a spider strand, shining oil-blue.\n\nIt doesn’t touch you yet.\n\nBut it’s reaching, and if it makes contact, it’s close enough to snag skin or breath and pull *something* through the boundary with it.",

It skims your collar and catches on a single hair near your nape. For an instant it tenses, drawing a pinprick of cold along your skin, as if testing for purchase.\n\nThen the left warden—breath still held in his chest now—brings his forearm up between you and the stair-mouth. The filament touches his sleeve instead. It clings.\n\nThe membrane dimples hard, as if satisfied, and the hair-thin line thickens to the width of twine. It begins to reel, pulling on the warden’s arm with a steady, patient force—not a jerk, but a *tow*. His shoulder yanks forward a fraction. Leather creaks. His boots slide a finger’s breadth toward the lip.\n\n“Cut it,” the right warden barks, reaching for a knife that isn’t there—Crown protocol near boundaries forbids exposed steel unless ordered.\n\nKest lifts one hand sharply. “Hold. Do not sever without my word.”\n\nHe steps in, finally looking at the film rather than you. “Your observation stands,” he says, clipped. “It responds to breath and bell.”\n\nAt your accusation, his gaze flicks to the slate.

The correction vellum is still clean, but now it’s obvious what it’s for.\n\nKest doesn’t seal it under *your* mark.\n\n“Chain-of-custody is mine,” he says. “Escort—fold it. Bind it.”\n\nThe escort produces a black waxed cord from within the cloak and begins wrapping the slate with quick, competent turns, pinning your writing out of sight. He does it in front of you—deliberately—without reading the covered word aloud.\n\nMeanwhile the left warden grits his teeth as the tether tightens. The pull increases by degrees, syncing to the bell’s after-beat. With each distant toll, the line gives a small, inexorable tug—trying to walk him back to the edge.\n\nThe immediate threat is clear: if the tether isn’t neutralized, the warden will be dragged to the lip, and whatever the membrane is “admitting” will have an anchored path into your landing.",

Your palm buzzes as if you’ve pressed it to a plucked wire. The scarf fibers lift in tiny, frantic hairs. The line doesn’t care that it’s muffled; it cares that it’s *touched*. Where the cloth compresses it, the tether swells, thickening another fraction, and the pull resumes—steadier, more confident, as though now it has a better grip.\n\n“Brace!” you snap.\n\nBoth wardens obey. The right one hooks an elbow around the left warden’s belt and leans back, heels digging into the gritty stone. The tether draws taut; the left warden’s shoulder jerks forward a full handspan—then stops as the two bodies counterweight. Their held breath shows in their throats, not their mouths.\n\nKest reacts late, but he reacts. He turns his head and lifts a flat hand. “Silence. No speech. No breath toward the boundary.”\n\nThe escort, mid-wrap on the slate, pauses—then deliberately exhales through his nose anyway, a thin, quiet stream. It’s small. It’s enough.\n\nThe membrane at the stair-mouth dimples deeper, and the “oil” film puckers into a shallow funnel aligned with the tether. The twine-line pulls again on the bell’s after-beat, and this time it drags the left warden’s boot sole to the very edge—stone grit spilling over into the film like sand into ink.\n\nBehind the hanging ward-cloak on the landing wall, something answers the bell as well.\n\nA faint metallic *chime-chatter* wakes in the brick: thorn-iron warding nails, driven in a crescent “smile” around a hairline crack, begin to vibrate in place. The cloak’s hem flutters though there’s no wind. From the nails comes a low chorus, not words, but the sense of many small mouths humming in agreement.\n\nThe new threat is immediate and physical: the tether is now anchored and synchronized to the bell, actively hauling the left warden into the membrane, while the awakened ward-nails behind you are starting to resonate—if they fully “sing,” they’ll reinforce the boundary’s pull and make the landing itself unsafe to stand on.",

He’s already moving.\n\nHe steps in behind the escort and snaps the man’s chin up with two fingers, then jams a folded strip of his own sleeve-cloth between the escort’s teeth and ties it off with a quick, ugly knot. The escort tries to bite through it, cheeks bulging with a muffled curse. Kest’s voice is flat. “You breathe when I let you.”\n\nThe escort’s earlier deliberate exhale stops. The film at the stair-mouth loses a little of its eager funnel-shape—still pulling, but less *hungry*. The tether’s vibration under your scarf remains, synced to the bell’s after-beat, but it no longer gets that extra “push” from warm breath.\n\nYour chalk-dust arcs in a pale burst over the landing wall.

The crack behind the cloak darkens as the chalk clings to something damp and slightly oily in the brick.\n\nConsequence: the ward-cloak’s hem stops fluttering wildly, but the crack itself becomes the new problem.

He waits—still as a nail—through the bell’s main note.\n\nThen the after-beat hits.\n\nHe hauls *hard*, straight back, just as you ordered. The tether snaps taut; the left warden’s boot sole scrapes free of the lip with a gritty rip, and his whole body jerks backward into the landing. His shoulder dislocates with a wet pop that you feel through the line more than hear. He screams into your hand, muffled and panicked, but he’s *out* of the film.\n\nThe danger shifts, not gone: the tether, denied its prey, whips sideways on the after-beat and slaps toward the wall—aiming for the chalk-fouled nails and the widening crack, trying to re-anchor to something that’s still “singing.”",

Chalk inside the pouch puffs in tiny bursts with each pulse, leaking a pale seam out from under your sole.\n\nThat seam draws attention.\n\nThe widening crack behind the ward-cloak “breathes” toward it—cold air threading straight to the chalk dust as if it’s scent. The crack doesn’t open wide, but its edge darkens and *slicks*, and a thin soot-filament extrudes from the brick like a cautious tongue, reaching for the chalk-streak under your boot.\n\nKest moves the instant you speak. He doesn’t have wax—his hands go to iron. He hooks a pry-knife under the first humming nail and rips. The nail comes free with a shriek of metal on brick… and the hum jumps into the knife for a heartbeat, making the blade sing. Kest flinches, drops the knife, and the sound dies as it clatters.\n\nThe second nail resists. He yanks harder; it tears out with a wet snap, not dry—something fibrous clings to its shank like black tendon. The moment it’s free, the stair-mouth’s film *shivers* and thins, as if deprived of a tuning fork.\n\nBut the soot-filament from the crack reacts instead—jerking toward the nail in Kest’s fist.\n\n“Drop it,” you hear the uninjured warden rasp, and he grabs the dislocated one by the belt and collar as ordered. He drags him back one pace—slow, controlled. The injured man bucks once under your forearm, eyes wild, then goes slack with a strangled sob.\n\n“Strap—strap it,” the uninjured warden says through clenched teeth. He fumbles for a leather strap at his own waist, hands shaking, and starts binding the dislocated arm tight to the man’s ribs.\n\nKest swears under his breath and flings the second nail away from the wall. It skitters across the landing stones, leaving a faint dark smear. The soot-filament snaps after it—stretching thin, then recoiling back toward the strongest remaining “signal” on the landing:\n\nthe chalk-pouch under your heel.\n\nThe threat is immediate and physical now: a soot-thread is reaching from the widening crack toward the chalk leaking from under your boot, trying to find purchase on the pinned tether.",

As you score the crescent, the gouge flashes cold and bright—iron arguing with whatever warmth is breathing under the stair.

He yanks his cloak up over his own mouth and shoves a spare glove into one warden’s hands; the other warden tears a strip from their sleeve with their teeth before Kest slaps it away and forces the cloth over their lips. “No teeth,” he hisses. “No tongue.”\n\nAt the stair-mouth, the nail gives a second *ping*—fainter, as if the sound is happening one step lower than it should.

You feel it in your molars like a distant organ note.\n\nThen the corridor “shape” tightens into something more specific: a *gap* the size of a shoulder, the impression of a door that opens only when someone stands alone and thinks of a particular face.

The sound is ugly and loud in the tight brick throat.\n\nThe dimple pauses, as if startled.\n\nThen, in response to the noise, the shimmer changes tactics: it doesn’t push up anymore. It slides sideways along the underside of your chalk threshold, searching for an edge—an end to the line, a gap, a place where “no crossing” becomes “around.”\n\nYou can see it now by what it does to the dust: a moving absence, a thumb-sized void traveling left along the lip, hugging the chalk like a thief hugging a wall.\n\nThreat, clear and immediate: whatever is at the stair-mouth cannot comfortably pass iron, can press and test chalk, and is now trying to **bypass your threshold by slipping around it** rather than breaking through.\n\nYour compass hand tingles—faint numbness in the fingertips that held the iron point closest to the shimmer—like you dipped them in cold ash.",

The handspan gap stays fixed, trembling under his weight.\n\nYou get two fingers onto the cord where it rides the door edge and peel it up, trying to lift it out of the hooked tool’s reach. The chalk paste makes it slippery; the cord shifts… and the sawing outside immediately follows the movement, scraping higher like it can *feel* the tension line.\n\nThen it hooks the cord cleanly.\n\nA hard jerk from the other side yanks the cord down across the edge again. The fibers rasp once—sharp as tearing cloth—\n\n—and the cord **parts**.\n\nFor half a heartbeat the door tries to spring wider. Kest catches it with his whole shoulder and a boot heel braced against the threshold. The gap widens maybe a finger, no more, then holds—Kest shaking with the strain.\n\nYou don’t have time to mourn the cord. You reach in and work the chain.\n\nUp close, you see the wall-hook inside isn’t just a hook: it’s a **ring-bolt** set into the stone, with the chain permanently captive through it. That’s why it wouldn’t come out. You can’t “re-seat” it so much as choose how it’s routed.\n\nYou thread the chain tighter around the inner handle, then back toward the ring-bolt, shortening it link by link. Your fingertips burn as the links grind. You find a link that will catch on the ring-bolt’s lip and you **jam** it there—making a crude iron loop that holds the door at roughly the same handspan.\n\nOutcome: the door is now leashed by **iron only**. No cord crosses the edge anymore.\n\nConsequence: the moment the cord snaps, the hooked tool outside loses its purchase and switches tactics. Metal scrapes the door seam, searching for a gap to pry. The sound is louder than before.\n\nThe blotted floor joint nearest the wall lifts more than a hair—enough that you see a thin black line open and a puff of old dust breathe out.\n\nThe crouched warden finally speaks, tight and low: “Joint—two fingers from the wall. It’s opening.”\n\nFrom inside the passage, the stitched-mouth saint’s wire twitches. The whisper comes out pressed flat, like someone speaking through fabric: “Iron…holds…until it doesn’t.”\n\nAnd outside the door, the prying stops.\n\nSomething heavy settles its weight against the oak—quiet, patient pressure—followed by a soft, deliberate **tap** directly on the latch-side, as if it’s measuring where to break you next.  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[\"Thin cord\"],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}",

Stone grinds on metal, and the seam’s lift stalls—held at a hairline instead of widening.

Not words—an intake of grit, like a throat clearing.

His eyes never leave the soot-break at the hatch corner.\n\nYou twist the remaining dry linen into a long, soft cord—more rope than plug—and feed it forward along the floor. It glides over the grit with only a faint whisper, disappearing into the dim toward the hatch’s lifted corner.\n\n**Outcome:** the linen cord reaches the gap. When you press down with the flat of your gloved hand (still behind your crescent), the cord bunches and **seats under the lifting corner**, stuffing the seam. The hatch corner drops back down a fraction—enough that the visible dark line narrows to almost nothing.\n\nFor half a second, the “pull” under the hatch falters. Your tell-line stops shivering.\n\nThen the consequence hits: whatever is behind the hatch doesn’t give up—it **bites the plug**.\n\nThe cord jerks, not outward, but *sideways* as if something hooked it from the other side and dragged.

A heartbeat later the outside presence tests again—one strong, silent surge. The door bows inward a finger’s width and stops. The chain goes bar-tight with a dull, muffled *thud* against its cloth wrap. Kest holds.\n\n**Threat, clear and immediate:** something behind the service hatch is now **actively pulling on the linen jam** and trying to lever the corner open while it feeds on the airflow you’ve denied elsewhere.

The chalk hisses faintly where it meets the paste, as if the mixture is drinking it. The slick ring forms a greasy boundary that immediately changes the feel of the tug: the hooked pull at the heel becomes less “sure,” more skittering.\n\n“One… two… now.”\n\nThe boot warden twists his heel **inward**.\n\nThere’s a sharp, wet **scrape**—like something with teeth losing purchase on leather. For a heartbeat it feels like it’s going to catch again, and then the hook **slips**.\n\nThe warden’s boot jerks, but Kest and the other warden keep him pinned; no lift, no upward give. The hatch surges in anger—hard enough to jar your knee—then stalls under your combined weight.\n\nFrom the gap around the boot, something pale and jointed—two finger-length **barbs**—rakes blindly, smearing paste and chalk into streaks. One barb catches the boot’s outer edge and tears off a **small strip of leather**, but doesn’t re-hook the heel.\n\nThe immediate outcome: the heel is **free of the hook**, and the hatch stays shut.\n\nThe consequence: the thing below has found the paste-ring’s edge and is now **scratching at it**, testing where the slick ends. Each rake makes a dry, chalk-eating sound, and the cord beneath your knife gives a sudden, deliberate **downward jerk**—not enough to snap it, but enough to warn you it’s still being held.\n\nKest, teeth bared, keeps the warden pinned. “Heel’s clear. Don’t you move.”\n\nThe boot warden is breathing in short, panicked pulls, but he hasn’t lost his foot. Yet.\n\nNo new items change hands.",

Your knees feel the difference: the hatch stops micro-shivering.\n\nThen he smears more of the pale paste over the lip, working fast with the edge of his palm. The paste immediately darkens where it touches the stone—soaking in like thirsty chalk. He grabs chalk and drags a broad, ugly ring around the hatch seam.\n\nThe chalk line doesn’t sit still.\n\nAs he completes the circle, the line **crawls** a finger’s width toward the far-right edge—pulled, as if by a tide.

The door stays pinned under his shoulder; he doesn’t shift an inch.\n\nThe free warden grabs a rack slat, hooks it under the creeping bead, and scrapes. The syrup doesn’t smear like oil—it **strings**, reluctant, as if it wants to stay connected to the pipe. He keeps the slat angled up, lifts the stringy mass into a waiting wad of paste, and folds paste over it like a cap. The paste darkens where it touches, as if bruising.\n\nHe lays your “moat”: a second paste ring around the first chalk collar, thicker and uneven on purpose. He dusts chalk into the outer edge until it’s pale and readable.\n\nThe seep tries again almost immediately. A new bead appears at the glassy patch’s edge and creeps outward—hits the inner ring, hesitates, then slides along it clockwise, **testing**. It does not cross the moat yet. You can see its preference: it keeps returning to the same point near the iron shim, where metal meets stone.\n\nKest passes you his knife without taking his eyes off the passage door. “Don’t drop it,” he murmurs. “If we start cutting hinges, we’re committing.”\n\nYou press your ear to the hatch seam. The vibration you felt before is steadier now—like a slow rub against the underside of the metal, searching for the thinnest part.\n\nThen the scratching comes again from beyond the hatch.\n\nNot a circle. Not a straight line.\n\nA **circle** starts—half-formed—then stops. A pause. Then a **straight line** is dragged hard, long enough to squeal. Then another line crosses it at an angle.\n\nAn X.\n\nThe trapped warden is either being forced, interrupted, or no longer the only one answering.\n\nRight after the X, something on the far side makes a sound that is not a voice, but tries to use one: a wet click and a shallow inhale that **matches the rhythm** of your breathing for two beats… then gets it wrong, too long on the exhale, like it’s learning you.\n\nThe hatch seam twitches again under your weight—more insistently this time—and a faint metallic tick answers from the hinge side, as if pressure is being applied where you’d least want it.\n\nIf it pushes hard enough, it won’t need to lift the hatch; it can **shear** something—hinge, latch, or your balance—at the weakest point.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"Kest's knife\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}",

The hatch flexes upward… and stops dead against the strap. Leather creaks. The rack post gives a tiny, audible *tick* as it takes load. The hatch doesn’t lift, but the force redirects: the metal **grinds** sideways a fraction, trying to walk out from under the strap rather than up through it.\n\n“Strap’s holding,” Kest says, voice clipped.\n\nThe free warden drops to the pipe base and does exactly what you said: he packs paste over the shim/stone junction, building a blunt mound with no corners, then dusts it thick with chalk until it’s pale and matte. He redraws the moat wider at that point, making a fat chalked berm.\n\nThe syrup reacts like it’s offended. A thin thread that had been worrying the junction hits the new mound and doesn’t cross—yet—but it **climbs** the paste a hair’s breadth, leaving a dark stain that spreads slowly through the chalk like ink in wet paper.\n\nThen, from under the hatch, the scraping starts again—fast, desperate. Not random this time: a cluster right beneath the hinge-side weak point, exactly where the strap is biting down.\n\nAnd over it, another sound: a slow, careful rub of something hard against the underside of the hatch, as if aligning a tool—or a tooth—against the stressed seam.\n\nThe next shove comes coordinated with that rub. The hatch bucks once, sharply. The strap holds, but the rack post bends just enough to make the strap **slip a finger-width** along the hatch edge. Not free—just displaced.\n\nKest’s head snaps to the strap. “It moved,” he says immediately, as promised. He shifts his stance to brace the rack with his shoulder while keeping the door pinned with his hip—an awkward split, but he manages it.\n\nThe threat is clear and immediate: whatever is below has figured out the weak point and is now trying to **walk the hatch out from under the strap** by grinding it sideways, not lifting it. If it gains another inch, the strap won’t be over the hinge-side stress point anymore—and the next shove could pop the seam.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Rack post anchor point (by hatch)\"],\"npcs_add\":[]}",

Not random battering: **someone or something is now working the latch hardware**, trying to defeat it instead of the hinge.\n\nKest’s head snaps a fraction toward the latch end, but his body stays braced. “It’s switching ends,” he says. “If that latch goes, your blister won’t matter.”\n\nThe free warden freezes mid-hammer. “We don’t have a second strap long enough,” he says, eyes on the latch side. “Not unless we sacrifice the rack brace.”\n\nNothing has opened yet. The immediate threat is clear and present: the attacker below is actively attempting to **pick/knock the latch free** while you’re weighted over the hinge-side blister, and your current restraint system is centered on preventing hinge-side peel—not a latch release.",

The latch can’t rise without lifting the whole crossbar, and the crossbar is pinned by stone.\n\nConsequence: the pipe-cribbing is now partially cannibalized.

Anything to stop it walking.”\n\nTo the free warden, through clenched teeth: “Wedge it now—drive shims at both ends of that hinge-plank, fast.

It doesn’t *seal* it, but it makes a rough, biting plug.\n\nBelow, Mark doesn’t answer with words—just stone-scrape and breath. Something thin and hard rasps upward inside the hinge channel: not a nail (too blunt), more like a snapped sliver of thorn-iron nail or a shard of chisel-bit. He wedges it up with a trembling persistence.\n\nThe free warden moves fast. He drops to one knee on the clean stone, reaches into the rack debris, and finds two crude shims—broken wedge-like slats. He drives one at the top end of the hinge-plank with the heel of his palm, then the other at the bottom with a quick, brutal punch. The plank bites tighter into place with a dull *thunk-thunk*.\n\nHe grabs the looped chain from the wall-hook and wraps it around the plank and the nearest rack upright, then hauls it taut. The chain links squeal against wood; he braces and pulls until his knuckles go white. It’s not elegant, but it clamps the plank hard enough that the hinge edge can’t flex outward easily.\n\nOn the other side, the force changes immediately: the lifting attempt becomes a furious, upward *ratcheting* at the hinge pin.\n\nKest barks, “COUNT FOUR—PIN—PIN!” at the exact moment the top of the hinge pin rises a finger’s breadth—then stops dead with a sharp *ting* as Mark’s jam catches it.\n\nThe door bucks once, heavy and frustrated, sending a shock through your ribs and shoulder. The pin doesn’t rise further—but the jammed metal inside the hinge channel grinds, and you hear Mark hiss in pain as whatever he’s using bites into his hand.\n\nThen a new sound: a thin, wet *snick* at the keyhole area, like something flexible being slipped in where the packed cloth is—testing, probing for a gap.\n\nThe hinge is held for now. The threat has shifted: they’re no longer winning with leverage, and are trying to defeat the keyhole pack with something narrow and slick.",

It turns the edge into a gritty paste. On the other side, the slick probe (wire or something coated) slides in another fraction—then *catches*. You hear a faint, irritated tugging, and the probe withdraws with a dry, sandpapery scrape.\n\nThe wardens take your cue. The free one tears a strip off the dry linen cloth (already in the room) and wraps it around the end of the iron chisel like a crude swab. He dips the cloth into dust and rack-splinters, then rams the cloth-wrapped tip toward the keyhole pack without putting fingers near it.\n\nThe result is immediate: the keyhole area makes a muffled *crunch* as grit compacts into the cloth and jambs the narrow opening. The slick probe tries again—pushes, flexes—then snags hard enough that it makes a sharp *twang* when it’s yanked back.\n\nA new threat replaces it: a thin trickle of syrup begins to seep from the keyhole itself, dark and glossy, as if they’ve started feeding something through to dissolve or lubricate the jam. It threads down the door face toward the existing syrup line on the floor, thickening the hazard.\n\nKest’s voice tightens. “They’re changing tools.

He plants his boots wide on the gritty stone and leans in. “Got you.”\n\nHe glances around for anything solid. There’s no table—just storage racks bolted to the wall and the low service hatch at the passage end. He hooks his arm around the nearest rack upright and tries to wrench it free; it doesn’t budge. The bolts hold. “Nothing loose. Racks are fixed!”\n\nAt the chain, the clamped warden swallows and nods, eyes glassy with strain. He shifts one hand a hair, testing the edge of failure. “On your mark.”\n\nYou manage the wet cloth cleanly: you peel it off without dragging a syrup-string back toward the seam, drop it flat over the tacky matte paste, and grind dust into the remaining gloss with the chisel edge. The door-side syrup fan is now mostly dulled and gritty; there are no clean, continuous shiny “lanes” for flame to race along.\n\nMark answers with a hoarse, “Understood,” and crawls another half-body length away from the door, closer to the direction of the stairwell.\n\nThen the other side commits.\n\nKest’s head snaps up. “Run-up—NOW. One—two—three—”\n\nOn “three” the door takes a *full-body* impact: a deep, chest-rattling THUD that shudders through hinge and plank. Dust jumps off the racks. The hinge-plank flexes under your shoulders; the warden behind you grunts as the force tries to peel you both off the brace.\n\nThe chain goes taut with a metallic *twang*. The clamp-warden’s hands slip a fraction—just a fraction—before he bites down again, wrists shaking violently. “Still—holding!”\n\nA thin line of grit at the keyhole seam cracks and a fresh bead of syrup squeezes out faster than before, pushed by the shock. It runs into your dust dam and spreads, but it’s now coming *steadier*—not a single bead.\n\nKest, eyes wide, listens again. “They’re backing up for another. Heavier this time.”\n\nThreat: a second impact is imminent, and the last hit increased the ooze rate; if the door or chain gives, you’ll have a forced entry into a smoke-hazed, syrup-smeared threshold where a single spark could re-light everything.",

I’ll take the hit.”\n\nAt the clamp, you call the rotation. The chain-warden nods once, then peels his right hand off for a single breath. The chain shivers—audibly—and the clamp creaks, but his left hand holds. He shakes the right hand violently, fingers clawing open and shut once, then slams it back on. “Back.” His voice is thin with pain, but the clamp remains engaged; no slack is given.\n\nThe free warden goes for the racks. He jams fingers under a slat and yanks until his knuckles split; the wood groans but doesn’t come free—then, with a sharp crack, a thinner crosspiece snaps instead. He snatches the broken length and drops to wedge it under the hinge-plank as a chock. It bites awkwardly into the uneven stone, but it does add a stop. “Chock in!”\n\nYou scrape and heap fresh dust and grit into a thick ridge under the keyhole seam. The syrup that’s already oozing hits the ridge and spreads into it, turning the top layer into a sticky, gritty crust.\n\nThen Kest stiffens. “They’re not backing for a run-up.” He tilts his head, listening to the other side’s movements. “They’re *building*. Wood on wood. Something being set across—”\n\nA low, synchronized grunt comes through the door—several voices. The door shudders once, not from impact but from pressure testing.\n\nThreat: they’ve shifted to a braced ram or lever.

Your slate board rests on your thigh; you set a compass pin into mortar and drag chalk in a careful arc, counting the pull of the hex-line the way you learned to count footsteps in soot-sweet alleys. When the saints’ niches are quiet, you work faster. Tonight they aren’t. Stone mouths whisper in grit-soft syllables as you ink the curve with thorn-black.\n\nThe bell tolls again, and your chalk circle jerks a thumb’s breadth to the left—wrong. Your ward-sigil flares, then steadies, as if it had to catch its breath. In the lantern’s edge you see it: beneath the official lattice you were ordered to retrace, a **second grid** shows for a heartbeat, stitched in a precise hand you recognize from your apprenticeship—your own—then vanishes as the ward settles. Footsteps scrape above. A man in Crown leathers descends with the careful pace of someone who knows stairs can bite. His cloak is pinned with a thorn-brooch, but the pin is upside down—an old field sign for *unofficial orders*. He stops two steps above you, close enough that his gloved hand can reach your slate.\n\n“Cartographer Thistledown,” he says, voice low. “Senior Warden Brann wants your draft before dawn. No copies. No annotations. And—” His eyes flick to the saint niche beside you, where the statue’s lips are stained with candle soot. “—if you’ve heard the name **St. Vellum** tonight, you didn’t.”\n\nAnother toll rolls through the stone. Your compass needle swings toward the crypt door—toward a route your map says is sealed.\n\nThe man extends his hand for your slate while the hex-line keeps drifting under your knees.

Rain ticks through a cracked grating overhead, and each bell toll above makes the brick under your palm shiver. The air tastes of ash and sugared myrrh, and lanternlight turns warding nails into thin lines of gold.\n\nYou kneel on the third step from the bottom, where the Crown’s “safe route” marker should be. Your slate board rests on your thigh; you set a compass pin into mortar and drag chalk in a careful arc, counting the pull of the hex-line the way you learned to count footsteps in soot-sweet alleys. When the saints’ niches are quiet, you work faster. Tonight they aren’t. Stone mouths whisper in grit-soft syllables as you ink the curve with thorn-black.\n\nThe bell tolls again, and your chalk circle jerks a thumb’s breadth to the left—wrong. Your ward-sigil flares, then steadies, as if it had to catch its breath. In the lantern’s edge you see it: beneath the official lattice you were ordered to retrace, a **second grid** shows for a heartbeat, stitched in a precise hand you recognize from your apprenticeship—your own—then vanishes as the ward settles. Footsteps scrape above. A man in Crown leathers descends with the careful pace of someone who knows stairs can bite. His cloak is pinned with a thorn-brooch, but the pin is upside down—an old field sign for *unofficial orders*. He stops two steps above you, close enough that his gloved hand can reach your slate.\n\n“Cartographer Thistledown,” he says, voice low. “Senior Warden Brann wants your draft before dawn. No copies. No annotations. And—” His eyes flick to the saint niche beside you, where the statue’s lips are stained with candle soot. “—if you’ve heard the name **St. Vellum** tonight, you didn’t.”\n\nAnother toll rolls through the stone. Your compass needle swings toward the crypt door—toward a route your map says is sealed.\n\nThe man extends his hand for your slate while the hex-line keeps drifting under your knees. You have seconds to decide what you hand over, and what you follow."

His jaw tightens at the delay, but he doesn’t snatch; instead he shifts his stance to block the stairwell behind him, cutting off the view from above.\n\nYour palm closes around the compass pin. The needle doesn’t merely “strain”—it **tugs** hard enough that you feel it through the metal, dragging its point toward the sealed crypt door at the foot of the stairs. With the next bell toll, it snaps a few degrees farther, as if the door itself just moved closer.\n\nAt your question, the man answers too quickly, like he’s repeating a line he was given. “The lattice,” he says. Then, after a beat, quieter: “And the drift—only insofar as it makes the lattice look unreliable. Brann wants a clean map. The kind you can swear on in a hearing.”\n\nYour murmur to the saint niche earns you an immediate response—no gentle whisper, but a dry scrape like grit under teeth. The statue’s stone lips don’t move, yet the words come out from the niche-shadow beside its throat.\n\n“PLAINLY,” it rasps, and then, with a strange tenderness that doesn’t belong in stone: “THE SAFE ROUTE IS A LIE THEY PRACTICE.”\n\nThe escort flinches at the voice despite himself. His eyes flick to the niche, then back to you, and his hand goes to the short baton at his belt—not drawn, but ready. “Don’t,” he warns, as if you made the statue speak on purpose. “If it starts naming things, I’m obliged to report—”\n\nA soft click interrupts him: down at the crypt door, the iron seal ring shifts. Not opened—just **settling**, metal on metal, like something on the other side leaned its weight against it.\n\nThe threat is clear now: the drifting hex-lines are actively pulling toward that sealed door, and the seal is beginning to respond.\n\nThe escort extends his hand again, firmer. “Slate. Now. We leave this stairwell.”\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Vellumcrypt Passage\"],\"npcs_add\":[{\"name\":\"Crown Escort (unnamed)\",\"faction\":\"Crown of Thorns\",\"notes\":\"Assigned to retrieve Eirwen’s draft; wearing an upside-down thorn-brooch indicating unofficial orders.\"},{\"name\":\"St. Vellum (statue-saint)\",\"faction\":\"Cathedral of Moonbriar\",\"notes\":\"Whispers from a niche; reacts when addressed; claims the safe route is a practiced lie.\"}]}"

No pen. No starlight-ink hidden seam. You still manage a mark: a smear of chalk and grime, angled the way the compass yanked, but it’ll wash out with one rain-slick sleeve.\n\nAt the niche, St. Vellum answers in a single sentence, exactly as you asked—flat, unornamented, and ugly in its certainty:\n\n“THE DANGER IS THE MAP THAT MAKES THE DOOR OPEN.”\n\nThe escort’s head snaps toward the statue. “That’s enough.” He doesn’t draw his baton; instead he takes a small brass whistle from his collar and squeezes it once—silent to your ears, but the air in the stairwell tightens like a drawn thread.\n\nDown at the crypt door, the seal ring shifts again—this time not a settling click, but a slow, deliberate rotation, as if fingers on the far side are testing the shape of the lock through the metal. A thin line of pale dust sifts from the seam and falls in a steady sprinkle, making a faint crescent on the stone threshold.\n\nYou rise slowly. The escort nods once at your condition, but he doesn’t “lead” so much as herd: he steps up only two stairs, keeping his body between you and the upper landing while leaving your sightline to the ring open. His eyes never leave your hands now.\n\n“Third step,” he repeats, tight-lipped. “Fine. We back out. Quietly. If that ring turns a full quarter, we run.”\n\nThe silent-whistle thread you felt becomes visible in its effect: from somewhere above, bootsteps start down—fast, disciplined. Reinforcements, close.\n\nThe threat is immediate and specific: the seal ring is being worked from the inside, and Crown wardens are converging on this stairwell with your confiscated draft in the escort’s custody.  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}"

The escort watches you do it, then flicks his gaze to the mark you left. For the first time he looks genuinely uncertain—less about you, more about what he’s been told to contain.\n\n“Brann’s,” he answers softly. “Not Cathedral. Cathedral doesn’t come down like that.”\n\nBootsteps hit the upper landing: three, maybe four people, moving in practiced spacing. Lanternlight spills down the stairwell in a hard white fan. A voice follows—female, clipped, official.\n\n“Hold position. Hands visible. No one approaches the door.”\n\nTwo Crown wardens appear at the top of the stairs in thorn-leathers with ward-sashes. Behind them is a senior figure in a dark coat with a silver-thorn clasp. Her gaze goes straight past you to the crypt seal ring, as if she’s been listening to it for hours.\n\nAt your last line—*whose hand is holding the pen*—the escort’s mouth tightens. He doesn’t answer. He can’t, or won’t.\n\nThe seal ring below turns another fraction—enough that the old engraved prayer on it slides out of alignment. A faint sound comes through the seam now: not speech, not a growl—more like a slow inhale through teeth, patient and testing. The pale dust at the threshold lifts in a tiny spiral, as if drawn inward.\n\nThe senior warden raises her left hand. One of the wardens produces a coil of thorn-iron chain with chalk-sealed links.\n\n“We’re sealing the stair,” she says. “Cartographer Thistledown, you’re coming upstairs. Now.”\n\nThe immediate threat is clear: they’re about to chain the stairwell shut with you either above it—or trapped below with the door that’s waking."

The senior warden’s eyes flick down the stairwell to the crypt ring, then to the chain, doing the same arithmetic you are.\n\n“Hold,” she says, curt. The coil stops moving.\n\nYou reach her. Up close, she smells of camphor and wet iron. Her silver-thorn clasp bears a small notch pattern—rank marks you’ve seen on hearing-room wardens.\n\nYou keep your voice low; she answers at the same volume, without leaning in.\n\n“Warden-Seneschal Maudlin Kest,” she says. “Crown of Thorns. Authority: Civic Ward Integrity Act, subsection seven—emergency containment.”\n\nAt your question—written order or unofficial—her gaze goes to your escort’s upside-down thorn-brooch, then back to you. It’s a glance that lands like a verdict.\n\n“I’m acting on my own signature,” Kest says. “Brann’s name is a corridor people get lost in.”\n\nBehind her, one of the wardens takes a half-step to block the stairwell mouth, positioning to keep you from looking down. Kest doesn’t stop them—she just continues speaking.\n\n“You’re right about one thing,” she adds, quiet and sharp. “Some seals *help* a turning lock. So we won’t chain.”\n\nShe lifts two fingers. The junior warden swaps tools: instead of the thorn-iron chain, he produces a small clay puck stamped with a ward-sigil and presses it to the stone at the stairwell edge. It sticks with a wet *thunk*.\n\nA thin, translucent film—like cooled breath—begins to stretch across the stairwell opening behind you, forming a barrier that will block sound and sight *without* physically jarring the steps.\n\nDown below, the crypt ring turns again—slower now, as if feeling the new ward settle overhead—then pauses. The dust spiral at the threshold collapses and falls still.\n\nThreat, immediate and concrete: Kest is containing the stairwell in a way that cuts you off from observing the seal directly, and she has legal authority on her side; if you resist, you’ll be detained."

No prayers. No sudden turns.”\n\nHe gestures without looking away. Two Crown wardens step in close—one on each side—gloved hands settling on your shoulders with practiced firmness. Not rough, but immovable. Their thumbs find the seam where collarbone meets cloak, anchoring you as if you’re a cart they mean to keep from rolling.\n\nKest continues, “Your slate: I choose to read.”\n\nThe escort—still hooded—produces your slate from inside the cloak as if it had been there all along. He holds it flat in both hands, angled so you can see the surface but not touch it. A thin strip of pale material—Crown-issued correction vellum—peeks from his sleeve like a tongue.\n\nKest steps closer and begins reading aloud, line by line, voice steady.\n\nHe gets through your last clean measurements—then pauses on a segment where the chalk is smudged, as if a fingertip tested it. He looks up at you for the first time.\n\n“‘Second lattice under official grid… stitched in a hand I recognize…’” He stops before the name you would have written. The escort’s thumb shifts, just barely, as if ready to lay that correction strip down.\n\nThe wardens guide you forward to the edge. The film is now a visible skin across the stair-mouth: oil-sheen colors, trembling with each distant toll. Up close it doesn’t look like glass; it looks like a membrane that wants to breathe you.\n\nAs your boots reach the lip, the film dimples inward toward you—responding to your presence—then tightens, like it’s deciding whether to admit you or reflect you.\n\nYou have your sixty seconds. If you lean into the edge, you’ll be within a breath of the film; if you pull back, Kest’s reading continues and the escort’s correction strip is poised to touch your slate."

Each tick coincides with a distant bell-note—half a heartbeat after the sound arrives through stone. It isn’t dampening anything. It’s *listening*, then responding.\n\nA thin backflow ripples outward from the dimple—away from you, down the stair-mouth—like the film is pushing an answer into the ward-lines below.\n\nKest doesn’t finish your line.\n\nHe keeps his voice even, but he switches tracks mid-sentence as if the words have become officially unfit to exist in air. “—stitched in a hand you *claim* to recognize,” he reads, and the phrasing is wrong; you can hear the bureaucratic edge of it, the way an affidavit rewrites a witness.\n\nThe escort’s thumb moves.\n\nNot to place vellum—yet—but to *cover* the next word on the slate with the pad of his glove.

For an instant it tenses, drawing a pinprick of cold along your skin, as if testing for purchase.\n\nThen the left warden—breath still held in his chest now—brings his forearm up between you and the stair-mouth. The filament touches his sleeve instead. It clings.\n\nThe membrane dimples hard, as if satisfied, and the hair-thin line thickens to the width of twine. It begins to reel, pulling on the warden’s arm with a steady, patient force—not a jerk, but a *tow*. His shoulder yanks forward a fraction. Leather creaks.

Your palm buzzes as if you’ve pressed it to a plucked wire. The scarf fibers lift in tiny, frantic hairs. The line doesn’t care that it’s muffled; it cares that it’s *touched*. Where the cloth compresses it, the tether swells, thickening another fraction, and the pull resumes—steadier, more confident, as though now it has a better grip.\n\n“Brace!” you snap.\n\nBoth wardens obey.

The cloak’s hem flutters though there’s no wind. From the nails comes a low chorus, not words, but the sense of many small mouths humming in agreement.\n\nThe new threat is immediate and physical: the tether is now anchored and synchronized to the bell, actively hauling the left warden into the membrane, while the awakened ward-nails behind you are starting to resonate—if they fully “sing,” they’ll reinforce the boundary’s pull and make the landing itself unsafe to stand on."

You can move it now if you act.\n\nThen the stair-mouth answers: a wet, inward sigh from below, and a ripple runs through the mortar lines like something shifting its shoulders beneath the steps. The bells above thrum once—distant, but timed too neatly—and the crescent gouge you made frosts over with a lace of black grit.\n\nKest backs away from the wall fast, palm up in a warding gesture. “It’s *learning*, Thistledown. Whatever’s down there—it’s learning what you feed it.”\n\nFrom the crack, a whisper leaks—not words, a *direction*: the sensation of a corridor where no corridor should be, angled lover-shaped toward the underside. The crack widens a hair. Enough for a fingertip. Enough for a name to fit through if spoken."

The stone around the stair’s lip dimples inward, soft as wax for a blink, then returns to brick. Whatever’s below is testing weight.\n\nYou lean to the crack without breathing into it. The crack widens another hair, not from force, but from *permission*—as if it’s responding to the rules you set. The pull you asked for comes in a clean, physical way: dust on the step skates toward the crack in two distinct streams, then veers, refusing the iron crescent like it’s a cliff edge.\n\nThose dust-streams sketch a route for you—an angle down and left, under the cathedral’s crypt-stairs, toward the soot-sweet alleys.

He pinches a small stone from the grit at the threshold, rolls it in chalk until it’s pale, then slides it into the passage with two fingers—slow, deliberate, keeping his hand behind the crescent line.\n\nOutcome: the pebble skitters a foot, then settles. In the lantern’s low angle, it throws a faint reflected glow along the floor toward the far end.\n\nYou can see the service hatch more clearly now. It is shut—*but* the soot crust along its bottom rim isn’t intact. A thin line has been freshly disturbed, like something has been dragging a nail or fingertip back and forth in the grit.\n\nThen the hatch’s iron frame gives a tiny inward flex—barely a millimeter—followed by a second, more purposeful scrape from behind it.\n\nConsequence: the sound is quiet, but it’s answered immediately from outside your main door: a slow, satisfied **tap… tap** on the latch-side, as if the thing out there is keeping time with whatever is behind the hatch.\n\nThreat made plain: there is something behind the service hatch testing it from the inside, and something outside your door coordinating pressure and rhythm. If the hatch opens while the door is being timed, you could be caught between two points of entry—one behind your crescent and one in front of it.\n\nThe warden freezes on his knees, eyes wide, whispering without looking back: “It moved.”"

The hatch flexes upward… and stops dead against the strap. Leather creaks. The rack post gives a tiny, audible *tick* as it takes load. The hatch doesn’t lift, but the force redirects: the metal **grinds** sideways a fraction, trying to walk out from under the strap rather than up through it.\n\n“Strap’s holding,” Kest says, voice clipped.\n\nThe free warden drops to the pipe base and does exactly what you said: he packs paste over the shim/stone junction, building a blunt mound with no corners, then dusts it thick with chalk until it’s pale and matte. He redraws the moat wider at that point, making a fat chalked berm.\n\nThe syrup reacts like it’s offended.

He yanks two crate planks free, lays the longer one across the hatch so it spans from stone lip to stone lip, then shims both ends with the dry crib-wedges he’d been using under the pipe. He hammers the wedges down until the plank bows slightly and locks in compression against the masonry.\n\nThe hatch answers with a dull, constrained *thunk* as the bar takes load. The latch-side tool below immediately hits something it can’t “give” anymore—its *skritch* turns into a frustrated, higher scrape. The latch can’t rise without lifting the whole crossbar, and the crossbar is pinned by stone.\n\nConsequence: the pipe-cribbing is now partially cannibalized. The iron wall-pipe sags a hair and then settles—still supported, but less confidently. A thin thread of paste-syrup resumes from the cracked edge of the earlier seal and begins creeping toward the nearest wedge on the floor. Not fast, but it’s moving.\n\nYou start spoiling their timing at the hinge blister—pressing hard on the three-lift rhythm, easing during the pause.\n\nIt works for about two cycles. The pressure below “misses” once—one lift arrives into your hard press and goes nowhere, another arrives into your eased moment and gets only a shallow flex.\n\nThen whoever’s down there adapts. The rhythm changes: no longer three-and-pause. It becomes irregular—two quick, one long, then a half-beat stutter—trying to catch you off-pattern. The hinge-side blister gives a wet little *creep* under your palm: not a peel, but the paste is being slowly extruded sideways by repeated flexing.\n\nKest counts under his breath, close to your ear. “Two—two—long—” then, sharper, “Pause—now.” He’s right often enough to help, but the pattern keeps shifting.\n\nYou whisper to Mark beneath the hatch.\n\nA beat.\n\n**One scratch.**\n\nYes—he can reach the underside of the keyhole.\n\nImmediately after his scratch, you hear a faint, close sound from the key-gap area: Mark shifting position below, metal or bone brushing the underside of the hatch as he tries to get his hand or tool into place.\n\nAbove, the free warden glances at the creeping syrup line and says quietly, “Crossbar’s in. But I’ve robbed the pipe. If that paste reaches the wedges, it’ll start eating our feet out from under us.”\n\nThe immediate threats are now split and concrete:\n1) Below: coordinated pressure + a metal probe still worrying the key gap, now partially blocked by your crossbar but still attempting to clear it.\n2) Above: the paste-syrup has resumed creeping and is on course to undermine the remaining cribbing and wedges if it reaches them."

He deepens it with the edge of a plank until it’s a shallow gutter rather than a line. Then he drags a sacrificial plank to the far side of the moat and props it at a slight incline, making a new “easy path” that leads away from your cribbing.\n\nThe syrup reaches the moat, hesitates, then begins to creep along the chalk groove instead of straight forward—pulled by the fresh abrasion and the easier slope. It doesn’t stop, but it’s redirected; it starts sliding toward the sacrificial plank rather than your supports.\n\nConsequence: the chalk moat is buying time, not safety. The syrup is thin enough that it can eventually sheet across dust if it pools.\n\nYou keep your palm hard on the hinge blister.\n\nBelow, Mark moves. You hear a faint rasp right under the key gap—then a soft, gritty patter as he shakes dust or grit into place. The keyhole sound changes: the probe’s *skritch* becomes a duller *scrape*, like it’s pushing into packed grit instead of cutting paste cleanly.\n\nThen: *tink—tink—tink*—the probe tip testing, trying to find purchase.\n\nMark tries to smear the packed material upward. The underside contact becomes a slow *shhhk… shhhk…* as he presses and drags.\n\nFor a few seconds, the probe stalls.\n\nThen the attacker changes approach: a sharper, more forceful jab—*TINK*—followed by a short sawing motion. The grit plug holds, but you hear it being ground down. Mark’s breathing below the hatch gets louder for a moment, controlled but strained, as he keeps his fingers back.\n\nKest keeps counting, voice low but steady—until the hinge-side pressure does something new.\n\nInstead of lifting, it **rolls**—a levering twist along the hinge line. Under your palm the blister doesn’t just creep; it **shears** sideways a fraction with a wet, sticky *slip*. Not open, but a real loss of seal.\n\nKest barks, loud: “SLIP—HINGE!”\n\nAt the same time, a hairline gap opens at the hinge edge—thin as a needle—enough for cold air and a faint, sour-breath draft to kiss your wrist.

He’s got the second crossbar (a rough plank scavenged from the storage rack) held lengthwise, but he can’t bring it flush without crossing the syrup line.\n\n“I can seat it,” he says, breathless, “but I’ve got to reach over the slick.

It turns the edge into a gritty paste. On the other side, the slick probe (wire or something coated) slides in another fraction—then *catches*. You hear a faint, irritated tugging, and the probe withdraws with a dry, sandpapery scrape.\n\nThe wardens take your cue. The free one tears a strip off the dry linen cloth (already in the room) and wraps it around the end of the iron chisel like a crude swab.

The immediate effect is good: it stops the puddle from flowing and lowers the chance a fresh spark will skitter across it.\n\nConsequence: the cloth begins to *stick*. When you lift even slightly to reposition, strings of syrup cling and pull, trying to drag the wet cloth back toward the door-side fuel. It’s controllable, but it wants to bridge if you’re sloppy.\n\nMark stays back, coughing less now that the smoke has thinned. “I’ll—” cough, “—see if there’s a bucket. Or a chamber pot. Don’t move me.”\n\nThe chain-warden answers your question without looking up. “Two minutes. Maybe three.” His hands tremble visibly at the clamp. “After that my fingers go dead and the chain slips, and I’m not guessing which.”\n\nThen—faint but distinct—wood scrapes on wood from the far side of the door, like something long being dragged into position. Kest goes rigid. “They’re setting a brace. Or a ram.”\n\nThreat, clear: the other side is preparing a heavier forced entry. Your clamp-holder is on a short clock, and if the door takes a full hit while syrup continues to ooze at the seam, you risk both structural failure and renewed ignition."

If there’s a table, bench, anything solid, drag it in as a deadman brace against the door—*now*.”\n\nI rasp to the chain-warden, “On my mark you rotate hands—one at a time—don’t let the chain slack. We’ll trade you out if we can.”\n\nKeeping my shoulder planted, I peel the sticky wet cloth off the chisel carefully and drop it flat over the *matte paste* only—no dragging—then grind dust into the remaining gloss with the chisel edge. “No clean syrup lines. Nothing for flame to run.”\n\nThen, low to Mark: “Forget searching—stay put. If the door goes, you run for the stairwell and shout alarm.”"

He plants his boots wide on the gritty stone and leans in. “Got you.”\n\nHe glances around for anything solid. There’s no table—just storage racks bolted to the wall and the low service hatch at the passage end. He hooks his arm around the nearest rack upright and tries to wrench it free; it doesn’t budge. The bolts hold. “Nothing loose. Racks are fixed!”\n\nAt the chain, the clamped warden swallows and nods, eyes glassy with strain. He shifts one hand a hair, testing the edge of failure. “On your mark.”\n\nYou manage the wet cloth cleanly: you peel it off without dragging a syrup-string back toward the seam, drop it flat over the tacky matte paste, and grind dust into the remaining gloss with the chisel edge. The door-side syrup fan is now mostly dulled and gritty; there are no clean, continuous shiny “lanes” for flame to race along.\n\nMark answers with a hoarse, “Understood,” and crawls another half-body length away from the door, closer to the direction of the stairwell.\n\nThen the other side commits.\n\nKest’s head snaps up. “Run-up—NOW. One—two—three—”\n\nOn “three” the door takes a *full-body* impact: a deep, chest-rattling THUD that shudders through hinge and plank. Dust jumps off the racks. The hinge-plank flexes under your shoulders; the warden behind you grunts as the force tries to peel you both off the brace.\n\nThe chain goes taut with a metallic *twang*. The clamp-warden’s hands slip a fraction—just a fraction—before he bites down again, wrists shaking violently. “Still—holding!”\n\nA thin line of grit at the keyhole seam cracks and a fresh bead of syrup squeezes out faster than before, pushed by the shock. It runs into your dust dam and spreads, but it’s now coming *steadier*—not a single bead.\n\nKest, eyes wide, listens again. “They’re backing up for another. Heavier this time.”\n\nThreat: a second impact is imminent, and the last hit increased the ooze rate; if the door or chain gives, you’ll have a forced entry into a smoke-hazed, syrup-smeared threshold where a single spark could re-light everything."

Mark—NOW.” \n\nI jerk my chin at the bolted racks. “Free warden—rip a slat loose if you can; wedge it under the hinge-plank as a chock. If nothing breaks, shove your boot hard against the plank base and hold it like a stop.”\n\nI cough, then scrape a fresh load of dust and grit up into a thick ridge directly under the keyhole seam. “If the ooze surges on the next hit, we bury it—no clean trail, no flame path.”"

I’ll take the hit.”\n\nAt the clamp, you call the rotation. The chain-warden nods once, then peels his right hand off for a single breath. The chain shivers—audibly—and the clamp creaks, but his left hand holds. He shakes the right hand violently, fingers clawing open and shut once, then slams it back on. “Back.” His voice is thin with pain, but the clamp remains engaged; no slack is given.\n\nThe free warden goes for the racks. He jams fingers under a slat and yanks until his knuckles split; the wood groans but doesn’t come free—then, with a sharp crack, a thinner crosspiece snaps instead. He snatches the broken length and drops to wedge it under the hinge-plank as a chock. It bites awkwardly into the uneven stone, but it does add a stop. “Chock in!”\n\nYou scrape and heap fresh dust and grit into a thick ridge under the keyhole seam. The syrup that’s already oozing hits the ridge and spreads into it, turning the top layer into a sticky, gritty crust.\n\nThen Kest stiffens. “They’re not backing for a run-up.” He tilts his head, listening to the other side’s movements. “They’re *building*. Wood on wood. Something being set across—”\n\nA low, synchronized grunt comes through the door—several voices. The door shudders once, not from impact but from pressure testing.\n\nThreat: they’ve shifted to a braced ram or lever. Instead of one big hit, you’re about to face sustained, coordinated force that will steadily defeat the hinge-plank and the clamp unless relieved—while the keyhole seam continues to ooze faster with every vibration."
