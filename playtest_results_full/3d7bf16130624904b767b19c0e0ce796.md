### Turn 4 [PLAYER]

Elowen “Wren” Ashford grew up above her family’s crumbling seaside funeral home, where lullabies mingled with the hush of the dead. Now a restoration artist for a quirky historic cemetery, she coaxes mossy angels and stained stone back to life with patient, reverent hands. Soft-spoken yet stubbornly curious, she hides a wry, whimsical humor behind careful politeness and a heart that feels too much. Wren’s private goal is to uncover the truth behind her mother’s long-ago disappearance—without letting herself fall for the brooding newcomer whose presence makes the graveyard feel strangely, tenderly alive.

### Turn 5 [GAME]

Here's your character:

**Elowen "Wren" Ashford**
*Restoration artist and conservation specialist for a quirky historic cemetery*

Wren was raised above Ashford & Daughters Funeral Home on a salt-stung coast, learning early to treat grief with gentleness and to listen to what people won’t say out loud. Her mother vanished when Wren was a teen, leaving behind a few unsettling clues and a family that learned to survive on quiet routines. She now lives in a small apartment near the cemetery she tends, collecting sea-glass charms and keeping her questions carefully folded behind impeccable manners.

**Traits:** soft-spoken, stubbornly curious, wryly whimsical, tender-hearted, patient and meticulous
**Goal:** Uncover the truth behind her mother’s long-ago disappearance by following the scattered hints hidden in old funeral home records and cemetery plots—while resisting (or surviving) her growing attachment to the brooding newcomer who makes the graveyard feel unexpectedly alive.

### Turn 9 [GAME]

Morning, Saltmarrow Cemetery’s upper tier—Lantern Row—where the path narrows between leaning slate and a low iron fence furred with salt. Sea-mist beads on carved names until they look freshly inked. The lanterns are still lit from last night, and each flame sputters an unhealthy blue that makes the gravel look cold.

You kneel beside the Harrowell marker, apron tied, hair pinned back the way you learned above Ashford & Daughters. A soft brush clears lichen from a serifed “E,” and your small tools click in your pocket when you shift your weight. You test the stone with a fingertip, careful as if it were skin, then set a stencil to match the original cut. Patience is part of the job; so is noticing what other people hope you won’t.

The date is wrong.

Yesterday the stone read *1889*. Today it reads *1883*, the new “3” cut too clean to be weather. At the base, fresh grit still sits in the chisel line. You lean closer and find a second problem: the border stones around the Harrowell plot have been nudged inward, just enough that the corner now bites into the neighboring family’s ground. That kind of shift takes time, leverage, and permission—unless someone is doing it before dawn.

Footsteps crunch behind you. When you turn, a man stands just inside the gate, coat damp at the shoulders, dark hair still threaded with mist. He doesn’t carry a tour pamphlet or a wreath. He holds a folded sheet of vellum in one hand and keeps the other near his pocket like he’s used to trouble. “Elowen Ashford,” he says, not asking. He opens the vellum just enough for you to see a maintenance overlay of the cemetery—ghost paths, sealed sections—and three plot coordinates inked in your mother’s looping shorthand.

“I bought this from someone who shouldn’t have it,” he says. “Your name was the only instruction.”

The blue lantern above you gutters hard, as if reacting.

You have a freshly altered grave at your knees, an impossible map in a stranger’s hand, and a town heading toward the Brine-Choir’s vigil tonight. He waits for an answer, and the cemetery stays very still.

### Turn 10 [PLAYER]

I rise slowly, wiping my fingers on my apron, and step just close enough to see the ink clearly. “That *is* my mother’s hand,” I say, voice careful. “Who sold it to you—and why were they carrying cemetery overlays in the first place?”

*Agent reasoning: This is my mother’s handwriting—panic and hope in equal measure—so I need to see the vellum up close, but I don’t trust him yet; I’ll keep things polite and controlled while clocking the altered headstone as another immediate threat.*

### Turn 11 [GAME]

You step in, close enough that the vellum’s surface catches the lanternlight. The ink is old-black, not the newer soot-brown the Society uses—your mother’s habit of tightening the downstrokes is there, unmistakable. The stranger doesn’t pull it away, but his grip firms at the corners.

He answers your questions in the wrong order.

“Because the cemetery is being run like a ledger,” he says, low. “And ledgers have overlays.”

Then: “A lantern-lighter sold it to me. Not one of the public-facing guides—one of the ones who carries keys.” His eyes flick past your shoulder, toward the path behind you, as if expecting someone to be listening. “He didn’t give a name. He had a thumb missing to the first knuckle and smelled like lamp-oil and brine. He said the map was ‘hot’ and that if I wanted the rest of it, I should find you before the Choir started singing tonight.”

As he speaks, a faint click comes from the iron fence to your left—metal on metal, like a latch being tested. You look: nothing obvious moves, but the chain on the side gate is hanging differently than you remember, the padlock turned outward instead of inward.

The blue lantern above you sputters again. In that brief stutter, you catch it: a second set of footprints in the damp gravel off the main path—too narrow for the caretaker’s boots you know, toes pointed toward you and the stranger, then scuffed as if someone backed away into the grass.

The man folds the vellum once, not hiding it fully but making it easier to snatch. “If you want to ask me what I’m doing in Saltmarrow,” he adds, “do it somewhere that isn’t lit like a signal.”

Another sound—soft, deliberate—comes from the row of headstones behind the Harrowell plot: the scrape of grit under a shoe sole. Whoever it is, they’re close enough now that they’re choosing to be heard.

### Turn 12 [PLAYER]

I catch his sleeve and tug him toward the Harrowell mausoleum’s shadow, keeping my voice even. “Fold it—now. And stay close.” Then, louder, I call into the stones behind us: “Cemetery’s closed. If you’ve got business, say it plainly—before I start shouting for the caretaker.”

*Agent reasoning: Someone’s shadowing us, and I won’t let a stranger—or my mother’s map—get snatched. I need to move us out of the lanternlight and force the watcher to show themselves.*

### Turn 13 [GAME]

Your fingers close on his sleeve—wool damp and cold—and you pull him into the Harrowell mausoleum’s lee. The stone there holds the night’s chill; the blue lanternlight doesn’t reach cleanly, and the mist seems to hesitate at the carved angels over the door.

He obeys immediately. The vellum folds in practiced, quick creases and disappears into the inner pocket of his coat. He shifts so his body blocks the mausoleum door seam, eyes fixed on the row of headstones you called out to.

Your voice carries. “Cemetery’s closed…”

For a beat, nothing answers—only the buoy-bell’s distant moan and the lantern’s wet sputter.

Then someone steps into view between two slates: a Lanternward man in a dark oilskin, lantern-hook belt at his waist. His left hand is wrapped in stained cloth, thumb stump blunt beneath it. He holds a long-handled lantern snuffer like a walking stick, and his face is drawn tight with sleeplessness.

He stops where the path widens, keeping a respectful distance that still feels like a boundary. “No need to shout, Miss Ashford,” he says, voice mild and rehearsed. “Caretaker sent me to check the blue lamps. Folks have been… fretting.”

Behind him, a second figure doesn’t step out—only a suggestion of movement in the grass line to his right, where the mist thickens. You hear a quiet exhale and the faint clink of something metal being adjusted, like a buckle or a keyring.

The Lanternward man’s gaze flicks to the Harrowell stone at your knees—wrong date, nudged borders—and then to the stranger’s coat pocket, too quickly to be accidental. “You’ve got company,” he notes, as if it’s casual. “Not a tour day.”

The stranger beside you goes still. His hand stays visible, empty, but his posture changes—ready.

The Lanternward man lifts his snuffer a few inches, not threatening exactly, but making it clear he can close lanterns—make dark—fast. “If you’ve found something you shouldn’t,” he says, softer now, “best you hand it over. The Society doesn’t like… misunderstandings. Especially before a vigil.”

He doesn’t advance. He waits, and the hidden presence in the grass waits with him.

### Turn 14 [PLAYER]

I let my shoulders soften into a tired little sigh, like he’s interrupted nothing more dangerous than moss removal. “The caretaker didn’t mention you—what’s your name?” I ask, then take a small step sideways so my back is to the mausoleum and my eyes can keep the grass line in view. “And if the Society wants something from me, they can ask me in daylight, in the office, with proper records—so unless you’re here to explain why the Harrowell date changed overnight, you can put that snuffer down.”

*Agent reasoning: Lanternward with keys means he’s the seller—and he’s not alone. I’m not giving up my mother’s map, but I can buy time by playing polite and harmless while edging us toward a safer, more public path.*

### Turn 15 [GAME]

Your tired sigh lands the way you intend: ordinary, put-upon. You shift sideways until your shoulder touches the mausoleum’s cold stone, giving you a clean angle on the grass line.

The Lanternward man’s expression tightens at the question. For a moment he looks like he might ignore it—then he answers, as if forced by habit into politeness.

“Pell,” he says. “Jory Pell.”

He does not lower the snuffer. Instead, he plants its ferrule on the gravel and leans on it, casual as a cane. “Daylight, office, proper records,” he repeats, tasting the words. “That’s the trouble with you Ashfords. You think paper keeps you safe.”

At the mention of the Harrowell date, his eyes cut to the stone again. He doesn’t deny it changed. That silence is its own admission.

From the grass line to Pell’s right, the hidden figure finally commits: a woman steps half out of the mist, not Lanternward-uniformed—plain dark dress, hair pinned tight, a ring of keys on a chain at her waist. She doesn’t look at you first; she looks at the stranger, then at Pell, and gives the smallest nod, like confirming a description.

Pell speaks again, voice still mild, but the edges are sharper. “You can keep your voice down and we can all walk away tidy. Or you can shout for a caretaker who isn’t on this tier, and my friend here—Mara—will make sure your shouting doesn’t carry.”

Mara’s hand comes up. Not a weapon—an oiled cloth and a small glass bottle. The smell hits even from a few paces: sharp, sweet, medicinal. Ether or something like it.

The threat is clear now: they’re not here to argue policy. They’re here to take the map and, if necessary, quiet you.

Pell shifts his weight forward one step, closing distance. “Last chance,” he says, eyes on the stranger’s coat pocket. “Hand it over.”

The blue lantern above you gutters hard, and for a second the path is darker—enough for Mara to angle her body as if preparing to rush from the grass.

### Turn 16 [PLAYER]

I lift my hands slowly, palms out. “All right—easy,” I say, then glance up at the sputtering blue lantern. “If you’re Lanternward, prove it: snuff that one. It’s spooking the whole tier.”  
As Pell’s attention flicks upward, I hook my foot behind the Harrowell border stone and kick gravel hard into the path between us, then grab the stranger’s sleeve again and hiss, “Run—down Lantern Row, don’t look back,” and I shout at the top of my lungs, “CARETAKER—UPPER TIER! HELP!”

*Agent reasoning: They’re here to drug me and take the vellum; I need distance, noise, and to keep the map out of their hands. I’ll create a distraction with the lantern/snuffer and use my voice to draw attention while we move.*

### Turn 17 [GAME]

Pell’s eyes do flick up at the blue lantern—just a reflex, the way anyone who lives by flame can’t help but check a gutter.

He does not snuff it.

But that half-beat is enough.

Your foot hooks the Harrowell border stone and you kick. Gravel sprays across the path in a harsh hiss, pelting Pell’s oilskin and skittering under his boots. His next step slips; he catches himself with the snuffer’s ferrule, metal scraping stone.

You seize the stranger’s sleeve and shove him into motion. He doesn’t argue—he bolts, coat tails snapping, heading down Lantern Row exactly as you ordered.

Mara moves immediately. She lunges after him, keys clinking, bottle and cloth up like she’s done this before. Pell barks, “Not the girl—get the map!” and surges forward toward you instead, trying to cut you off from following.

You shout—full-throated, tearing sound that bounces off slate and marble: “CARETAKER—UPPER TIER! HELP!”

The tier answers with movement, not a voice. From farther downslope, a lantern flares brighter—someone has heard, or at least seen the commotion. But it’s not close.

Pell closes the distance fast. He swings the snuffer not at your head, but low, aiming to hook your ankle or knock your legs out from under you. You jerk back against the mausoleum stone; the snuffer’s rim clips your shin with a hard, numbing smack.

Pain blossoms hot and immediate. Your leg holds, but it stings and your balance wobbles.

Mara is already several strides after the stranger—then she hesitates as your shout carries. She glances back once, calculating, and hisses something to Pell you don’t catch.

Pell’s face changes—less polite, more urgent. “You’ve made it messy,” he snaps, and reaches with his free hand for your wrist, trying to pin you to the mausoleum wall and keep you from giving chase or screaming again.

Down Lantern Row, the stranger is a dark shape running through blue-guttering pools of light—Mara gaining on him in the mist, cloth raised.

**Threat, clear:** Pell is trying to restrain you physically; Mara is attempting to catch the stranger and use the drugged cloth on him to take the map.

### Turn 18 [PLAYER]

I drive my elbow back into Pell’s ribs and twist my wrist hard, then snatch the stiff edge of my apron up over my nose and mouth as I scream again, “HELP—LANTERN ROW!”  
Stumbling on my sore shin, I grab my water tin and fling it down the path toward Mara, shouting, “HEY—MARA! PUT IT DOWN!”

*Agent reasoning: Wren won’t let herself be dragged off quietly—she’ll fight dirty with whatever’s at hand and keep drawing attention, while trying to stop Mara from catching the stranger.*

### Turn 19 [GAME]

Your elbow drives back into Pell’s ribs with a dull, satisfying thud. He grunts—air knocked out—and his grip loosens just enough for you to wrench your wrist free. You twist hard; his fingers scrape your skin and then slip off.

You yank your apron up over your nose and mouth and scream again, louder, ragged with pain in your shin: “HELP—LANTERN ROW!”

This time you get an answer: a man’s voice, distant but real, calling, “Oi! Up there!” Footsteps start pounding uphill, still far—at least half a tier down.

Pell recovers fast. His face goes mean with embarrassment. “Shut—up,” he spits, and swings the snuffer again, higher now, aiming to clip your shoulder and drive you back into the mausoleum’s shadow. The rim catches your upper arm—hard enough to make your fingers go numb for a second, not enough to drop you.

You fumble for your water tin—small, dented, half-full—and fling it down the path toward Mara.

It sails low and fast, then bounces off a headstone base with a loud *clang* and skitters into the gravel, spraying water in a brief arc. The noise makes Mara flinch and glance back.

Your shout—“HEY—MARA! PUT IT DOWN!”—lands. Mara’s jaw tightens; she doesn’t put anything down. She changes tactics.

She stops chasing straight at the stranger and instead cuts across the grass to intercept him where Lantern Row narrows between two leaning stones. Keys flash at her waist as she moves. The cloth stays raised, bottle in her other hand.

The stranger is still running, but he’s about to hit that pinch-point in the path—Mara is positioning to step into him from the side and clamp the cloth over his face.

Behind you, Pell steps in again, closer than before. He reaches not for your wrist this time, but for the apron at your face—trying to yank it down and force you to breathe whatever Mara has. His breath smells of lamp-oil and salt.

**Immediate threats:**
- Pell is within arm’s reach and trying to control your breathing/face covering.
- Mara is about to intercept the stranger at a narrow section of Lantern Row and use the drugged cloth.

### Turn 20 [PLAYER]

I clamp the apron tight with one hand and bite Pell’s reaching fingers as hard as I can, then knee him—clumsy but vicious—right where it’ll count. “DON’T TOUCH ME,” I snarl through the cloth, and I scream again, “LANTERN ROW—SHE’S GOT ETHER!”  
Then I lunge toward the path and shout after the stranger, “LEFT—OFF THE ROW, THROUGH THE YEW BREAK!”

*Agent reasoning: Pell going for my face is a line I can’t let him cross; I need to keep the apron up and make noise while buying the stranger seconds to avoid Mara’s intercept.*

### Turn 21 [GAME]

You clamp the apron to your face and when Pell’s hand claws for it, you catch two of his fingers between your teeth. You bite down hard.

He yelps—high and involuntary—and jerks back, shaking his hand as blood beads along the knuckles. Before he can reset, your knee comes up.

It’s not graceful, but it lands. Pell folds with a choked noise, the snuffer clattering against the mausoleum stone. He staggers sideways, one hand cupped between his legs, the other held up and bleeding, eyes watering with rage.

“DON’T TOUCH ME,” you snarl through the cloth.

You scream again, voice tearing: “LANTERN ROW—SHE’S GOT ETHER!”

That word changes the air. Down the slope, the running footsteps you heard speed up—two sets now—and someone shouts back, “ETHER? WHO—?”

Mara hears it too. She’s at the pinch-point just as the stranger reaches it. She darts in from the side, cloth snapping up toward his face.

But your shout and your next call hit in the same instant: “LEFT—OFF THE ROW, THROUGH THE YEW BREAK!”

The stranger commits on instinct. He veers left, shoulder-checking into the yew’s dark gap instead of pushing through the narrow stones. Mara’s cloth brushes his cheek—not a full seal—and he stumbles into the branches, coughing, but he’s still moving.

Mara swears, sharp and low, and plunges after him. The yew boughs whip and scrape; her keys jangle wildly, giving away her line.

Behind you, Pell isn’t finished. He straightens with a hiss, face blotched with pain and humiliation. He snatches up the snuffer again and—rather than swing—he lunges to tackle, trying to drive you to the ground and stop you from shouting any more.

You have a heartbeat of warning: his boots scrape on gravel, shoulders dropping as he comes in.

Down Lantern Row, lanternlight flares—two figures cresting the rise, still a short run away. They’re close enough now that Pell glances toward them, calculating whether to finish this fast or flee.

**Threats now:** Pell is mid-lunge to take you down; Mara is in pursuit through the yew break, and the stranger is not yet safe—he’s being chased in close quarters where a cloth can be clamped over his face.

### Turn 22 [PLAYER]

I sidestep at the last second and grab for Pell’s coat collar and snuffer arm, trying to use his momentum to sling him into the mausoleum wall, then I shout at the approaching lanterns, “JORY PELL—LANTERNWARD—HE’S GOT A SNUFFER AND SHE’S GOT ETHER!”

*Agent reasoning: Pell’s trying to take me down right as help is almost here; if I can spoil his tackle and make noise, he’ll either flee or get caught. The stranger’s in the yew with Mara—too far for me to reach safely, but I can at least keep Mara from doubling back by drawing attention and keeping Pell pinned in place.*

### Turn 23 [GAME]

You sidestep as Pell lunges. Your hand snags his coat collar; your other clamps his snuffer arm at the elbow. For a moment you have him—his momentum rolling past you—and you wrench, trying to sling him into the mausoleum wall.

It half-works.

Pell’s shoulder smashes into the stone with a meaty *thunk*, and his snuffer arm bangs hard enough that the metal rings. But he’s heavier than you and already braced for a struggle; instead of being thrown cleanly, he twists with the impact, rips his collar partly free, and drags you with him. Your sore shin skates on loose gravel; pain spikes and you nearly go down.

Pell uses the tangle to his advantage—he shoves his forearm across your upper chest and tries to pin you against the mausoleum, snuffer still in his fist, held awkwardly between you. Close enough that you can smell his lamp-oil breath again.

You shout over him, voice raw: “JORY PELL—LANTERNWARD—HE’S GOT A SNUFFER AND SHE’S GOT ETHER!”

The two figures crest the rise fully into view—Lanternward, by their coats and the hooked lantern poles. One is broad-shouldered with a lantern pole in both hands; the other carries a hand-lantern and a ring of keys that clinks as he runs.

“Pell?!” the broad one barks, skidding to a stop and raising the pole like a staff. The key-bearer’s lantern swings, throwing blue light over Pell’s bloody knuckles and your apron over your face.

Pell’s eyes flick to them—panic, then a hard decision. He snaps, “She’s lying—she’s—” and tries to wrench the snuffer up between you, as if to threaten you into silence.

The broad Lanternward steps in fast and drives the lantern pole across Pell’s forearms, pinning the snuffer arm down with a sharp crack of wood on bone. Pell swears and recoils, grip faltering.

“Drop it,” the broad one orders, voice suddenly official. The key-bearer moves to your side, reaching for your shoulder—not to grab, but to pull you back from Pell and put himself between you.

Down the yew break, you hear branches thrash and Mara’s keys jangling—she’s still chasing the stranger, and now she knows help has arrived.

**Immediate threat:** Mara is still loose with ether in the yews; Pell is being restrained but not yet disarmed, and the Lanternward are about to decide who they believe.

### Turn 24 [PLAYER]

I stumble back a step from Pell, keeping my apron over my nose and mouth, and point hard toward the yew break. “He’s not alone—Mara went that way with ether after a stranger. One of you, NOW—cut her off before she gets him.”  
Then I look the broad-shouldered Lanternward dead in the face. “Search Pell. Check his pockets and hands—he tried to restrain me. I’m Wren Ashford, cemetery conservation—ask your caretaker if you need a name.”

*Agent reasoning: Pell’s the immediate danger, but Mara with ether is the real ticking clock; I need the Lanternward to act fast and believe me, and I want distance so I can breathe and think.*

### Turn 26 [PLAYER]

I stagger back a step, apron still clamped over my nose and mouth, and jab my finger toward the yew break. “He’s not alone—Mara went that way with ether after a stranger. One of you, now—cut her off before she gets him.”  
Then I fix the broad Lanternward with a steady look. “Search Pell. Check his pockets and his hands—he tried to restrain me. I’m Wren Ashford, cemetery conservation. Ask the caretaker if you need a name.”

*Agent reasoning: Mara’s still out there with ether and the stranger’s about to be caught; the Lanternward need clear, immediate directions, and I need to anchor my credibility fast with my name and the caretaker.*

### Turn 27 [GAME]

The key-bearer Lanternward catches your elbow and pulls you two steps back from Pell, putting his own body between you and the snuffer. He keeps his lantern low; the flame inside it still sputters an unhealthy blue.

The broad-shouldered Lanternward doesn’t take his eyes off Pell. “Mara?” he repeats, like the name tastes wrong. Then, without looking away, he snaps at his partner: “Tolan—go. Cut the yew break. Don’t breathe deep if she’s got ether.”

Tolan hesitates—eyes flicking from you to Pell to the dark gap in the yews—then he breaks into a run, lantern bobbing, boots crunching hard as he angles left toward the thicket.

Pell, half-pinned by the lantern pole, tries to straighten and put on indignation. “This is—this is Ashford trouble—she’s—”

“Hands,” the broad one orders.

He shifts the lantern pole to keep Pell’s snuffer arm trapped against the mausoleum stone, then uses his free hand to wrench Pell’s other wrist up and slap it flat to the wall. Pell hisses in pain. The broad Lanternward pats Pell down briskly—coat pockets, waist, inner breast.

His fingers find something. He pulls out a small glass vial wrapped in oiled cloth. When he uncorks it a hair, a sharp, sweet-chemical smell cuts even through your apron.

Pell’s face goes tight. “That’s not—”

The broad Lanternward corks it immediately and stares at Pell like a door has closed. “Ether,” he says, flat. Then, to you, without softening: “Wren Ashford. I know the name. Don’t move from here.”

He yanks Pell’s snuffer hand open. The snuffer drops; the broad Lanternward kicks it away across the gravel where it rings against a headstone base.

From the yew break comes a sudden muffled cough—male, rough—followed by Mara’s voice, breathless and furious: “Stop—STOP—”

Tolan’s lanternlight flashes through the branches as he arrives, and you hear him shout, “Lanternward! Mara, stand down!”

The threat is still active in the yews: Mara is close enough to be heard, ether is confirmed, and the stranger is coughing—possibly exposed.

### Turn 28 [PLAYER]

I keep my apron tight over my nose and mouth and call toward the yews, “Tolan—keep upwind and don’t let her get the cloth on his face!” Then I glance at the broad Lanternward, voice rough. “Let me go with you—I know the breaks in that yew line. If he’s breathing ether, get him into open air—now.”

*Agent reasoning: Mara’s still loose and someone’s coughing in the yews—if ether’s on that cloth, seconds matter. I’m shaken but I can’t stand still; I’ll keep my face covered, warn them, and try to help the stranger without charging in blindly.*

### Turn 29 [GAME]

Your voice carries into the yews. Tolan’s answer comes back sharp, already moving: “Upwind—got it!”

The broad-shouldered Lanternward—close enough now that you can see the salt-whitened seams on his gloves—doesn’t immediately agree. He hooks two fingers in the front of your apron and tugs it down just enough to see your mouth and nose are covered properly, then releases it.

“You go in there and you go down,” he says, curt. “And then I’ve got two problems.”

Another cough hacks through the yew break—wet and panicked—followed by a scuffle of shoes on roots. Mara’s voice snaps, nearer than before: “Hold still—just—hold still!”

Tolan’s lantern flares in the branches as he forces his way deeper. You hear a brief, ugly struggle—fabric tearing, someone’s elbow striking wood—then Tolan yells, “Cloth! She’s got a cloth—”

The broad Lanternward makes a decision. He shoves Pell harder into the mausoleum and plants his lantern pole across Pell’s chest like a bar.

“Don’t move,” he tells Pell, low. Then, to you: “You stay where I can see you. If you know the breaks, point. Loud.”

He breaks into a run toward the yew line, lantern in hand, boots slipping once on gravel before catching. As he goes, he calls, “Tolan—drag him out! Don’t wrestle in the thicket!”

From where you stand, you can see just enough: Tolan’s lanternlight jerks, then steadies as he backs out of the yews—hauling a man by the collar and under one arm. The stranger’s knees drag; his head lolls; he’s coughing but fading between coughs, eyes half-shut. Mara is right behind them, hair loose, one hand clutching a rag-dark cloth, the other reaching for the stranger’s shoulder like she can still reclaim him.

The broad Lanternward meets them at the edge and barks, “Mara—hands up. Now.”

Mara freezes for a heartbeat—then her eyes flick past him, toward you, and her fingers tighten on the cloth.

**Threat, clear and present:** Mara still has ether on a cloth and is close enough to press it to the stranger again; the stranger is partially exposed and unsteady, and the Lanternward are split between restraining Mara and keeping Pell pinned behind you.

I keep my apron tight and step sideways to keep Pell in my peripheral, then shout, “Mara—don’t you dare! That’s enough, you’ll kill him!”  
To the broad Lanternward I call, “She’s still got the rag—take her wrist, not the cloth, and get him into open air—face turned away, upwind!”

*Agent reasoning: Mara’s about to use the cloth again; I can’t fight her, but I can distract and warn the Lanternward while keeping my airway covered.*

### Turn 31 [GAME]

Your sideways step keeps Pell in the edge of your vision—his shoulders tense under the lantern pole, jaw working like he’s chewing through a lie.

Your shout hits Mara like a thrown stone. For an instant she falters, eyes widening, and the cloth droops an inch.

Then the broad Lanternward takes your instruction exactly the way you meant it: he doesn’t grab for the rag. He lunges for *her wrist*.

Mara twists, fast—trained fast—and the ether-cloth flicks toward his face like a slap. He turns his head away at the last second, but the edge of the rag brushes his cheekbone. He grunts, eyes watering, and still clamps down on her wrist hard enough that you hear the small, sick click of bone shifting.

Mara gasps—half pain, half fury—and tries to switch the cloth to her other hand.

“Tolan—OPEN AIR!” the broad Lanternward barks, voice thickening as he forces breath through his mouth.

Tolan obeys. He drags the stranger two more body-lengths out onto the open gravel, then drops to a knee behind him and hauls him upright, keeping the man’s face turned away from Mara and the yews. The stranger coughs again—stronger, but ragged—spit darkening his lip. His eyes crack open, unfocused.

Mara jerks against the hold. “You don’t understand—he *can’t*—”

“Enough,” the broad Lanternward snarls. He wrenches her arm behind her back and forces her down to her knees at the yew’s edge. The ether-cloth slips from her fingers and falls onto the damp grass.

But the danger doesn’t vanish—it *moves*.

Behind you, Pell suddenly bucks his weight sideways, trying to slide out from under the lantern pole while the broad Lanternward is occupied. The pole scrapes stone with a shriek. Pell’s free hand snakes toward his coat hem—toward somewhere he didn’t have time to be searched.

**Immediate threat:** Pell is trying to get free and reach for something concealed on his person, while the broad Lanternward is restraining Mara and Tolan is occupied keeping the stranger breathing in open air.

### Turn 32 [PLAYER]

I lurch back to the mausoleum and stomp hard on Pell’s reaching hand/coat hem, pinning it to the stone as best I can, and shout, “He’s going for something—Pell’s armed, search him again!”

*Agent reasoning: Pell moving now means he’s about to pull something worse; I’m not strong enough to fight him cleanly, but I can stop his hand and call for help while keeping my face covered.*

### Turn 33 [GAME]

You slam back against the mausoleum stones and bring your heel down where Pell’s hand disappears under his coat hem.

Your boot pins cloth and knuckles to cold marble. Pell lets out a sharp, ugly yell and his fingers spasm—something hard clinks once against stone beneath your sole, trapped.

He tries to wrench free, but you’ve got his hand caught at a bad angle. He bucks his shoulder, face twisting toward you. “You—little—” His other arm is still pinned awkwardly by the lantern pole across his chest; he can’t get leverage without scraping himself raw against it.

When you shout, the broad Lanternward’s head snaps toward you—eyes red-rimmed from the ether brush. He doesn’t release Mara, but he shifts his weight and bellows, “Tolan! On Pell—NOW!”

Tolan hesitates only long enough to make sure the stranger won’t topple: he shoves the half-conscious man into a seated slump against a low headstone base, then sprints back across the gravel.

Mara, on her knees, takes advantage of the split second. Her free hand snakes toward the dropped ether-cloth in the grass.

The broad Lanternward sees it and drives his knee into her upper back, forcing her chest-down. “Don’t,” he growls, and yanks her wrists together behind her.

Tolan hits the mausoleum hard. He drops to one knee beside you and Pell and grabs Pell’s coat hem where your boot pins it. “Hold—hold!” he snaps, then pries the fabric up with two fingers and reaches in.

His hand comes out with a compact folding knife—dark handle, salt-stained pivot—half-open from Pell’s fumbling. Tolan flings it away across the gravel; it skitters and disappears under a border of rosemary offerings.

Pell goes pale with rage, then—quick as a reflex—spits, a wet gob that lands near your boot. “Ashford,” he hisses, like it’s a curse. “You don’t know who you’re helping.”

**Current threats, clearly:** Pell is restrained but still dangerous if he wriggles free; Mara is pinned but still conscious and fighting; the stranger is sitting unattended a few paces away, breathing hard and possibly drugged, with no one watching him closely for another attempt.

### Turn 34 [PLAYER]

I keep my boot planted on Pell’s hand and lean down just enough to hiss, “Spit again and I’ll grind your knuckles to bone.” Then I call to Tolan, “Stay on his wrists—tight—he’s still reaching.”  
I flick my eyes to the broad Lanternward. “That man by the headstone—check his breathing. Sit him up, open air, and keep Mara away from that cloth.”

*Agent reasoning: Pell’s knife was the immediate danger; now the stranger might slip away or crash, and Mara could still get to the ether. I want to keep Pell pinned but make sure the stranger doesn’t die on a headstone while everyone’s distracted.*

### Turn 35 [GAME]

Pell freezes under your heel, breath coming in short, furious pulls. His eyes track your face, then flick to the yews as if measuring distance. He doesn’t spit again—his lips press into a thin, resentful line.

Tolan takes your cue and commits. He hooks Pell’s near wrist, then the far, forcing both hands up and away from his coat hem. “Got you,” he mutters, and shifts his grip to a painful angle that makes Pell’s shoulders bunch against the lantern pole. Pell jerks once, then stops—contained, but not calm.

The broad Lanternward doesn’t like being given orders, but he hears the practical sense in them. Without fully releasing Mara, he barks, “Mara stays down. Tolan, keep him. Pell—don’t make this worse.”

He drags Mara a half-step farther from the yew edge and the dropped cloth, pinning her wrists together with one hand while he reaches to his belt with the other. A short length of cord comes free; he starts binding her wrists.

Mara turns her face sideways against the grass, voice tight with pain. “He’ll wake wrong,” she says, words clipped. “You think that’s mercy?”

The broad Lanternward snaps back, “Mercy is *air*.”

He then strides to the slumped stranger by the headstone base, keeping his head turned away from where the ether-cloth lies. He crouches, checks the man’s chest with a gloved palm, then grips his jaw and tilts his face up into the wind. “Breathe,” he orders, as if the word can be enforced.

The stranger’s eyelids flutter. He inhales—shallow, then deeper—coughs once, and swallows hard. His gaze latches briefly on the broad Lanternward’s lantern, unfocused but present.

As the broad Lanternward shifts him more upright, something drops from the stranger’s coat pocket and lands with a soft, papery slap on the gravel: a folded square—too clean to be cemetery litter.

The broad Lanternward notices it a beat later. He doesn’t pick it up yet. His eyes lift, scanning the yew line and the blue-guttering lanterns beyond, as if expecting someone to step out and claim it.

**Clear, present danger:** Mara is bound but still fighting and could still lunge for the ether-cloth if she gets a hand free; Pell is restrained but watching for an opening; and the dropped folded paper is now exposed on the gravel—potential evidence or a signal—while the area may still have unseen accomplices nearby.

### Turn 36 [PLAYER]

I keep my boot pinning Pell and call out, “Don’t touch it bare—use a glove or cloth. That paper’s evidence.”  
Then, louder toward the yews, I add, “If anyone’s out there watching, show yourself—this isn’t getting cleaner.”  
Without taking my eyes off Pell, I ask Tolan under my breath, “Can you hold him alone for ten seconds if I move the ether rag farther off?”

*Agent reasoning: That folded paper feels like the first real thread in this mess—if someone else is watching, it could be a signal. I need it secured without letting Mara or Pell exploit the moment, and I want the Lanternward to treat it as evidence, not trash.*

### Turn 37 [GAME]

The broad Lanternward pauses over the folded paper, then nods once—tight, reluctant. He pulls a glove fully onto his right hand (he’d had it half-on), pinches the paper by one corner, and lifts it as if it might bite. He doesn’t unfold it yet. He holds it up to the lantern’s blue-sputtering light, angling it to catch any ink bleed-through.

At your louder call toward the yews, nothing obligingly steps out.

What you get instead is a sound: a faint *double-click* from deeper in the greenery, like two stones tapped together. Then a second, farther left. Not speech—signal.

Pell’s eyes snap toward the yews at the first click. His jaw loosens in something like satisfaction. Under your boot his fingers try to curl, testing your balance, but Tolan tightens his hold on Pell’s wrists and forces them up higher.

Tolan answers you under his breath without looking away from Pell. “Ten seconds?” He swallows. “Yes. But if he bucks, I’m breaking something.”

Mara, wrists bound, lifts her head enough to rasp, “They’re not going to show themselves. That’s not how—” The broad Lanternward cuts her off with a sharp tug on the cord, forcing her back down.

The stranger by the headstone base takes a deeper breath and then a sudden, wet cough. He doubles forward, retches once—mostly air and a thin spit—and his gaze clears just enough to snag on *you*, then Pell, then the glove-held paper. His lips part as if to speak, but only a hoarse whisper comes out: “Map… not… theirs…”

The broad Lanternward, still crouched, finally unfolds the paper one careful crease at a time.

It’s a maintenance overlay—thin vellum, inked with plot lines and narrow dotted routes that don’t match any public cemetery map. In the margin: three looping letters in an old shorthand—familiar enough to make your stomach dip, even at a glance.

The lantern beside you flares a brighter, attentive blue for a heartbeat, throwing everyone’s shadows long and sharp across the mausoleum face—your profile clear as a cutout.

And from the path below, a voice calls out with practiced cheer, closing in through the fog: “Oh! There you all are—what a *busy* little scene. Are we having an after-hours tour?”

A Lanternward tour-guide is drifting up the gravel walk, smile already in place, eyes aimed like hooks at your hands and tools and stance over Pell. The threat is immediate and social as much as physical: someone official is arriving to control the story.

### Turn 38 [PLAYER]

I ease my boot off Pell’s hand but keep my weight ready, lifting both palms a fraction like I’m de-escalating. “Not a tour,” I call down to the approaching guide, steady and loud. “An assault—ether. We’ve got two restrained and one half-suffocated. Get a medic and keep your people back.”  

Without looking away, I murmur to Tolan, “Hold him—don’t break him unless you have to.” Then I flick my eyes to the broad Lanternward and tip my chin toward the unfolded vellum. “That shorthand—bag it. Now.”

*Agent reasoning: A tour-guide means optics and narrative control; I need to look nonviolent, protect evidence, and quietly signal the broad Lanternward that the map matters. Also, the ether rag is still a hazard—if I can move it without losing Pell, I should, but not if it makes us look guilty.*

### Turn 39 [GAME]

Pell’s hand snaps back to his chest the moment your boot lifts. He cradles it, flexing his fingers with a grimace—hurt, but functional. He immediately tries to twist his shoulders to slip Tolan’s hold.

Tolan adjusts fast, planting a knee between Pell’s shoulder blades and hauling both wrists higher. “Stay,” Tolan growls. Pell sucks in a breath through his teeth but doesn’t get free.

Down the path, the Lanternward guide slows—then keeps coming anyway, boots crunching gravel with deliberate calm. She’s in a neat coat with a silver lantern pin; her hair is pinned back so tightly it looks painful. Her smile doesn’t reach her eyes.

“A medic,” she repeats, as if tasting the word. “Of course. We’ll see to everyone’s… comfort.” She lifts a small whistle from her pocket but doesn’t blow it yet. Instead she looks past you to the broad Lanternward and the vellum. “Steward Halden—what is that in your hand?”

Halden (broad Lanternward) hesitates a fraction at your “bag it” order—then chooses speed over argument. He snaps the vellum closed, keeping his glove on, and shoves it into the inside pocket of his coat. Not bagged—hidden on his person.

He says, loud enough for the guide to hear, “Found on the ground. Potentially connected.”

The guide’s gaze flicks to Mara, bound in the grass. “Mara? Really?” Her tone turns gently disappointed, like a teacher catching a child with ink-stained fingers. Mara’s eyes burn up at her, but she stays down, breathing hard.

The slumped stranger coughs again and manages a rasped sentence toward Halden: “Don’t—give—her—” He chokes on the last word and swallows, eyes watering.

The guide raises the whistle to her lips.

At the same time, from the yews comes a sharper sound than before: a single click, then a low, drawn-out *moan*—not a voice, not quite a bell, but close enough that the blue lanterns along the upper path answer with a brief sputter in sequence.

Halden’s head jerks toward the yews. His hand goes to the pocket where he stuffed the vellum.

The immediate threat is now twofold and concrete: the guide is about to summon more Lanternward with her whistle—likely to seize control of everyone and the evidence—while whatever is signaling from the yews is coordinating movement nearby, and Pell is watching both, poised to exploit the distraction.

### Turn 40 [PLAYER]

I step toward the guide with my palms still up, voice calm but edged. “Don’t blow that. We have an active ether incident and an unknown signal in the yews—your whistle will draw people straight into it.”

I glance to Halden and jerk my chin toward the mausoleum shadow. “Halden—bag the vellum properly, now. Away from her and away from your pocket.” Then I call, “Tolan, keep Pell facedown—don’t let him watch the yews.”

Without waiting for permission, I angle my body between the guide and the scene and add, quieter but firm, “If you’re here to ‘see to comfort,’ then get your medic and keep the rest back until we know who’s clicking in the trees.”

*Agent reasoning: The guide’s whistle will turn this into a controlled narrative and we’ll lose the map; I need to stop that without escalating into a brawl, and get Halden to secure evidence properly. The yew signals mean someone’s coordinating—keep eyes up and buy seconds.*

### Turn 42 [PLAYER]

I step in front of the guide, palms up in a steadying gesture. “Don’t blow that—there’s ether in the air and someone signaling in the yews. A whistle brings more people into the danger.”  
I cut my eyes to Halden and jerk my chin toward the mausoleum shadow. “Halden—bag the vellum properly, now. Not your pocket.” Then, sharp to Tolan: “Keep Pell facedown—don’t let him watch the trees.”

*Agent reasoning: The guide’s whistle could turn this into a pile of bodies and confiscated evidence; I need to slow her down and get Halden to secure the vellum properly while keeping Pell from coordinating with whoever’s in the yews.*

### Turn 43 [GAME]

You get between the guide and the knot of bodies, forcing her to either stop or bump you. She stops short—close enough you can see the salt-fine mist beading on her lashes. The whistle is at her lips, but she doesn’t blow it yet.

Her eyes track your raised hands, then flick past your shoulder to Pell and the stranger. “Ether,” she repeats, voice low now, the cheer gone. “That’s a serious accusation, Miss Ashford.”

She lowers the whistle a few inches—not pocketing it, just holding it ready. “If there’s ether, you move people *downwind* and you don’t crowd a casualty.” Her gaze hooks on the slumped stranger. “Halden—get him onto the path. Now.”

Halden hears your order and makes a quick decision in the mausoleum’s shadow. He pulls a small oilskin evidence pouch from his belt—creased, used—and, keeping his glove on, transfers the folded vellum from his coat pocket into the pouch without fully exposing it again. He rolls the top, ties it off, and then—importantly—doesn’t keep it. He sets it on the mausoleum’s stone ledge behind his boot, out of the guide’s direct line of sight but not in anyone’s hands.

The guide notices the movement anyway. Her chin lifts. “What did you just bag?”

“Found property,” Halden answers, too neutral. He doesn’t offer it.

Tolan obeys immediately: he shoves Pell’s cheek into the grass and shifts his knee higher across Pell’s shoulder blades, forcing Pell’s face away from the yews. Pell snarls something muffled and tries to crane his neck; Tolan yanks his wrists up hard enough that Pell grunts and stops trying.

From the yews, the signaling changes. You hear two quick clicks—closer than before—followed by a soft scuff of shoes on damp leaves. Someone is moving, using the cover. The threat is no longer abstract: there is at least one unseen person repositioning in the trees within a few yards.

The guide’s thumb tightens on the whistle. “If someone’s in those yews,” she says, voice clipped, “we call lanterns. That’s procedure.”

She takes one half-step to angle around you for a clearer sightline—testing whether you’ll let her past—while her eyes dart between the yews and the bagged vellum’s location.

### Turn 44 [PLAYER]

I shift with her half-step, keeping my body between her and the scene. “Procedure doesn’t outrank safety—if you call lanterns, you call them to the *lower gate* and you keep them out of this drift.”

I cut my gaze to Halden. “Get the casualty downwind onto the path, then stand on that pouch like it’s your oath.” Then I raise my voice toward the yews, steady and cold: “I hear you moving. Step out with your hands visible, or I start naming what you’re doing to every lantern that arrives.”

*Agent reasoning: The guide’s about to escalate and pull more people into a potentially gassed area; I need to keep her contained, get eyes on the yews, and secure the evidence without letting her seize it.*

### Turn 45 [GAME]

You mirror the guide’s angle perfectly. She can’t get a clean line past you without putting hands on you—and she doesn’t. Her jaw tightens.

“Lower gate,” she repeats. The whistle hovers at her mouth again, and she makes a sharp, decisive choice: she blows it once—short, controlled, not a long alarm. The sound is bright and cutting.

A heartbeat later, somewhere below the tier, you hear it answered: one whistle back, farther off, and the faint clatter of a lantern pole against stone as someone starts moving.

Halden moves on your instruction, but he doesn’t do it gently. He hooks his arms under the slumped stranger’s shoulders and drags him onto the path, boots scraping gravel. The stranger’s head lolls; he coughs wetly and tries to speak, failing. Halden then steps back to the mausoleum ledge and plants his boot squarely in front of the oilskin pouch—blocking it with his shin like a guard at a threshold.

Tolan keeps Pell pinned facedown. Pell’s eyes squeeze shut against the grass; he stops straining his neck and instead goes very still, listening.

Your call into the yews lands. The scuffing stops.

Then, from the dark under the branches, a voice answers—soft, close, and amused in a way that doesn’t match the situation. “Naming? To lanterns?” A pause. “You think they don’t already know the words?”

A figure doesn’t step out. Instead, a small object arcs from the yews and lands on the path with a light *clink* about six feet from the casualty: a glass vial, stoppered, rolling to a stop.

It’s not smoking. But the air around it has a sharp, sweet-cold bite that makes the back of your throat prickle—the same wrongness you’ve tasted near fresh-cut stone dust and blue-guttering lanterns.

The guide’s posture changes instantly: she grabs your forearm—not hard enough to bruise, hard enough to move you—trying to pull you back from the vial and clear her sightline. “No one touches that,” she snaps, eyes fixed on the glass.

From the yews comes one more click—right, then left—like someone signaling to two positions.

Whatever is in the trees is coordinating, and the vial on the path is now a clear, immediate hazard between you and the casualty.

### Turn 46 [PLAYER]

I let the guide pull me back a step, then gently peel her hand off my forearm. “Agreed—no one touches it. But you don’t get to move me like furniture.”

I angle my body so the breeze hits my face, then point with two fingers. “Halden, drag him farther downwind—now. Tolan, keep Pell pinned and quiet.”

Without taking my eyes off the yews, I call out, steady as stone: “You just tossed a vial at a dying man. Step out and say what it is, or when Lanternward arrive I’ll tell them you tried to gas a casualty—loud enough for the whole tier to hear.”

*Agent reasoning: Wren is cautious around chemicals and evidence; she won’t touch the vial, but she’ll control the guide’s grip, protect the casualty, and try to flush the hidden watcher into revealing themselves while keeping everyone downwind.*

### Turn 47 [GAME]

The guide lets her hand be removed, but her eyes stay hard on you for a beat—measuring. “Fine,” she says through her teeth. “Don’t be furniture. Be *useful*.”

Halden doesn’t argue. He grips the casualty under the arms again and hauls him farther along the path, boots skidding on gravel as he drags the man past a lantern base and away from the vial. The stranger coughs once—violent—and a thread of dark spit hits the stone. He’s breathing, but it’s shallow and fast.

Tolan keeps Pell pinned, shifting his weight to keep Pell’s chest from twisting. “Quiet,” Tolan growls. Pell makes a small, furious sound and then—like a sulking child—goes limp, conserving himself.

Your threat into the yews buys you one thing: movement. Not surrender—repositioning.

A shadow detaches from the yew line on the *left*—not stepping into the open, just edging to where you can see a sleeve and a hand braced against a trunk. The hand is gloved. In it: a short lantern-hook pole, the kind used to snuff and raise wicks. Its metal tip gleams.

The voice speaks again, now closer on that side. “Gas?” A soft laugh. “No. That’s for waking.”

Then, on the *right* side of the yews, you hear a quick scrape and see a second shape move—low, crouched—crossing behind headstones. Two positions, like the clicks suggested. One is a distraction; the other is trying to flank.

The vial on the path suddenly beads with condensation, as if the air around it has cooled. The sweet-cold bite strengthens. Your eyes sting slightly. It’s not spreading like fog yet, but it’s getting more active—either reacting to air or to time.

The guide raises her whistle again, but this time she doesn’t blow it—she points it at you like a warning. “Lanternward will come from the lower gate,” she says, tight and fast. “But if you keep antagonizing whoever’s in those trees, they’ll run—or they’ll strike.”

Down the tier, footsteps and the bobbing glow of a lantern are now visible through the mist: two Lanternward coming up at a brisk pace, poles in hand. They’re still half a minute out.

Immediate threats are now clear and present:
- the vial is “activating” in the open path near you (irritant/ether-like effect increasing),
- one person in the yews has a metal hook-pole and line of sight,
- another is moving low behind stones to your right, attempting to get around you before help arrives.

### Turn 48 [PLAYER]

I tug my scarf up over my nose and mouth and gesture the guide back with two sharp fingers. “Cover your face—get behind the mausoleum. If that blooms, it’ll take your lungs first.”

Keeping low, I grab a loose handful of gravel and snap it hard toward the left yew-line—aiming for the gloved hand and lantern-hook pole—then pivot and shout to the incoming Lanternward, “Yews—two hostiles! One left with a hook-pole, one flanking right behind the stones!”

Without looking away from the trees, I call to Halden, “Use your pole—pin the vial under stone or kick grit over it from a distance, don’t touch it!”

*Agent reasoning: The vial feels like it’s about to bloom into something that’ll drop all of us, and there are two attackers trying to split our attention. I’m not strong enough to fight them, but I can control space and buy seconds until Lanternward arrive—without letting the guide take charge of the evidence or the narrative.*

### Turn 49 [GAME]

You get your scarf up in time; the sweet-cold sting still creeps into your eyes, but it’s dulled. Your two-finger gesture snaps the guide out of her stance. She doesn’t argue—she ducks back behind the mausoleum corner, pressing her own scarf to her mouth. “You’d better be right,” she mutters, and stays low.

You scoop gravel and whip it into the left yew-line.

It hits. A sharp *tink* on metal, then a grunt. The gloved hand jerks back; the lantern-hook pole clatters once against the trunk and dips out of sight. Leaves shiver violently where the gravel tore through.

But it also gives away your exact angle.

A split-second later, something lashes out from that same left-side cover: the hook-pole swings back into view, arcing fast and low toward the open path—not at you, but at the vial. The metal tip *hooks* the vial’s neck and drags it a foot across the stone with a squeal of glass.

The stoppered vial doesn’t break. It skitters, spins, and leaves a wet-looking track of condensation on the path. The air bite spikes—your eyes water hard even through the scarf.

On your right, the flanking shape commits: a crouched figure darts from behind a headstone, closing the gap toward Halden’s position. You see a pale sleeve and a hand holding something small and dark—too compact to be a pole, more like a tool or knife.

Your shout reaches the incoming Lanternward. Both of them accelerate instantly, poles coming up. “LEFT YEW!” one calls back, voice rough. The other veers right, trying to cut off the flanker’s line.

Halden reacts to your order with the only leverage he has: he grabs a flat, palm-sized stone from the path edge with his boot and kicks it—hard—so it skids and slaps over the vial. It doesn’t pin it perfectly, but it partially covers it, and the glass stops rolling.

The effect changes: instead of “activating” in the open air, the sting becomes a concentrated, sharp plume seeping around the stone’s edges—still dangerous, but less widespread.

The casualty, downwind, coughs again and curls inward, trying to get his face away from the air. He’s conscious enough to flinch.

The left yew attacker retreats a half-step deeper—branches swallowing the hook-pole again—while the right-side flanker is now within a few strides of Halden and the casualty, moving fast and low.

Immediate threat: the flanker is about to reach Halden/casualty; the vial is partially covered but still venting irritant around the stone; Lanternward are closing but not yet in contact.

### Turn 50 [PLAYER]

I stay low and rush two steps toward the flanker’s line, then snatch up my lantern-hook pole and sweep it hard across the gravel in front of their knees to trip them. “Halden—back, keep him behind you!” I bark, then shout to the Lanternward on the right, “They’re on Halden—now, now!”

*Agent reasoning: The flanker is the immediate danger to Halden and the casualty; I’m not a fighter, but I can distract and use the cemetery terrain. I want to protect the vulnerable and keep eyes off the vial while Lanternward close in.*

### Turn 51 [GAME]

You surge two steps and sweep your lantern-hook pole low across the gravel.

The flanker tries to hop it—too late. The pole catches the front of their shins with a dull *thunk* and their feet skid on the loose stones. They pitch forward, hands shooting out. Whatever they were holding—a compact, dark-handled tool—flies from their grip and skips across the path, disappearing into the grass by the mausoleum’s edge.

They hit the ground hard on one shoulder and roll, fast and practiced, trying to get their legs under them again. Close enough now, you catch details: a cemetery work-coat, salt-stained at the cuffs; a scarf tied high; and a smear of pale clay on one glove like fresh stone dust.

“Halden—back, keep him behind you!” you bark.

Halden obeys, hauling the casualty another half-step downwind and putting his own body squarely between the fallen attacker and the man on the ground. He raises his pole defensively like a quarterstaff, breathing through his teeth. “Stay DOWN,” he snaps.

Your shout to the right-side Lanternward lands at exactly the right moment. The Lanternward who’d veered right closes the last yards at a run and brings their pole down—not striking the attacker’s head, but jabbing the ferrule into the attacker’s hip and ribs to pin them to the gravel.

“Hands!” the Lanternward barks. “Hands where I can see them!”

The attacker freezes for a fraction of a second… then does something uglier: they twist their torso and slam their palm into the gravel, crushing something small under their glove. There’s a sharp *crack*—like a vial or ampoule breaking.

A thin, icy-white vapor puffs up around their hand and along the ground, hugging low like it’s heavier than air. It’s not a big cloud yet, but it’s spreading toward Halden’s boots and the casualty’s legs.

The Lanternward recoils half a step, swearing, and yanks their scarf up over their mouth. “Brine-sweet!” they rasp. “Don’t breathe it!”

From the left yews, the hook-pole scrapes stone again—still there, still moving—while the partially covered vial near the path continues to vent a sharp plume around the stone.

Right now the clear threats are:
- a new low-lying vapor spreading from the flanker’s crushed ampoule toward Halden and the casualty,
- the original vial still venting near the path,
- the left-side attacker remains in the yews with a hook-pole, uncontained.

### Turn 52 [PLAYER]

I yank my scarf tighter and grab Halden’s sleeve, pulling him and the casualty two quick steps uphill and away from the ground-hugging vapor. “Up—higher ground, now. Don’t let it crawl into his mouth.”  

Then I stab my pole toward the left yews without advancing. “Lanternward—one still in the yews with a hook-pole! Keep your distance; don’t let them drag that first vial free.” I glance at the pinned attacker and snap, “What did you just break—what is it?”

*Agent reasoning: The vapor is the immediate lethal risk—get the casualty and Halden out of the low cloud; also keep the left yew attacker from interfering while Lanternward secure the downed one.*

### Turn 53 [GAME]

You wrench your scarf tight and catch Halden by the sleeve. He goes with the pull immediately, dragging the casualty with him; the man’s heels scrape as you all retreat two quick steps uphill onto a slightly higher ribbon of path.

It helps. The ground-hugging vapor keeps low, spilling like cold breath across the gravel where the attacker cracked the ampoule. It curls around the Lanternward’s boots and Halden’s *former* position, but it doesn’t climb fast. The casualty coughs once, wet and panicked, then manages a thin inhale through clenched teeth—still conscious, still in trouble, but you’ve kept the worst of it from pouring straight into his face.

Your pole-stab toward the left yews draws eyes. The second Lanternward (the one who’d been coming up the path) plants their pole and swings their lantern high, trying to light the yew line without stepping into it. “I see movement,” they call—voice muffled behind cloth. “Stay out of the brush!”

In answer, the left-side attacker makes their play anyway: the hook-pole shoots out from the foliage and *snags the edge* of the flat stone Halden kicked over the first vial. Metal grates on stone; the cover shifts a few inches.

The plume around that first vial strengthens again, sharper and more immediate, and you feel it sting your eyes even uphill.

The Lanternward with the raised lantern jabs their pole forward and pins the hook-pole against a headstone corner with a hard, practiced shove—metal-on-metal *clang*. “Drop it!” they bark into the yews. “Lanternward—drop it now!”

At your question, the pinned attacker—still held at the ribs/hip by the other Lanternward’s pole—turns their head just enough for you to see their eyes above the scarf: grey, watering, furious.

They spit words like they hurt. “Moon-salt. Brine-sweet. Same thing you people keep pretending is folklore.” They cough once, then add, quieter and uglier: “It keeps you quiet. Keeps you… *compliant*.”

Their gloved hand flexes, grinding shards into the gravel.

Immediate threats are now:
- the first vial’s irritant plume is increasing again because its cover was shifted,
- the left yew attacker is still engaged and trying to free/drag that vial with the hook-pole,
- the broken ampoule’s low vapor continues to spread along the ground where the pinned attacker fell—less dangerous uphill, but it’s contaminating the area around the Lanternward holding them.

### Turn 54 [PLAYER]

“Compliant,” I repeat under my breath, anger sharp in my chest. Then I look to Halden. “Get him uphill to clean air—keep his face turned into the wind. Don’t stop.”

I call to the Lanternward with the raised lantern, voice tight through my scarf: “Don’t wrestle the hook—*break their leverage*. Pin it and step on it if you have to.” Then, keeping my distance, I scrape my boot through the gravel and kick a broad fan of grit and dirt over the shifted stone and the vial’s edges, trying to smother the plume without getting close enough to breathe it.

My eyes cut back to the pinned attacker. “Who sent you? And where did you get moon-salt?”

*Agent reasoning: Wren’s protective instincts kick in—get the casualty farther from both vapors, and use her cemetery know-how to smother the vial without touching it. She’s also rattled by “compliant” and wants names and motives, but not at the cost of someone dying.*

### Turn 55 [GAME]

Halden doesn’t argue. He braces the casualty under the arms and hauls him uphill, turning the man’s face into the wind like you said. “Breathe with me—short,” he orders, and keeps moving. The casualty’s coughs thin out into harsh, shallow pulls; he’s not fine, but he’s getting air.

Your instruction to the lantern-raised Lanternward lands. They stop trying to “win” the hook-pole and instead *kill the angle*: they slam their own pole down across it and put a boot on the shaft, grinding it against the headstone corner until the yew-side attacker loses purchase.

There’s a sharp crack—wood under strain—and the hook-pole end *splinters*. The yew-side attacker jerks back, suddenly holding a shortened, broken length.

A second later, a figure bolts from the yews—not toward you, but sideways, using the brush as cover. They’re fast and low, scarf up, coat flapping. The Lanternward’s lantern swings after them, but the beam catches only the white flash of a sleeve and then nothing but trembling branches. Footfalls retreat into the terraces.

Your boot-scrape and kick do what you intended, but not neatly. The fan of grit and dirt skitters over the shifted stone and the vial’s exposed edge. The plume *thickens for a breath* as you disturb it—your eyes sting hard and tears spill despite the scarf—then the dirt begins to cake over the stoppered glass and the stone settles back down. The venting drops from a sharp “bite” to a thinner seep.

You’ve reduced the immediate spread, but you’ve also made a messy, contaminated patch of gravel that will keep irritating anyone who steps into it.

Behind you, the pinned attacker flinches at your questions, then goes still. Their eyes flick—not to your face, but to the lantern-glass, catching their own reflection for a heartbeat as if checking what it reveals.

A voice answers from the path behind the mausoleum, bright with too-perfect politeness: “Oh—goodness. Is someone hurt?”

A cheerful tide-singer stands there in a damp wool cloak, hands folded as if in prayer. She looks from the casualty being hauled uphill to the grit-smeared vial patch, and then to you.

The pinned attacker’s gaze snaps to her and shuts like a door.

Under the Lanternward’s pole, the attacker rasps, “No one *sent* me.”

Then, after a pause that’s almost a dare: “Ask the Choir where they keep their ‘blessings.’”

The tide-singer’s smile doesn’t move, but her eyes do—down to the ground, to the vapor hugging the gravel, measuring distance like she’s counting steps.

### Turn 56 [PLAYER]

I step sideways to put myself between the tide-singer and the contaminated gravel, keeping my pole low like a barrier. “Yes—someone’s hurt, and the ground’s fouled. Stay where you are and cover your face.”

Without taking my eyes off her, I call to the Lanternward, “Keep her back from the vapor—don’t let anyone walk through that patch.” Then I look down at the pinned attacker. “If you’re so eager to talk, start with a name—yours—or I let Lanternward decide how long you sit in irons.”

*Agent reasoning: The tide-singer’s timing feels wrong, and the attacker just pointed at the Choir; I need to protect the casualty and keep the scene controlled without provoking a panic.*

### Turn 57 [GAME]

You slide sideways and get your body between the tide-singer and the fouled gravel, pole held low like a gate. It works: she stops short, cloak hem hovering just shy of the dirty, stinging patch. She doesn’t argue—she lifts the edge of her sleeve to her mouth with a practiced motion, like she’s done it before.

One Lanternward (the one not pinning the attacker) immediately shifts to your call. He angles his lantern to mark the contaminated ground and points with the butt of his pole. “No one steps here,” he orders, voice rough. He positions himself half a pace behind the tide-singer, not touching her, but ready to block her retreat or advance.

The tide-singer’s eyes flick to that Lanternward, then back to you. “I only came because I heard shouting,” she says, polite as a pamphlet. “If there’s been… an incident… the Choir can provide clean cloth and vinegar. For the lungs.”

Behind you uphill, Halden is still moving with the casualty; you hear him call, “He’s wheezing—keep him awake!” Their footsteps fade a little farther up the tier.

When you drop your gaze to the pinned attacker and demand a name, they tense under the pole. The Lanternward holding them presses the ferrule in harder; the attacker lets out a short grunt, then forces their breathing shallow through the scarf.

For a moment they look like they’ll spit defiance again—then their eyes cut to the tide-singer, and their bravado falters.

“Jory,” they rasp finally. “Jory Latch.”

The tide-singer’s head tilts a fraction at the name—small, almost involuntary. She covers it quickly with a soft, concerned sound. “Oh. Jory.”

Jory’s gaze hardens at her. “Don’t,” they hiss.

The danger shifts rather than vanishes:
- the fouled gravel patch is still active; anyone stepping into it will get stinging eyes and coughing fits, especially downwind
- Jory is restrained but conscious and desperate; their hands are free enough to try another concealed trick if they have one
- the tide-singer is staying put, but she’s now clearly connected to the name you got, and she’s watching the scene with careful attention—not panic

### Turn 58 [PLAYER]

I keep my pole low between us and the fouled gravel and fix the tide-singer with a steady look. “You know him. Name, rank—what do you call yourself, and why does ‘Jory Latch’ make you flinch?”

Without looking away, I call to the Lanternward pinning Jory, “Bind their hands—now. Check their pockets for more glass.” Then, quieter to Jory, “If the Choir didn’t send you, tell me who taught you to carry moon-salt into a graveyard.”

*Agent reasoning: The tide-singer’s reaction to Jory’s name feels like a thread worth tugging, but the immediate priority is keeping everyone out of the contaminated patch and getting the casualty help; I’ll press the tide-singer for specifics while making sure Jory can’t pull another trick.*

### Turn 59 [GAME]

The tide-singer’s polite mask tightens—not a smile anymore, just a controlled line. She keeps her sleeve over her mouth and answers as if reciting something approved.

“Maris Pell,” she says. “Brine-Choir—shore steward.” Her eyes stay on you, but her attention keeps darting to the lantern marking the contaminated patch. “And I didn’t flinch. I recognized a congregant.”

Jory makes a small, involuntary sound—half laugh, half choke. “Congregant,” they spit. “That what we are now.”

At your order, the Lanternward pinning Jory doesn’t waste time. He barks, “Hands. Now.” When Jory hesitates, the ferrule digs in again. Jory’s hands come forward.

The other Lanternward steps in with cord from his belt—rough twine that smells of tar—and binds Jory’s wrists tight. As he does, he pats down Jory’s coat and trouser pockets with quick, practiced strikes.

“More glass,” he mutters, and pulls out:
- a second small ampoule wrapped in waxed paper (unbroken),
- a flat tin with a salt-crusted seam,
- and a narrow tool—like a grave-rubbing pick, but sharper.

Maris’s gaze fixes on the flat tin. For the first time her composure slips; she takes one step back—straight into the Lanternward’s space behind her—then stops herself.

“Careful,” she says, voice suddenly urgent. “Don’t open that here.”

The Lanternward pauses, tin in hand, looking to his partner. “Is it more of the same?”

Your quieter question to Jory lands differently than your threats. Jory’s shoulders sag a fraction, as if the bindings have made honesty cheaper.

“They taught us at the lantern-shed,” Jory whispers, eyes reddened and watering. “Not the Choir. Not—” Their gaze flicks to Maris and away. “A man with ink-stained fingers. Said it was ‘for keeping order.’ Said the cemetery’s been… drifting.”

Maris’s eyes go sharp at that. “You’re lying,” she says, but she doesn’t sound sure—she sounds frightened of what it would mean if Jory isn’t.

Downhill, the fouled patch still breathes thinly where you kicked grit over it. The wind shifts once, and the sting reaches your eyes again—warning you that if anyone opens that tin, whatever’s inside could ride the same air.

### Turn 60 [PLAYER]

“Don’t open it,” I say sharply, eyes flicking to the tin. “Wrap it back up—double cloth—and get it uphill with Halden, out of this air.”

I turn my steady stare on Maris. “Shore steward, then steward the truth: why does that tin scare you, and who in the Lanternward has ink-stained fingers?” 

Then, to Jory, quieter but hard: “Which lantern-shed. When. And did you come for Halden, or for what’s buried here?”

*Agent reasoning: The tin sounds dangerous and the wind’s shifting; I need it contained and everyone kept out of the fouled air. Jory’s “lantern-shed” detail feels like a lead, and Maris’s reaction suggests she knows more than she’s saying—press her, but keep it controlled.*

### Turn 62 [PLAYER]

“Don’t open it,” I snap at the Lanternward with the tin. “Wrap it—double cloth—and take it uphill to Halden, out of this air.”

I square my shoulders toward Maris, pole still low as a barrier. “Shore steward, then steward the truth: why does that tin scare you, and which Lanternward has ink-stained fingers?”

Then I tip my head down to Jory, voice tight and low. “Which lantern-shed. When. And did you come for Halden— or for what’s buried here?”

*Agent reasoning: The tin feels like the next disaster waiting to happen, so I need it moved to clean air; Maris and Jory both reacted to it, so pressing them now might crack the story before anyone runs.*

### Turn 63 [GAME]

The Lanternward with the tin freezes at your snap, then obeys fast. He yanks off his own neck-cloth, folds it twice around the salt-crusted tin, and knots it with tarry twine until it’s a bundled brick. He doesn’t hand it off—he keeps it at arm’s length like it might bite.

“Up,” his partner orders, and the man moves uphill at a quick walk, staying upwind of the fouled gravel as best he can. As he passes, he calls toward the fading commotion above, “Halden—sealed item coming up! Don’t open—keep it out of air!”

Maris watches the bundle go with a look that’s half relief, half dread. When you press her, she draws her sleeve down just enough to speak clearly.

“That tin is brine-tithe,” she says. “Not salt. Not incense. It’s… what the drowned pay with when they want a name changed. When they want a ledger to forget.” Her eyes flick to the lantern-marked contamination. “If it’s opened in a living wind, it clings. It finds mouths.”

On “ink-stained fingers,” she hesitates. The hesitation is real; she’s choosing which danger to invite.

“There’s a clerk,” she says finally, voice tighter. “Lanternward-adjacent. Keeps the tour lists and the maintenance notes. Always smells of iron-gall ink. Everyone calls him Mr. Sallow. I don’t know his given name.”

At your last questions, Jory’s jaw works as if they’re chewing grit. Bound wrists flex uselessly against the twine.

“North lantern-shed,” Jory answers, breathy. “By the yew walk. Two nights ago—after the last tour. He—Sallow—said Halden was ‘too curious’ and you were ‘too careful.’ Said you’d both start noticing the plot shifts.”

Jory swallows, eyes darting past you toward the stones, toward the tier where the lanterns burn wrong.

“I didn’t come for Halden,” they say. “Not first. I came for the coordinates. For the grave that doesn’t want to stay in its own family. We were told it would be here tonight—because the blue lanterns would… show the path.”

Downhill, the fouled gravel patch stirs again as the wind shifts; your eyes sting, and Jory coughs once into their scarf despite themselves. The threat is immediate and practical: if the air turns toward you, you’ll all start tearing up and choking—bound or not—and anyone who panics could stumble straight into the contaminated strip.

### Turn 64 [PLAYER]

I tug my scarf higher and gesture with my pole. “Everyone upwind—now. Two paces back from the marked ground, no heroics.” 

I fix Maris with a hard look as I herd her with the pole’s tip. “You’re coming uphill with us, Maris. If brine-tithe changes ledgers, then you tell me whose name they’re trying to erase.” 

Then I lean close to Jory—careful of the air—and murmur, “Coordinates to what grave, Jory? Give me the family name on the stone, and tell me what the blue lanterns ‘show’—is it light, or something else?”

*Agent reasoning: The wind’s turning and the fouled patch is getting worse; I need to move us upwind, keep Maris from bolting, and lock down what “grave that doesn’t want to stay” means while Jory’s talking.*

### Turn 66 [PLAYER]

I pull my scarf up over my nose and motion with my pole. “Upwind—now. Two paces back from the marked ground. No heroics.”  
I herd Maris with the pole’s tip toward the uphill path. “You’re coming with us, Maris. If brine-tithe erases names, you tell me whose name they’re trying to wipe clean.”  
Then I lean in toward Jory, low and controlled. “Coordinates to which grave, Jory—family name on the stone. And the blue lanterns… do they *light* the path, or do they *pull* it?”

*Agent reasoning: The air is turning and the fouled gravel is still a hazard; I need to get everyone upwind and keep Maris close while pressing Jory for specifics before panic makes them clam up.*

### Turn 67 [GAME]

Your order cuts through the coughing and gawking. The two Lanternward on your side of the marked strip retreat immediately—boots scraping gravel as they take two full paces back, then another when the wind twitches. One of them drags a fallen lantern-hook with his heel to keep anyone from stepping forward.

Maris moves when you herd her, but not obediently—calculating. She keeps her face angled away from the contaminated patch and follows the uphill path, shoulders tight like she expects a hand on her collar at any moment.

“You don’t get to *take* me uphill,” she says through her scarf, then adds, quieter, “but you’re right about one thing: if that tin’s opened down here, we’ll have more than tears.”

At your demand—whose name—they reach the first bend where the wind is cleaner and the blue guttering is less direct. Maris stops, puts a palm on the iron rail, and finally answers in a clipped spill:

“They aren’t erasing a fisherman. They’re erasing a *witness*.” Her eyes flick to you. “A woman tied to Ashford & Daughters. Someone whose shorthand shows up where it shouldn’t.”

Behind you, Jory flinches when you lean in, then steadies—eyes red-rimmed from the sting. They angle their mouth toward your ear to keep their words from carrying.

“Not light,” Jory whispers. “It *pulls*. Like a tide under glass.”

They give you the grave as if reciting a lesson they hate: “Family name: **CROFT**. Plot used to be Croft—third tier, east of the rosemary row. But the stone won’t sit. The border keeps… correcting itself. Like it wants another family’s dirt.”

Jory’s gaze darts past you to the lanterns uphill. “The blue doesn’t show a path on the ground. It shows it in the *air*—a thin shimmer, like heat over tar. If you breathe it in, you start walking the line without meaning to.”

As if to prove the point, one of the Lanternward nearest the strip takes a half-step forward without thinking—eyes unfocused for a beat—then jolts back when his partner grabs his sleeve hard enough to tear a stitch.

Uphill, above the bend, a bell buoy moans once—too close to be from the shore—answered by a smaller, metal-on-metal click from somewhere within the cemetery structures. The north lantern-shed, if it’s open, just announced itself.

### Turn 68 [PLAYER]

I go very still at “Ashford & Daughters,” then keep moving, voice low. “Say her name, Maris—out loud. If it’s mine to carry, I’ll carry it.”

I wave the nearest Lanternward closer without letting them step downwind. “Two of you on Jory—eyes on their feet, no drifting. The rest with me to the north lantern-shed; scarves up, mouths closed if you can manage it.”

As we start uphill, I murmur to Jory, “If the blue starts pulling, you tell me before you move—do you hear anything when it happens, like surf in a shell?”

*Agent reasoning: The mention of a witness tied to my family and the lantern-shed click feels urgent; I need to keep everyone from breathing the “pull” while pressing Maris for specifics and moving toward the shed before evidence disappears.*

### Turn 69 [GAME]

Maris’s steps falter at your request. She looks at the iron guide-rail your hand brushed a moment ago, then at the lanterns, as if weighing which parts of the cemetery can “hear.”

“You don’t want that said here,” she mutters—too late, because you’ve already asked for it.

She swallows and says it anyway, sharp and resentful, pitched low but audible in the rail’s reach: “**Iris Ashford.**”

The effect is immediate and ugly.

A thin bell-buoy moan threads through the mist—closer than any shoreline buoy has a right to be—and the nearest lanterns along the tier dim half a shade, blue-sputtering like they’ve turned their wicks toward your voice. For two heartbeats the air feels tight, as if the cemetery is holding it.

A pale moth—thumbprint-sized, almost colorless—lifts from the nearest lantern-glass where it had been still as a fleck of ash. It flutters in a small, deliberate spiral, then darts away upslope toward the Lanternward office roofs, as if carrying the sound with it.

The Lanternward you beckon do exactly what you say: two fall in on Jory, each taking an elbow and keeping their own faces turned upwind. One of them—older, with a split thumbnail—keeps repeating, “Feet still. Eyes on me,” like a charm. The rest bunch with you toward the north lantern-shed, scarves up, mouths shut.

Jory answers your murmur without moving their feet, voice strained. “Yes. Like surf in a shell—only it’s… backwards. Like it’s pulling the sound *in*.”

You make it another dozen paces uphill when a figure steps out from between two leaning marbles ahead—close enough that they must have been waiting just off the path.

A Brine-Choir “volunteer,” by the sash and the neat hymn-book tucked under one arm. Their scarf is white, their smile practiced, and their eyes go straight to you.

“Wren Ashford,” they say softly, as if greeting you at a service. “I heard you were asking after your mother. The sea keeps excellent records, dear. Better than stone.”

They angle their body to block the cleanest line toward the north lantern-shed without looking like they’re blocking anything at all.

Behind you, from a side tier, a Lanternward caretaker in a dark apron appears and begins drifting parallel to your group—close enough to listen, far enough to claim coincidence—hand already on a ring of keys.

The threat is clear now: the name you drew out has sent an alert through the lantern network. The Choir has arrived to “help” on their terms, and Lanternward attention is closing in just as you try to reach the shed.

I stop just short of the volunteer’s “accidental” block, chin lifting the way I do with tourists who want to pocket sea-glass from graves. “Then you’ll know records can be forged—especially when they’re wet.”  

I angle my body sideways, not pushing past, just making it clear I’m not yielding the path. To the Lanternward behind me, I keep my voice low. “Keys—now. Open the north lantern-shed and hold it. No one goes in alone.”  

Then I look back to the volunteer, eyes steady over my scarf. “If you’ve come to *help*, you can start by telling me who’s paying brine-tithe to scrub Iris Ashford from ledgers.”  

Without waiting for an answer, I murmur to Jory, “If you feel the pull, lean into the Lanternward holding you—don’t fight it alone. And keep your mouth shut.”

*Agent reasoning: The Choir volunteer is trying to control the route and the conversation; I need access to the north lantern-shed without escalating into a scene. I’ll use polite cemetery-professional authority, keep my voice low to avoid “feeding” the lanterns, and redirect Lanternward to secure the shed while I distract the Choir and probe for what they know about my mother.*

My eyes settle back on the volunteer. “If you’ve come to help, tell me who’s paying brine-tithe to scrub Iris Ashford from the ledgers.” Then, without looking, I murmur to Jory, “If you feel the pull, lean into the Lanternward holding you—don’t fight it. Mouth shut.”

I shift one step to the side to keep the volunteer from fully blocking us, and I snap my fingers once at the caretaker with the keys. “Now—open the north lantern-shed and stand the door with me.”  

I keep my gaze on the volunteer. “If you’re here to offer hymns, save them. Who is paying brine-tithe to erase Iris Ashford?”  

Then I glance at Jory over my scarf. “Blink twice if you hear the surf-in-a-shell starting—don’t speak.”

*Agent reasoning: The silence feels like the air “pulling” again—dangerous to linger. I need the shed open to get out of the open tiers, and I want to keep the volunteer talking without letting them control the path.*

### Turn 75 [GAME]

Your sidestep keeps the path from becoming a full stop, but it also exposes what the volunteer was hiding: their stance isn’t casual—they’re planted to funnel you toward the open tier where the lanterns have the cleanest line of sight.

The caretaker with the keys—dark apron, salt-stiff sleeves—doesn’t hurry at your snap. He looks past you to the volunteer first, then to the two Lanternward bracing Jory. His jaw works once. Still, he peels off from the parallel drift and strides upslope, keys already in hand.

“North shed’s sealed for relamping,” he says, loud enough to be a rule rather than an answer. Then, lower, to you as he passes: “If you’re forcing it, you’re owning it.”

He reaches the north lantern-shed: a squat timber box with a copper vent cap and a door banded in iron. The key ring clinks. He tries the first key—wrong. Second—wrong. Third—**it turns**, but not cleanly. Something inside the lock resists like grit.

He puts his shoulder in, and the door opens a handspan with a wet-sounding sigh, as if the hinge has been recently oiled with something thicker than oil. A ribbon of cold, blue light leaks out at ankle height.

The Brine-Choir volunteer doesn’t answer your question directly. They smile wider, and their thumb strokes the hymn-book’s spine—one, two, three—like counting.

“Brine-tithe isn’t *payment*,” they say. “It’s **due**. And names aren’t erased, Wren. They’re… *moved to where they belong.*”

They tilt their chin toward the shed. “You should be careful what you open. The Lanternward hates a mess.”

At your glance, Jory blinks once—hard—then a second time, slower. The two Lanternward holding them tighten their grip automatically. Jory’s throat works as if swallowing water that isn’t there, but they keep their lips sealed.

Then the lanterns along your tier gutter in sequence—left to right—blue flames bowing as if in a wind that only they can feel. The “pull” hits the group as a physical tug: not enough to drag feet, but enough to make balance go wrong. Gravel skitters under boots.

From inside the shed comes a clear, small sound: **a tool laid carefully on wood**.

The caretaker freezes with the door half-open, keys still in his fist. “Someone’s in there,” he says, voice gone flat. “And they weren’t supposed to be.”

### Turn 76 [PLAYER]

I plant my boots wide and grab the shed door edge with my gloved hand, using it like an anchor. “Then we don’t go fishing in the dark—Caretaker, stay on the latch with me. Lanternward, form a line: one hand on the person ahead, keep your feet.”  

I lift my voice into the crack of blue light. “Whoever’s inside—hands where I can see them and step back from the door. I’m not here to hurt you, but I *will* shut this and seal you in if you make me.”  

Without turning my head, I snap softly, “Jory—eyes on me. Breathe through the cloth. Don’t look at the lanterns.” Then, to the volunteer, cold and careful: “You said names get moved. Tell me where Iris was ‘moved,’ or you can stand here and watch me start breaking locks.”

*Agent reasoning: The shed is the immediate danger and the source of the pull; I need to keep everyone anchored and prevent the Choir from controlling the scene. I’ll take the door with the caretaker, keep Jory safe, and force whoever’s inside to show hands before we enter.*

### Turn 77 [GAME]

Your grip on the iron-banded door works: the “pull” that’s upsetting everyone else’s balance tugs at your shoulders, but the door gives you something solid to argue with. The caretaker hesitates—then plants his boots beside yours and clamps his hand over the latch edge like he’s afraid it’ll bite.

The Lanternward nearest you try to comply. They string out into an awkward line, each with a hand on the next person’s sleeve or belt. It steadies them, but not cleanly—two of them stagger anyway when the lanterns gutter again, and their boots scrape half-moons in the gravel.

You call into the crack of blue light.

For a beat, nothing.

Then a shape shifts inside—just beyond the threshold—blocking the spill of light. A voice answers from low height, as if the speaker is crouched.

“Don’t—” it says, and the word catches like a hook in the throat. “Don’t close it.”

A hand appears first, palm out, fingers stained dark as if with ink or old varnish. Then the other. Slow, careful. Whoever it is keeps their body behind the doorframe.

The caretaker leans closer despite himself. “That’s… that’s lantern-oil,” he mutters, seeing the shine on the wrist. “Fresh.”

Behind you, Jory does what you asked: eyes fixed on you, breathing shallow through cloth. Their shoulders still twitch with the tide-pull, but they don’t turn toward the lanterns. One of the Lanternward holding them whispers a prayer through clenched teeth; another tightens their grip hard enough to leave a bruise.

The Brine-Choir volunteer’s smile thins at your threat. They don’t step back; they step *sideways*, angling so they can see into the shed as if they have a right.

“Iris wasn’t ‘moved’ to a place,” they say, voice suddenly precise. “She was moved to a **line**. A margin. A footnote that can be folded shut.”

They lift their hymn-book slightly, showing its damp-swollen pages. On the inside cover—pressed into the paper like a watermark—three looping letters in your mother’s shorthand.

“Ask your family’s annex,” the volunteer adds. “Ask what they keep when grief won’t stay buried.”

Inside the shed, the hidden person’s hands tremble. Something metallic scrapes on wood again—closer to the threshold now—like a tool being nudged into reach. The blue light flares once, brighter, and the lanterns along the tier answer with a synchronized bow.

The threat is immediate and physical: if the flare pulses again, the line of Lanternward may go down like toppled stones—and whoever’s inside may bolt through the gap while everyone’s footing fails.

### Turn 78 [PLAYER]

I tighten my grip on the door and hiss to the line, “Drop your center—knees bent. If you go, you go together; don’t break the chain.”  

Into the shed, gentler: “I won’t close it if you stay still. Tell me your name, and slide whatever tool that is away from the threshold—slow.”  

Then I cut my eyes to the Brine-Choir volunteer. “My family’s annex isn’t your hymn-book’s playground,” I say, voice like a blade. “You’re going to tell me what line she was moved to—whose ledger, whose hand—or you can back up and let me speak to the person you’ve cornered.”

*Agent reasoning: The blue flare is about to knock us all over; I need to steady the group and keep the person inside from bolting, while pressing the volunteer for something useful without letting them control the moment.*

### Turn 79 [GAME]

The line obeys—mostly. Two Lanternward bend their knees and lower their weight; one does it a heartbeat late and stumbles into the back of the person ahead. The chain holds, but their hands clutch tighter, knuckles whitening. The “pull” through the tier eases just enough that boots stop skittering.

Inside the shed, the unseen person answers your gentle voice with a sharp inhale.

“My—” they start, then stop, like the name hurts to shape.

A small metal tool—thin, hooked, familiar as a grave-knife or etching pick—scrapes across the floorboards. It doesn’t slide away from the threshold. It slides **toward** it, then pauses, as if the person’s arm is being argued with.

Their hands rise higher, palms still out. The lantern-oil sheen on their wrists catches the blue spill.

“I’m not supposed to have one,” they whisper. “If I put it down, it— it sees.”

The caretaker beside you swallows and keeps his hand on the latch, but his eyes flick to the mounting bracket above the door—where a chalk-salt scrawl sits half-hidden under the iron banding. He doesn’t touch it. He looks like he knows better.

Your blade-voice at the Brine-Choir volunteer lands. They finally take a step back—one pace, not a retreat, more like granting you “space” they think they control. Their hymn-book remains open, thumb still marking that inside cover.

“Whose hand?” they echo, and their gaze slides past you to the lantern-glass along the path, watching reflections. “You want a hand, Wren? Watch the ones that never get dirty.”

As they say it, a lamp-tender down the tier—trimming a wick, shooing moths from the glass—stills for half a second, then resumes with exaggerated calm. She doesn’t look at you directly; she watches you in the lantern pane, counting with her thumb against the oil-can.

The blue light in the shed pulses again—stronger. The iron braid on the nearest path-lantern (third on the left past the rosemary offerings) answers with a faint, tight *click* from inside its housing, like a latch engaging.

The threat becomes concrete: the ward-lantern has “woken.” If anyone lunges or grabs at the bracket/sigil area, it will react—fast—like a guard-dog made of light and iron.

Inside the shed, the crouched figure flinches at that click. Their hands shake harder.

“I can tell you the line,” they whisper, voice cracking. “But you have to stop the lantern from listening.”

### Turn 80 [PLAYER]

I keep my hand on the shed door but loosen my shoulders, voice low and steady. “No one touches the lantern. No sudden moves—Lanternward, breathe with me.”

To the caretaker, barely a whisper: “You saw the chalk-salt scrawl. Don’t wipe it—just cover it. Your coat, your hand, anything dull. Slow.”

I angle my face toward the shed crack. “I can’t stop it from listening entirely, but I can keep it calm. Tell me your name—quiet—and tell me the line. If you bolt, it’ll wake fully.”  

Then, without looking at her directly, I call down-tier toward the lamp-tender. “Hands off the wick. Step back from the lantern and show me both palms.”

*Agent reasoning: The ward-lantern is primed to bite if we rush it; I need to calm the “listening” without provoking it, and I don’t trust the lamp-tender or the volunteer. I’ll use my restoration habits—soft voice, small movements—and put the caretaker between me and the sigil while I get the person inside to talk.*

### Turn 82 [PLAYER]

I don’t move my feet; I just breathe slow and even. “Nobody touches the lantern—nobody.”  

I murmur to the caretaker, “Cover the chalk-salt. Coat sleeve, palm—something dull. Easy.”  

Into the shed, soft: “Tell me your name, and the line Iris was moved to. I’ll keep the door steady.”  

Then, voice carrying down-tier without looking straight at her: “Lamp-tender—step back from the lantern and show me both hands. Now.”

*Agent reasoning: The silence feels like the Lanternward “listening” harder; I need to keep everyone calm, get the caretaker to cover the sigil without provoking it, and force the lamp-tender to reveal intent while coaxing the person in the shed to give me a name and the ledger line.*

### Turn 84 [PLAYER]

I hold the shed door exactly where it is and breathe out slow. “Stay linked. Knees soft. No one touches any lantern—hear me?”  

To the caretaker, a whisper: “Cover the chalk-salt mark with your sleeve. Don’t rub—just hide it.”  

Into the shed, gentle but firm: “Name and line—now. Help me keep it calm.”  

Down-tier, voice flat: “Lamp-tender. Both hands up where I can see them, and step away from the glass.”

*Agent reasoning: The world’s gone unnervingly blank—like the lantern just swallowed sound—so I’ll ground the group with steady instructions, keep the shed door as an anchor, and try to force a response from the lamp-tender and the person inside without escalating.*

### Turn 85 [GAME]

The linked Lanternward line steadies. You hear a few ragged breaths sync with yours; boots stop scraping gravel. No one lunges.

At your whisper, the caretaker shifts—slow, obedient. He slides his sleeve up over his knuckles and *covers* the chalk-salt scrawl without rubbing. The blue pulse in the nearby lantern doesn’t stop, but it dulls a fraction, like an eye half-lidded. He keeps his wrist there, trembling.

Inside the shed, the unseen person swallows hard. A face edges into the crack of the door: young, salt-pale, with lantern-oil on their fingertips and a smear of chalk at the corner of their mouth as if they’ve been biting it.

“L—Lio,” they say, barely a breath. “Lio Marr.”

The hooked tool clinks as it’s set down—carefully, not thrown. Still, the moment metal meets plank, the path-lantern answers with that tight internal *click* again.

And then the ward bites.

The air turns metallic-sweet, like pennies warmed in sugar. The blue lantern nearest you flares, and moth-shadow shapes spiral out of the glass in a tight helix—straight toward your hands on the shed door. They don’t touch your skin like insects; they *print* themselves.

A thin soot-mark blooms across your fingers and up your knuckles like a half-glove—dark, velvety, impossible to miss in lanternlight. Your grip leaves no new smear on the wood, but your hands are now visibly “tagged,” as if the lantern has signed you.

Down-tier, your command lands. The lamp-tender freezes mid-trim. She does step back—one pace—then raises both palms. Her hands are clean. Too clean for oil-work. She speaks without looking at you, voice mild and careful.

“Of course, Miss Ashford. Both hands.”

Behind her, farther down the path, a bell answers—distant, single-toned, not the buoy-bell’s moan but a crisp cemetery bell. It rings once, then again, as if acknowledging a report being received.

Inside the shed, Lio’s eyes go wide when they see the soot on your hands.

“I— I didn’t—” they whisper urgently. “The line— Iris—” Their gaze darts to the lantern, then back to you. “Upper tier, north seam. Line *Geth—*” The rest catches in their throat, like something presses on the word.

The threat is immediate and physical: your marked hands make you identifiable in lanternlight, and the answering bell suggests Lanternward attention is already being summoned up-tier.

### Turn 86 [PLAYER]

I swallow the spike of panic and keep my marked hands on the door anyway. “Lio—look at me. Finish it: *Geth—what?* One more breath and say it.”

Without turning, I murmur to the caretaker, “Keep that scrawl covered. Don’t flinch, no matter what it does.”

Then, to the line, steady and quiet: “We’re backing away from the lantern—together. Three steps on my count, still linked.” I glance down-tier at the lamp-tender’s reflection in the glass. “And you—stay exactly where you are. If that bell is for me, I’d like to meet it with everyone still alive.”

*Agent reasoning: The ward has marked me and the bell means attention is coming fast; I need the rest of Lio’s clue before we’re interrupted, and I don’t trust the too-clean lamp-tender. I’ll keep everyone calm, get Lio out of the shed and out of the lantern’s direct line, and quietly redirect the group away from the tier while pressing Lio to finish the name.*

### Turn 87 [GAME]

Lio’s eyes lock on yours. Their throat works once, twice—like they’re forcing air past a knot.

“Geth—” they manage, and the lantern gives a sharp *tick* in answer, as if correcting them. Lio flinches, but you don’t move your hands; the door stays steady.

“Geth…erin,” Lio finishes on a thin exhale. “Line Getherin. Upper tier, north seam. Iris was moved to—” They swallow. “—to the seam’s inside row. Not hers. Not her family.”

The moment the full word lands, the soot-mark on your hands tightens—darkening at the creases of your knuckles like ink settling into paper. It doesn’t burn, but it *pulls*, a faint tug as if something has taken hold of your signature.

The caretaker does what you told him. He keeps his sleeve over the chalk-salt scrawl, jaw clenched hard enough you can see it jump. When the lantern ticks again, he stiffens but doesn’t flinch away.

Your instruction to the linked line holds. On your count, they take three careful steps back in unison, arms still hooked. Gravel crunches; the blue flare in the nearest lantern softens from a glare to a mean, steady sputter. The moth-shadow helix loosens, no longer aimed directly at your hands—still present, but circling.

Down-tier, the lamp-tender stays exactly where she is, palms up. In the lantern’s glass you catch her reflection: her mouth curves in a small, controlled smile that doesn’t reach her eyes.

The cemetery bell rings again—closer now, not louder but *nearer*, as if the ringer is moving up-tier. Footsteps follow: two sets, measured, not running. Lanternward boots on stone edging.

A voice calls from the path bend, official and calm. “Hold position. Nobody breaks the chain.”

Another lantern is coming—its light normal-yellow at first, then briefly flickering blue at the edges as it nears the warded one.

Lio whispers fast from the shed crack, panic rising. “They’ll see your hands. They’ll say you touched it. They’ll—”

The immediate threat is clear: Lanternward responders are arriving within moments, and your soot-marked hands are visible proof they can use to accuse you of tampering with a warded lantern.

### Turn 88 [PLAYER]

I keep my hands exactly where they are and raise my voice toward the approaching boots, calm and clear. “Lanternward—Wren Ashford. The ward-lantern tagged me when the tool hit the floor; I have not touched the glass, the wick, or the scrawl. We’re holding position.”

Without looking away from the shed crack, I whisper to Lio, “Breathe. Sit back from the threshold and keep your hands visible—empty. Let them see you’re not a threat.”

Then, to the caretaker in a low murmur, “When they’re close enough to hear, tell them you covered the scrawl on my instruction—no one altered it.”

*Agent reasoning: The soot-mark makes me look guilty, but panicking will get Lio hurt. I need to control the narrative before Lanternward arrives, keep the caretaker steady, and get Lio out of immediate danger without triggering the ward.*

### Turn 90 [PLAYER]

I keep my marked hands on the shed door and call out, steady, “Lanternward—Elowen Ashford. The ward-lantern tagged me when the tool struck the floor; I have not touched glass, wick, or scrawl. We are holding position and backing away together.”  
Without breaking my stance, I whisper into the crack, “Lio, sit back from the threshold—hands open, empty, where they can see. Breathe with me.”  
To the caretaker, low: “When they’re in earshot, tell them you covered the chalk-salt on my instruction—no rubbing, no changes.”

*Agent reasoning: Lanternward are arriving and my hands are marked; I need to control the narrative before they decide I tampered, and keep Lio from panicking or hiding anything.*

### Turn 91 [GAME]

Your voice carries cleanly up the path. The two sets of Lanternward boots slow, then stop where the lanternlight can reach them without putting them in the ward’s brightest spill.

A man answers first—Lanternward coat, brass badge, lantern on a long hook held out like a cautious offering. “Heard you,” he calls. “Hands where we can see them, Ashford. Don’t step toward the blue.”

Beside him, a woman in a neat oilskin apron lifts a small slate and a stub of chalk. She doesn’t write yet; she watches your soot-marked hands with an appraiser’s stillness. “Tagged,” she repeats, flat. “That’s a claim.”

Your whisper gets through the crack. Lio obeys: you hear a quick shuffle back from the threshold, then both their hands rise into the narrow opening—palms forward, empty, fingers trembling. They match your breathing for two counts, then lose it, then find it again.

The caretaker, still linked to you by the line, does exactly what you told him. He keeps his sleeve pressed over the chalk-salt scrawl like a bandage. Sweat beads at his hairline.

When the Lanternward pair come two steps closer—close enough that you can smell lamp-oil and wet wool—the caretaker speaks, voice hoarse but steady. “On Miss Ashford’s instruction. I covered it. No rubbing. No changes.”

The woman with the slate finally marks something down. The chalk makes a small, sharp sound. “Noted.”

Then she angles her lantern-hook so its light skims the shed door and your hands. The soot-tag doesn’t smear or flake; it sits in the skin’s creases like it’s been *stamped*. Her eyes flick from your knuckles to the shed crack.

“Lio Marr,” she says, as if she’s been expecting the name. “Step out. Slowly. Keep your hands up.”

Inside, Lio’s breath catches. They don’t move yet.

Down-tier, the lamp-tender you spotted earlier lowers her palms—just a fraction—then raises them again, like she’s signaling patience. She stays put, but her head tilts as if listening for something beyond the bell and boots.

The threat is immediate and specific: Lanternward is taking control of the scene, Lio is being ordered to emerge, and your soot-mark is being treated as evidence. If Lio bolts or if anyone breaks the linked line, the ward-lantern’s blue sputter intensifies—its moth-shadow spiral tightens, ready to “snap” toward the nearest moving hands.

### Turn 92 [PLAYER]

I keep my hands where they are, voice even. “Lio—listen to me. Don’t run. Slide forward on your knees until you’re in the light, then stop. Hands up the whole time.”

I call to the woman with the slate without turning my head. “Let me speak them out. They’re responding to my voice—if you rush them, the ward snaps. I’m not moving toward the blue, and the chain stays linked.”

Then, softer into the crack, “You’re not alone, Lio. One breath—then move slow, like you’re wading.”

*Agent reasoning: Lio’s panic could trigger a bolt and set the ward off; I need to keep them calm and visible while also staking my own credibility with Lanternward. I’ll offer a controlled way for Lio to come out and ask to be the one to guide them, without stepping into the blue or breaking the chain.*

### Turn 93 [GAME]

Lio’s breathing steadies on your count—one breath, then another. You hear fabric rasp against wood. A knee touches the threshold with a soft knock.

They do exactly what you said: they slide forward on their knees into the lantern’s reach, hands lifted high the whole time. Their wrists shake hard enough their fingers flutter, but they don’t drop them. When their face clears the crack, you see salt-stiff hair plastered to their forehead and a thin line of dried blood at one nostril.

The ward-lantern reacts to your voice the way you suspected: the blue sputter sharpens when the Lanternward woman shifts her hook-lantern, then eases when you speak again. The moth-shadow spiral tightens toward Lio for a heartbeat—then loosens, circling wider, as if it’s listening for the next syllable.

The woman with the slate stops advancing. She lifts her free hand, palm out, holding her partner back. “No rush,” she says, clipped. “Ashford’s right about the snap.”

Her partner—badge and hook—keeps his lantern steady and raises his voice toward Lio. “Stop where you are. Good. Don’t stand. Don’t touch the doorframe.”

Lio stops in the light, still on their knees. They swallow and speak, voice breaking. “I didn’t— I didn’t change anything. I saw the seam lantern go blue and I— I hid.”

The caretaker’s sleeve remains pressed over the chalk-salt scrawl; his linked arm trembles with strain, but he doesn’t break contact with you.

Then the down-tier lamp-tender finally moves. Not toward you—sideways, along the lower path, keeping distance from the ward’s spill. She walks with careful, practiced steps and calls up without looking directly at the blue lantern: “Supervisor Harker. You’ll want the ledger-page too, not just the hands.”

The man with the badge glances toward her, and you catch his name in the exchange—Harker, as she said. His jaw tightens. “Stay where you are, Nessa.”

Nessa doesn’t stop. She reaches a post and unhooks a small tin rattle-lantern—an auxiliary light—and begins to climb the side steps, keeping it low.

Concrete threat: Nessa is approaching with another lantern and a “ledger-page” angle, and the ward-lantern is already showing it can snap toward the nearest moving hands if the light pattern or voices change abruptly. If Nessa brings that auxiliary light too close or if Harker decides to seize Lio, the ward may lash out at whoever moves first—most likely Lio’s raised hands or your soot-marked ones.

### Turn 94 [PLAYER]

I keep my soot-marked hands on the shed door and call to Harker, measured. “Supervisor—tell Nessa to stop on that stair. No auxiliary light in the spill until the blue settles; it’s already tracking hands.”

Without looking away from Lio, I soften my voice. “Lio, stay on your knees. Eyes on me, not the lantern. Tell them what you told me—upper tier, north seam, Line Getherin, and Iris moved to an inside row.”

Then, to the Lanternward woman with the slate, quiet but firm: “If you need a statement, take it now while I’m keeping it calm. My hands were tagged when the tool hit—no contact with glass, wick, or the mark.”

*Agent reasoning: The ward is keyed to voice and sudden light changes; Nessa’s extra lantern could trigger a snap. Wren will try to slow everyone down, protect Lio, and keep control by speaking calmly and setting boundaries with Harker and Nessa.*

### Turn 95 [GAME]

Harker snaps his head toward the side steps. “Nessa—hold. Stair. Now.”

Nessa stops mid-ascent with her auxiliary rattle-lantern hanging low at her thigh. She doesn’t argue, but her mouth presses into a thin line. The rattle-lantern’s little tin belly gives one involuntary *chink* as it settles. The ward-lantern’s blue flame tightens toward the sound like an eye narrowing—then, when nothing else moves, it relaxes back into its wider spiral.

Your calm has a measurable effect: the blue sputter steadies from a frantic stutter to a slower, breathing flicker.

Lio keeps their gaze pinned to you and doesn’t look at the lantern. Still on their knees, they speak in short, rehearsed bursts, like repeating directions they’ve walked a hundred times.

“Upper tier,” they say. “North seam. Line—Getherin. The Iris plot—someone moved it. Inside row. Not where it belongs.” Their voice cracks on *belongs*, and their hands wobble but stay up.

The woman with the slate shifts her stance so the light catches both Lio and your soot-marked hands without throwing extra glare into the blue spill. “Statement,” she agrees, brisk. She writes as she speaks, turning your words into record. “Elowen Ashford: tagged when tool struck floor. No contact with glass, wick, or scrawl.”

Harker’s hook-lantern remains extended, steady, but his attention sharpens at “Getherin.” He repeats it as if tasting whether it should exist. “Getherin,” he says. “That line’s sealed.”

He gestures two fingers—minimal movement—to his partner. “Fetch the tier map. Not the annex overlay. The public one.” It’s an order meant to sound routine.

Nessa, still frozen on the stair, calls up quietly, “Supervisor, the public map won’t show the seam breaks.”

Harker doesn’t look at her. “It will show what it’s *supposed* to show.”

Concrete threat: Harker is already steering this toward an “official” version of events. If he decides Lio’s mention of Getherin is too dangerous for the record, he may move to detain them—or compel silence—while using your soot-tag as leverage. The ward-lantern is calmer, but it’s still tracking hands and sound; any sudden grab, lunge, or dropped lantern could make it snap.

### Turn 96 [PLAYER]

I keep my hands planted and meet Harker’s lantern-lit silhouette with my voice. “Supervisor, if Getherin is sealed, then it shouldn’t be answering anyone’s mouth in your ward—yet it is. Put that in the record.”

I angle my words toward the woman with the slate. “Write it exactly: *Lio Marr stated ‘Line Getherin, upper tier north seam,’ and stated the Iris plot was moved to an inside row.* No interpretations.”

Then, careful and quiet, I add for Nessa without looking at her, “If you know the seam breaks, Nessa, say so—out loud—so it’s heard by more than one person.”

*Agent reasoning: Harker’s trying to bury what Lio said; if I let him control the record, Lio gets blamed and I become leverage. I need to anchor the truth into the Lanternward’s own notes while keeping everyone slow so the ward doesn’t snap, and I want Nessa on my side without openly challenging Harker too hard.*

### Turn 97 [GAME]

Harker doesn’t answer you at first. His lantern-hook dips a fraction—enough to change the angle of light across your soot-marked fingers. The blue flame in the ward-lantern reacts to the shift: it tightens its spiral toward your knuckles, hovering there like a held breath.

The woman with the slate does what you asked. She speaks as she writes, making it audible. “Recorded verbatim: ‘Lio Marr stated, Line Getherin, upper tier north seam,’ and ‘stated the Iris plot was moved to an inside row.’” She underlines *verbatim* with a hard chalk stroke, then pauses, eyes on Harker as if daring him to contradict the page.

Harker’s jaw works. “That line doesn’t ‘answer mouths,’ Ashford,” he says, controlled. “People repeat what they hear.”

Then you press Nessa.

Nessa inhales on the stair. For a moment she looks like she might swallow it back. Instead, she lifts her chin and speaks clearly, projecting up the steps so it carries to all of you.

“I know the seam breaks,” she says. “North seam’s been opening and closing since the first blue-guttering. A hairline shift—enough to move a plot border without cracking the capstones. And the public map won’t show it.”

Harker turns his head sharply toward her. “Nessa.”

She doesn’t stop. “And the Iris plot marker was handled. Fresh tool face. Not weather.”

At the word *tool*, the caretaker flinches—his sleeve presses harder over the chalk-salt scrawl, and his elbow slides just a hair.

That tiny movement is enough.

The ward-lantern snaps.

The blue spiral lashes out in a thin, fast ribbon of light toward the nearest moving hand—the caretaker’s covered forearm—striking like a whip. There’s a sharp *sizzle* and the smell of scorched salt and singed wool. The caretaker jerks, choking on a cry, and his sleeve smokes where the ribbon hit.

His pain reflex yanks his arm—still linked to yours—down and away.

Your linked grip breaks.

The moment contact is lost, the chalk-salt beneath his sleeve flares through the fabric in a bright, cold glow, as if the mark has been waiting for air. The shed door shudders once from the inside, not from Lio—something deeper, like a latch answering a different hand.

Immediate threat: the ward-lantern is now “awake” and reactive, having successfully struck once. The chalk-salt mark has ignited under the caretaker’s sleeve, and the shed door just moved as if something inside responded to the flare.

### Turn 98 [PLAYER]

“Don’t move!” I bark, sharper than I mean to—then drop my tone. “Everyone—freeze. No extra light, no grabbing.”

I edge my soot-marked hands an inch off the door, palms open and visible, and speak steadily to the caretaker. “Look at me. Slow breaths. I’m going to take your sleeve away from the mark—slow—and you’re going to let it happen.”

To Harker, clipped: “Supervisor, order him to hold still and give me one clean cloth—now. If that scrawl’s flaring, it’s answering heat and air.”

Without stepping into the blue, I reach with two fingers only—careful, minimal motion—to pinch the edge of the caretaker’s smoking sleeve and peel it back a fraction at a time, trying to expose the chalk-salt without scraping it. “Lio,” I add without looking, “stay exactly where you are. Don’t touch the frame.”

*Agent reasoning: The lantern’s awake and the scrawl is flaring—panic will get someone burned. I need to get the caretaker’s sleeve off the mark without jerking, re-link the chain if possible, and keep Lio still while I force Harker to order everyone to freeze.*

### Turn 99 [GAME]

Your first bark lands like a slap. Everyone actually freezes—because they’ve just watched the lantern strike.

The ward-lantern’s blue ribbon quivers in the air for a beat, searching for the next motion. When you lower your tone and slow your hands, it doesn’t lash again; instead it tightens into a tense, watching coil pointed at the caretaker’s forearm.

The caretaker—young, freckled under soot—locks watery eyes on you and forces his breath to match yours. He’s shaking so hard his teeth click once.

Harker reacts to your order with a hard look, then chooses control over pride. “Jory—hold!” he snaps at the caretaker. To his partner: “Cloth. From the kit. White.”

The Lanternward woman with the slate tucks it under her arm, crouches without suddenness, and pulls a folded linen from a satchel at her hip—clean, pressed, official. She doesn’t throw it. She slides it across the gravel toward you with two fingers so it doesn’t *skitter*.

As you lift your soot-marked hands an inch off the shed door, the door gives a faint answering tremor—like a throat clearing behind wood. The latch does not open, but the seam darkens as if something inside pressed close and then eased away.

You pinch the edge of Jory’s smoking sleeve with two fingers and begin to peel.

The cloth resists at first, singed fibers sticking to whatever’s underneath. You go fraction by fraction. The ward-lantern tracks those two fingers with predatory attention, but it holds—no strike—so long as your motion stays slow and your voice stays even.

When the sleeve finally lifts enough to expose the chalk-salt, you see it clearly:

A scrawl of pale crystals and chalk, threaded with something wet-black, drawn in a looping shorthand that looks uncomfortably like old funeral-home notation—three looping letters repeated and crossed through. The exposed portion flares brighter the moment it hits open air, the glow crawling outward along the lines like frost spreading on glass.

Jory whimpers and tries to pull away on instinct.

Harker barks, “Hold, Jory!”

Jory clamps down, knuckles white, trembling in place.

Lio stays on their knees, hands still up, eyes fixed on you. They don’t touch the frame. They whisper, barely audible, “It’s the same hand.”

Concrete, immediate threat: the mark is actively “feeding” on air exposure—its glow intensifies as you uncover it—and the shed door has already responded once. If the glow reaches the edge of the sleeve line or touches bare skin, it may burn deeper or trigger another door movement; if Jory jerks suddenly, the ward-lantern is poised to strike moving hands again.

### Turn 100 [PLAYER]

I slide the clean linen over the exposed scrawl like I’m laying gauze on fresh paint—no pressure, no rubbing—just sealing it from air. “Jory, keep breathing; don’t yank. Let the cloth do the work.”

Without looking up, I say to the Lanternward woman, “Write that too: *Lio Marr said, ‘It’s the same hand.’*” Then to Harker, tight: “That shorthand—do you recognize it, or are we all going to pretend funeral notation isn’t in your ward?”

I keep my voice low and steady toward the shed seam. “Whatever’s listening in there—no. Stay.”

*Agent reasoning: The mark is flaring with air, so I need to smother it fast without scraping; Jory’s panic and the ward-lantern’s hair-trigger mean I have to keep everyone slow and anchored, and Lio’s “same hand” feels like a vital clue to get on record immediately.*

### Turn 101 [GAME]

The linen settles over the glowing scrawl with almost no sound.

The effect is immediate and visible: the chalk-salt flare dims from a hard, icy white to a muted, milk-glow that no longer crawls outward. The singed smell lessens. Jory’s trembling doesn’t stop, but the panic in it eases into something he can hold.

“Good,” Harker says under his breath—more to the situation than to you. He keeps his hook-lantern fixed, but he angles it slightly away from Jory’s forearm, reducing the blue’s direct attention.

Jory swallows and nods once, fast. “I’m—holding,” he manages, voice thin.

The Lanternward woman with the slate speaks as she writes again, crisp and audible. “Recorded: ‘Lio Marr said, It’s the same hand.’” Her chalk pauses at the end of the sentence, then continues—she’s adding more than you asked, the scratch of it quickening as if she doesn’t want to forget what she saw.

At your question about shorthand, Harker’s posture tightens. He doesn’t answer right away.

Then: “I recognize *funeral notation*,” he says carefully, each word measured. “I don’t recognize it belonging here.”

It’s not denial. It’s a boundary being drawn.

Behind the linen, the mark gives one last faint pulse—like a heartbeat muffled under cloth—and then holds steady.

Your quiet warning toward the shed seam is met with a physical response: the door stops shuddering, but the latch gives a small, deliberate *tick* from the inside, as if something tested it and decided against. A thin line of colder air slips out through the seam and brushes your fingers—brine-cold, with the metallic tang of buoy-bells.

Lio’s eyes flick to the seam despite themselves. Their hands stay up. “It hears voices,” they whisper. “Not names. Voices.”

Nessa, still on the stair, doesn’t move, but she watches Harker now instead of the lantern. “Supervisor,” she says, low, “that cloth won’t hold if he sweats through it.”

Concrete threat: the scrawl is contained but not neutralized—if the linen shifts, gets damp, or is pulled off, it may flare again and provoke the ward-lantern or the shed latch. The shed is still “responsive”; it has tested the latch from inside and vented cold air, suggesting something within is awake and listening for cues.

### Turn 102 [PLAYER]

I keep one hand hovering near the linen, the other open at my side. “Nessa’s right—Jory, you’re going to overheat. Harker, have someone bring a dry second layer—waxed oilcloth if you’ve got it—and a length of twine. We bind the linen *lightly* so it can’t slip, and we keep him cool.”

I speak toward Lio without turning my head. “Lio, keep your eyes on me and tell me—what voice did it answer first? Mine, or yours?”

Then, still low, I add for the slate-woman to catch: “And write this: the latch ticked from inside when the mark pulsed.”

*Agent reasoning: The scrawl is calmer under linen but could flare if it gets damp; we need a better seal without provoking the ward or the shed. I also don’t trust Harker’s “boundary,” so I want Nessa on record and Lio kept safe while I stabilize Jory and reduce variables (heat, sweat, extra light).*

### Turn 103 [GAME]

Harker doesn’t argue. He points without looking away from Jory’s arm. “Tamsin—oilcloth. Twine. Now. And don’t run.”

A second Lanternward caretaker—Tamsin, older, hair pinned under a cap—backs away from the circle and heads down the path at a fast walk, lantern held low to keep its light from flaring.

Jory nods too quickly. Sweat already beads at his temple. He keeps his forearm held out like it’s someone else’s.

The slate-woman writes as you speak. “Noted: ‘Latch ticked from inside when the mark pulsed.’” Then she adds, almost reluctantly, “Observed: cold air exhaled from seam.” She says *observed* like a shield.

You keep your hand hovering near the linen. The cloth stays in place; the glow beneath remains muted. No new lash from the ward-lantern—its blue coil stays taut, aimed, but still.

Your question to Lio cuts through the hush.

Lio’s eyes stay on you as instructed. Their throat works once. “Yours,” they answer. “It… leaned toward you when you spoke like you meant it. When I talked, it listened—when you talked, it *moved*.”

Harker’s gaze flicks to you at that, sharp and assessing, then back to the covered mark. “So it’s keyed to authority,” he mutters, half to himself.

The shed responds to the conversation in a way you can’t mistake: a slow pressure against the door from the inside—just enough to bow the wood a fraction at the seam—then release. Dust puffs from the hinge line. The latch does not open, but the *tick* repeats, closer in time to your voice than before.

Immediate, concrete threat: the shed is actively reacting to speech cadence and “command” tone; each time it tests the latch, the door flexes and sheds dust. If it finds the right cue—or if the mark is uncovered again—it may open, or something inside may force the seam. Also, Jory is starting to sweat; if moisture seeps into the linen, the containment may fail.

Tamsin has not returned yet. You have a brief window where the mark is stable but vulnerable.

### Turn 104 [PLAYER]

I lower my voice to something almost conversational and stop addressing the shed entirely. “Harker—no more orders near the door. If it’s keyed to authority, you and I are ringing the bell for it.”

I glance at Jory’s face, not his arm. “Jory, sit—slowly—back against the wall. Keep your forearm lifted and still; I’ll keep the cloth sealed.” With my free hand I tug my own outer sleeve/kerchief loose and fan once, gently, to move air across his neck and temples—away from the linen.

To Lio, soft: “Good. Thank you. Don’t speak to it—just breathe with me.”

*Agent reasoning: The shed is reacting to my “authority” tone, so I need to stop feeding it cues while keeping Jory safe and the mark sealed; I’ll switch to softer speech, reduce movement, and physically cool Jory without disturbing the linen, while asking Harker to take over any commands.*

### Turn 105 [GAME]

Harker takes your point with a visible effort. He clamps his mouth shut, then gestures instead—two fingers down, palm flat—signaling *quiet* to the others without speaking. Even the slate-woman’s chalk slows to shorter strokes.

The shed responds to the change like an animal deprived of a cue. The seam stops bowing. The latch does not tick again. For the first time since the strike, the door is simply a door—closed, tense, but not actively testing itself.

Jory follows your instruction. He lowers himself in a controlled slide until his back meets the shed’s outer wall, boots braced. He keeps his forearm lifted, elbow bent, the linen-covered mark held away from his body. His breathing is ragged at first, then begins to find your pace.

When you fan air across his neck and temples—careful to angle it away from the linen—his skin cools. The sweat at his hairline beads but doesn’t run down toward his arm. The linen stays dry. The muted glow under it remains steady.

Lio mirrors you: a slow inhale, a slow exhale. Their shoulders drop a fraction. They do not speak again.

Nessa moves without being told. She crouches on Jory’s other side and produces a small tin from her apron—lanolin salve, the kind used for chapped hands—then stops, looking to you for a cue before she dares bring anything near the cloth.

Harker watches the shed, then you. When he finally speaks, it’s a whisper aimed away from the door, as if he’s trying not to “ring the bell.”

“Fine,” he says. “No orders.”

Down the path, Tamsin returns at a brisk walk, not running. She carries a folded square of waxed oilcloth and a coil of thin twine held in her fist. She slows as she nears, reading the stillness, and stops just outside the lantern’s blue reach.

Concrete threat status: your de-escalation works—speech near the door clearly reduces the shed’s latch activity—but the ward-lantern remains coiled and reactive to sudden movement, and the mark is still only contained by a dry barrier. If the cloth shifts or gets damp, the glow may flare and trigger another strike or renewed door response.

### Turn 106 [PLAYER]

I give Tamsin a small beckoning motion, palm down, and whisper, “Slow—set them on the ground within my reach.”  

To Nessa, I nod once toward the tin, then murmur, “Not on the cloth. Just his neck—lightly—keep him cool.”  

Keeping my eyes on Jory’s face, I slide the waxed oilcloth over the linen like a second skin, then loop the twine around his forearm twice and tie it with a loose bow-knot. “Jory, tell me the second you feel heat under there—don’t be brave.”

*Agent reasoning: The shed reacts to “authority” tone, so I’ll keep voices minimal and calm. The priority is stabilizing the linen with oilcloth and twine without triggering the ward-lantern or sweating through the barrier; I’ll use small, deliberate motions and enlist Nessa/Tamsin with silent cues.*

### Turn 108 [PLAYER]

I beckon Tamsin in with a palm-down “easy,” whispering, “Set the oilcloth and twine on the ground—right there—then back away.” I nod to Nessa. “Salve on his neck only, nothing near the wrap.”  

I layer the waxed oilcloth over the linen without pressing, then loop the twine twice and tie a loose bow. “Jory—look at me. If you feel heat, tug my sleeve once. Don’t try to endure it.”

*Agent reasoning: We need to secure the covering without provoking the lantern or the shed; keep Jory calm and cool, and get everyone quieter and farther from the door.*

I lift my hand, palm-down, to Tamsin. “Easy—set the oilcloth and twine on the ground within my reach, then step back.”  
I nod once to Nessa. “Salve on his neck only—nothing near the wrap.”  
Keeping my eyes on Jory’s face, I slide the waxed oilcloth over the linen and tie the twine in a loose bow. “Jory—look at me. If you feel heat, tug my sleeve once. Don’t try to endure it.”

*Agent reasoning: The shed calmed when we stopped issuing commands; I need to secure the mark without provoking the lantern or the door, and set a simple signal with Jory so he doesn’t panic or “tough it out.”*

### Turn 112 [PLAYER]

I raise a palm-down hand to Tamsin. “Easy—set the oilcloth and twine on the ground within my reach, then step back.”  
I tip my chin to Nessa. “Salve on his neck only—nothing near the wrap.”  
Without looking at the shed, I slide the waxed oilcloth over the linen and tie the twine in a loose bow. “Jory—look at me. If you feel heat, tug my sleeve once. Don’t try to endure it.”

*Agent reasoning: The shed calmed when we stopped “commanding” it; I need to reinforce the wrap without provoking another latch-test, and keep Jory from overheating. Quiet gestures and steady reassurance feel safest—and very Wren.*

### Turn 113 [GAME]

Tamsin swallows, then does exactly as told—she crouches just long enough to set the folded oilcloth and a coil of twine on the packed earth by your knee, then retreats two steps, hands lifted like she’s afraid of brushing the wrong air.

Nessa’s fingers are already slick with a sharp-smelling salve. She keeps it to Jory’s neck and collarbone, careful, almost clinical—no touch to the linen wrap. “I’m not stupid,” she mutters, but her voice shakes. The salve leaves a faint sheen on his skin and the tight tendons at his throat ease a fraction.

You slide the waxed oilcloth over the linen without pressing. The cloth catches briefly on a frayed edge, then settles, dull and waterproof. When you loop the twine and tie the loose bow, the knot holds without biting down.

Jory forces his eyes to yours. His breathing is shallow; the whites of his eyes show. He gives a small, jerky nod—he understands.

Then the lanternlight in the room (thin, yellow) flickers—once, twice—and for half a second it gutters an unnatural blue.

Jory flinches hard. His fingers claw at your sleeve and tug once—exactly as instructed. Heat blooms under your palm where the oilcloth hovers: not a burn yet, but a sudden, feverish radiance seeping through the linen like a kettle coming to boil. The air near the wrap takes on a briny-metal smell, like wet pennies and seaweed.

From outside, beyond the shed wall, there’s a soft scrape: wood against wood, slow and deliberate—someone shifting their weight near the door, trying not to be heard.

Nessa freezes with her salve-smeared hand suspended midair. Tamsin’s eyes snap to the door; she backs another step, heel bumping a crate.

Jory keeps hold of your sleeve, knuckles whitening, waiting for what you do next.

### Turn 114 [PLAYER]

I cover Jory’s hand with mine, steadying his grip. “I’ve got you—good. Keep breathing with me.”  

Without raising my voice, I glance at Nessa and make a small slicing gesture across my throat—*silence*—then point down toward the floor by Jory’s hip, indicating she should set the tin down and keep her hands away from the wrap.  

I lean my mouth close to Jory’s ear. “Cold air only—no water. Can you shift your elbow a finger-width higher?”  

Then, still not looking at the door, I whisper to Harker, “Someone’s out there. No titles, no commands—just… be ready to catch, not strike.”

*Agent reasoning: Jory’s warning means the mark is flaring; I need to cool and stabilize it without moisture near the wrap, and I can’t provoke whatever’s at the door with authority-talk. I’ll keep everyone quiet, ground Jory, and quietly prepare to confront the presence without escalating.*

### Turn 115 [GAME]

Jory’s grip stops scrabbling and becomes purposeful under your hand—still tight, but anchored. He matches your inhale on the second try, breath catching less in his throat.

Nessa sees your slicing gesture and clamps her mouth shut mid-reply. She lowers into a careful crouch and sets the salve tin on the floor by Jory’s hip with a soft metallic tick, then pulls both hands back to her own lap, palms up, as if proving she won’t touch anything. Her eyes stay fixed on the wrapped spot, wide and resentfully obedient.

At your whisper, Jory swallows. He tries to shift his elbow; the movement is tiny, controlled—about a finger-width. The linen creaks faintly beneath the oilcloth. The heat under it surges once in response, like something noticing it’s been moved, then steadies to a hot, steady pulse. The briny-metal smell sharpens and you see a thin thread of steam—or breath that isn’t yours—curl from the edge of the oilcloth and vanish.

You whisper to Harker.

A figure at the far side of the shed—half in shadow near a stack of lobster crates—straightens. Harker had been there all along, quiet as a hung coat. He doesn’t answer aloud. He shifts his weight so he’s between Jory and the door, hands open and low like you asked, knees slightly bent.

Outside, the scrape stops.

Then the door latch lifts with a slow, careful click.

The door opens the width of a hand. A sliver of colder air slides in, carrying damp salt and the faint, sweet rot of seaweed. In the gap: an eye and part of a cheek, pale in the lanternlight, watching the floor more than your faces—as if looking for where feet are placed.

Tamsin’s heel knocks the crate again, louder this time. The watcher outside freezes. The door doesn’t close, but it stops moving.

Jory tugs your sleeve a second time—shorter, urgent. The heat under the oilcloth spikes in a single beat, enough that the waxed surface looks briefly slicker, as if sweating.

### Turn 116 [PLAYER]

I keep my palm hovering over the oilcloth without pressing and squeeze Jory’s hand once. “I felt it—don’t move. Breathe with me, in… out.”

Without looking at the gap, I speak to the door in a calm, low voice. “If you’re here to help, come in slow with your hands empty. If you’re here to take him, you’ll have to look me in the face while you do it.”

I flick two fingers toward Tamsin—*bolt it*—then murmur to Nessa, “Slide the tin farther away with your foot. No sudden reaches.”

*Agent reasoning: Jory’s heat is escalating and the door watcher could panic; I need to de-escalate with words while keeping the wrap stable and preventing anyone from touching it.*

### Turn 117 [GAME]

Your squeeze lands; Jory holds still. He drags his breath into sync with yours—ragged, but it happens. The heat under the oilcloth stays high and prickly, like a stove left too near boil, but it doesn’t spike again while he’s motionless.

At your voice to the door, the eye in the gap shifts—finally looking up. The cheek tightens as if the person is baring teeth behind closed lips.

A low answer comes through the crack, muffled and careful. “Help’s expensive, Wren Ashford.”

They know your name.

Tamsin reacts to your two-finger flick immediately. She steps in, fast but quiet, and reaches for the bolt—

—but the door nudges inward another inch at the same moment, as if the person outside is leaning weight against it. The bolt scrapes metal-on-metal and doesn’t seat. Tamsin’s face pinches with panic; she tries again, harder, and the wood shivers.

Nessa, obeying you, uses the inside edge of her boot to slide the salve tin away. It skitters across the floorboards with a soft rasp and stops under a bench.

Outside, a second sound joins the first: a wet, dragging step in the mud just beyond the threshold, not matched to the voice. Something else is there—close, low to the ground, moving like it’s heavy or hurt.

The crack widens enough to show fingers—empty hands, yes, but stained dark at the tips as if inked or brined. The person doesn’t come in. They angle their head, listening, and their gaze drops straight to Jory’s wrapped arm as if it’s a beacon.

Jory’s fingers clamp around yours again. He doesn’t tug—he just grips, pleading without moving.

Harker shifts one silent step nearer the door, hands still open, ready to catch—his shoulders squared to block a rush.

The threat is immediate and specific now: someone at the door knows who you are, is trying to force the door wider with their body weight, and something wet and dragging is positioned just outside, ready to follow if the gap opens.

### Turn 118 [PLAYER]

I keep my hand over the oilcloth and meet Jory’s grip. “Stay with me. Don’t move—good.”

To the crack in the door, steady and cold: “Don’t use my name like we’re friends. Tell me yours, and tell me what that thing is at your feet.”

I nod sharply at Harker and jerk my chin toward the doorframe—brace it—then murmur to Tamsin, “Get your shoulder into it, low. Not the bolt.”

*Agent reasoning: They know my name and they’re pushing—talking buys seconds, but we need the door held and Jory kept still. I’m not going to escalate with violence; I’ll try to anchor the intruder with specifics while shifting bodies to brace the door and keep the wrap cold and undisturbed.*

### Turn 119 [GAME]

Jory stays still. His grip on you is painful but controlled, like he’s using your hand as an anchor to keep his body from flinching. The oilcloth under your hovering palm continues to radiate that hard, kettle-heat; you can feel it even without touching.

At the door, there’s a pause—an inhale you can hear through the crack.

Then the voice answers, closer now, as if they’ve leaned their mouth to the gap. “Merrick,” they say. “And that’s not a *thing*. That’s a debt I dragged in so it wouldn’t find you first.”

As Merrick speaks, the wet dragging sound shifts. Something presses into the threshold from the outside, low and unseen—followed by a soft, sucking scrape like kelp pulled off stone. The smell of seaweed rot strengthens sharply.

Harker moves when you signal. He plants his shoulder and forearm against the doorframe from inside, bracing the jamb rather than the door itself, feet spread for leverage. He keeps his hands open as promised, but his stance is now a physical barrier.

Tamsin drops her weight low and drives her shoulder into the door near the latch instead of fumbling the bolt. The door gives a protesting groan and swings a hair wider under the outside pressure—then stops as Harker’s brace catches the frame. The gap holds at only a few inches, but it’s enough for you to see more.

In the sliver: Merrick’s face—young enough to still have softness at the mouth, old enough to have learned not to show it. Sea-mist beads in his lashes. His fingertips are stained a dark, briny black like old ink. He keeps his hands visible, empty, but he’s leaning his hip into the door as leverage.

And at his feet, half in the gap now, is what made the dragging sound: a sodden bundle of netting and kelp tied around something that moves in small, wrong pulses. A human forearm—bloated and pale—protrudes from the net, the skin stippled as if pickled. The hand at the end twitches, not like a living person waking, but like a reflex tugged by a current.

Merrick’s eyes flick from the bundled arm to you. “If you open this,” he says quietly, “it comes in. If you don’t… it keeps knocking until it learns the shape of your door.”

Jory squeezes your hand once, hard—still not moving his arm—his breath turning thin with fear at the sight in the gap.

### Turn 120 [PLAYER]

I swallow hard and keep my hand hovering over the oilcloth, eyes locked on Jory for a beat. “You’re doing it. Breathe—stay still. I won’t let it touch you.”  

Then I lift my gaze to the crack, voice low and razor-flat. “Merrick—back that bundle away from my threshold. If it ‘learns,’ it learns from *contact*. Don’t give it the door.”  

I tilt my head toward the yard, not the room. “Tell me what it wants, and what you did to make it follow. Then—slow—slide a clean rope in with your foot and I’ll loop it around the net from here. You keep your hands empty, and you do not step inside.”

*Agent reasoning: Merrick knows my name and brought something dangerous; I need information fast and to keep Jory stable, but I can’t let that bundle inside. I’ll hold the line at the door and try to negotiate a controlled handoff outside while keeping everyone calm.*

### Turn 121 [GAME]

Jory’s eyes flutter shut at your promise. He follows your count—inhale, exhale—jaw clenched so hard you hear his molars click. He does not move the wrapped arm. The heat under the oilcloth stays steady, a punishing, contained burn.

At the door, Merrick hesitates—then does what you told him.

He shifts his hip off the door and drags the kelp-net bundle backward with the side of his boot. It resists like it’s snagged on the sill. For one second the pale hand in the net curls, fingers scraping the threshold wood—contact, brief and ugly.

The bundle jerks as if yanked by an invisible tide. It thumps back into the mud outside with a wet slap.

The immediate consequence: the door pressure eases. Harker’s brace suddenly has nothing to fight and he stumbles half a step, catching himself against the frame. The gap narrows a fraction as the door swings back toward closed under its own weight, leaving only Merrick’s face and shoulder visible.

Merrick keeps his hands up, empty. His voice drops. “It wants what was taken off it. A name. A right burial. A place in the book.” His eyes flick, involuntarily, toward the cemetery hill beyond the yard as if he can see it through the boards. “I didn’t *make* it follow. I opened something I shouldn’t—down by the tide steps. I thought it was a Choir-marked cache. It wasn’t. It was… a return.”

The kelp bundle outside shifts again, dragging a shallow groove in the mud toward the door on its own, slow but determined—like a hooked fish being reeled with no line in sight. The pale hand bumps the bottom of the door once. A soft knock. Then another, slightly higher.

Merrick swears under his breath. He looks at your feet, not your face, and does exactly as instructed: he hooks his heel behind something outside and nudges a length of rope forward. A clean, pale line slides into the shed across the threshold, inch by inch. No hands. The rope is damp but not slimy—fresh hemp, not net.

Tamsin shifts to block the rope with her boot so it doesn’t snake too far in. Nessa stays frozen, eyes fixed on the moving bundle outside like she’s watching a drowned body try to sit up.

Threat, clear and present: the kelp-net “debt” is still trying to make contact with the door and is moving on its own toward the threshold again, despite Merrick backing it away. The rope is now within your reach, but the gap is still open a few inches and the thing is actively knocking upward, learning.

### Turn 122 [PLAYER]

I hook the rope with two fingers and, without lifting my hand off Jory’s, nudge it toward Harker with my foot. “Loop it low around the net—don’t let it touch the sill again. Then pull it back into the yard, away from the door.”

I look at Tamsin. “On my count, shove the door shut—hard—and drop the bar. One… two… now.”

To Merrick through the narrowing crack: “If it wants the book, it comes to *me*—not him. Tide steps. Choir-marked. Tell me exactly what you opened, and what name you stole, and I’ll see if I can give it a resting place.”

*Agent reasoning: Jory’s heating up and the door-thing is learning by touch; I need to shut the gap and control the bundle from inside without letting it cross. The rope is our only safe reach tool, and Merrick’s “book” comment points to cemetery records—my turf.*

### Turn 124 [PLAYER]

I keep Jory’s hand pinned gently and kick the rope toward Harker. “Low loop—around the net. Pull it back into the yard, away from the sill.”  

“Tamsin—now,” I snap, then brace my own shoulder into the door edge as she slams it shut and drops the bar.  

Through the last crack, I call to Merrick, voice tight: “Tide steps—what did you open, and what name did you take? Say it plain, or you can keep your debt.”

*Agent reasoning: The gap is still open and the debt-thing is learning the door; my priority is to get it away from the threshold and shut us in, while pressing Merrick for specifics before he bolts.*

### Turn 126 [PLAYER]

I shove the rope toward Harker with my boot. “Low loop, quick—then drag it back into the yard, far from the sill.”

I slam my shoulder into the door with Tamsin. “Now—HARD. Bar it!”

Once the bar drops, I lean close to the seam and speak through the wood, controlled but shaking. “Merrick—tell me what you opened at the tide steps and the name you took. Say it plain, and I’ll try to give it a place that isn’t Jory.”

*Agent reasoning: The door’s becoming the battleground; I need it shut and Jory protected, but I also need Merrick to give me the exact details before he bolts. I’ll commit to closing the door, then try to get the name through the wood.*

### Turn 128 [PLAYER]

I keep my hand over the oilcloth and squeeze Jory’s fingers once. “You’re safe—look at me. Can you feel your toes? Tell me if anything’s numb.”  
I glance to Harker and Tamsin. “Don’t unbar it for anything—wedge the frame if you can.”  
Then I press my mouth close to the seam of the door. “Merrick. I’m listening through the wood. Tide steps—what did you open, and what name did you take? Start talking.”

*Agent reasoning: The silence feels like the door finally shut—good. But we’re blind now, and that “debt” is still out there. I need everyone steady, check Jory, then get Merrick to talk through the door without reopening it.*

### Turn 129 [GAME]

Jory’s fingers twitch inside yours—cold, but present. His eyes find your face and stick there like he’s using it as a nail to hang himself on.

“I—” he wets his lips, then swallows hard. “Toes… yes. Both. But my left foot feels… thick. Like it’s wrapped.”

You slide your hand a fraction on the oilcloth. Beneath it, the bundled shape at his shin gives a faint, wrong little pulse—too slow to be blood, too deliberate to be muscle. Jory flinches when it does, jaw clenched so tight his molars show.

Harker doesn’t argue. He drops to a knee by the door, shoves a broken plank and a wedge of stone into the bottom corner, then drives it home with the heel of his hand. The frame complains with a dry crackle. Tamsin drags a salt-sack from the wall and rams it against the latch side, bracing her shoulder into it like she expects the whole world to lean back.

“Not opening,” she says, breath sharp. “Not for prayers, not for mothers.”

You press your mouth to the seam.

For a moment there’s only the surf’s distant heave and the buoy-bell’s moan—then something scrapes the outside of the door, slow and careful, like a fingernail testing grain.

Merrick’s voice comes through the wood, close enough you can hear his teeth click when he speaks.

“I opened the second step,” he says, each word measured like he’s paying for them. “The one with the old nail in it. I shouldn’t’ve—Lanternward said it was sealed, but—”

He breaks off. Something wet taps the door twice from the outside. Not a knock. A drip.

“I took a name,” Merrick goes on, hoarse now. “Not mine. I thought it was just a *word* you carry to keep the sea from choosing you. That’s what the Choir said. ‘Borrow it till the next moon.’”

He draws a breath that shudders.

“It was your mother’s shorthand on the stone. Three loops. I— I said it out loud.”

Outside, right against the seam, a thin sound like thread being drawn tight.

“And it answered,” Merrick whispers. “It answered with *Jory*.”

### Turn 130 [PLAYER]

My stomach drops at the mention of my mother, but I keep my palm firm over the oilcloth and meet Jory’s eyes. “Don’t listen to names, alright? Just my voice. Wiggle your toes again—both—and tell me if the thick feeling climbs.”

I press my forehead to the door seam, voice low. “Merrick, stop saying his name. Describe the mark—three loops where, on what stone, facing which way—and what exactly you *said* when you opened the second step. Word for word.”

Without looking away from Jory, I murmur to Harker and Tamsin, “Salt line the threshold inside. If it tests the seam again, we don’t answer. No more names in this room.”

*Agent reasoning: Merrick invoking my mother’s mark and Jory’s name makes this personal and dangerous; I need to keep Jory grounded, stop further “learning” through names, and get precise details about the mark without letting panic take the room.*

### Turn 131 [GAME]

Jory swallows and does what you ask like it’s a rope you’ve thrown him.

“Right… your voice.” He wiggles both feet. The right responds cleanly. The left lags—then obeys, small and stubborn. His brows knit. “It’s… higher. Not to my knee. Just… ankle to calf. Like wet sand in a stocking.”

Under the oilcloth, that wrong pulse at his shin answers with a slow thump-thump, as if whatever’s wrapped there heard it had been noticed.

At the door, you feel the seam vibrate faintly when Merrick shifts his weight on the other side. He takes your warning; when he speaks again, he avoids the name like it’s a hook.

“The mark—three loops—was on a small slate,” he says, voice tight. “Not a headstone. A boundary slate. Half-buried at the tide steps’ top landing, left side as you face down to the water. Loops cut shallow, like someone didn’t want it seen unless you knew to look.”

A pause. A swallow. Then, word for word, he recites, and you can hear his shame in the precision:

“*By lantern-law and brine-breath, I unstep what was stepped. I take what was taken. I carry it till called.*”

As he finishes, something outside drags along the door’s lower edge—metal on wood—searching. The bar shivers once, hard enough to make Tamsin grunt and brace more of her weight into the salt-sack.

Harker crouches and pours a thin white line of salt along the inside threshold, careful not to break it. When he reaches the hinge side, his hand hesitates.

There, just under the lowest hinge, the rust-bloom isn’t random: a brine-bell motif scratched into the metal, neat as a signature. Beside it, three pinprick holes in a tight triangle—placed to whistle when the wind hits.

Harker’s eyes flick to yours. “Wren,” he says softly, “this door’s been used to signal.”

Outside, close to the seam, the thread-tightening sound comes again—followed by a faint, eager inhale that isn’t Merrick’s.

Then a voice that *tries* to be Merrick’s speaks through the wood, too smooth, wrong at the edges:

“Open. I said it plain.”

The salt line holds unbroken, but the doorframe creaks as if something is settling its weight to test it.

### Turn 132 [PLAYER]

I tighten my hand over the oilcloth and lean close to Jory’s ear. “Good. Keep moving those toes—slow, steady. If it creeps higher, squeeze my fingers twice.”

I look at Harker and point at the brine-bell scratch. “Jam those whistle-holes—wax, cloth, anything. No more signaling.” Then to Tamsin, quiet but sharp: “No talking back. Not even ‘no.’”

I press my lips to the seam without raising my voice. “You’re not Merrick. You can’t have what’s under my hand—this threshold is salted, this door is barred, and you’re not invited.”

*Agent reasoning: The thing is mimicking Merrick to bait us into opening; I need to keep everyone quiet, reinforce the ward, and use what Merrick said plus the door’s signal mark to buy time and redirect attention away from Jory—without speaking names.*

### Turn 133 [GAME]

Jory nods against your shoulder and keeps his feet moving—small flexes, steady like counting beads. His grip tightens once, then relaxes, following your rhythm. The thick feeling doesn’t jump higher immediately, but the oilcloth shifts with another deliberate thump at his shin, as if something beneath it is pressing to learn the shape of your hand.

Harker moves fast. He pulls a stub of candle from his pocket—half-used, soft from being carried—scrapes wax with his thumbnail, and kneads it into the three pinprick holes by the hinge. He packs them until the triangle is a dull, sealed smear. Then he takes a strip of cloth from his sleeve cuff and ties it tight over the brine-bell scratch like a blindfold.

“No more singing door,” he mutters.

Tamsin clamps her mouth shut so hard her jaw trembles. She doesn’t even breathe through her lips.

At the seam, you speak—carefully, without giving it anything to catch on.

For two heartbeats, there’s nothing.

Then the thing outside shifts its weight. The door bows inward a fraction; the bar groans; the wedge Harker set bites deeper with a gritty crunch. The salt line along the threshold doesn’t scatter, but it *fizzes* in three places, tiny wet pops like fat in a pan.

A sound follows—thread drawn through cloth, faster now, impatient.

Merrick’s real voice breaks through from farther back, muffled and panicked, as if he’s been dragged away from the door or is crouched down on the steps.

“It’s not me— I’m not at the seam—don’t—”

His words cut off with a sharp, involuntary gasp.

The voice at the door answers you again, still wearing Merrick’s tone like a borrowed coat, but now it’s angry enough to show seams:

“Not invited,” it repeats, savoring the phrase. “That’s a *rule.* Rules can be… amended.”

Something hard scrapes along the outside of the threshold—stone or metal—etching. The door shudders in short, testing jolts, not a full ram: it’s feeling for weakness, for a place the salt line is thin.

Under your hand, Jory suddenly squeezes your fingers twice—tight, tight—then points weakly at his own calf with his free hand, eyes wide. The “wet sand” sensation has climbed to just below his knee.

Whatever is wrapped under the oilcloth gives one stronger pulse, and you feel it push outward, as if answering the pressure at the door.

### Turn 134 [PLAYER]

I turn away from the door and cup Jory’s face. “Eyes on me—breathe. I’m going to look, and it might be ugly, but it’s just a thing and we can treat it.”  
To Harker, urgent: “More salt—thick, right where it’s fizzing. And if you’ve got iron, put it across the sill.” To Tamsin: “Find me a knife and clean cloth—now.”  
Then I peel back the oilcloth from Jory’s shin just enough to see what’s pulsing, keeping my hand braced on his leg. “Tell me what you feel when I touch it—sharp, cold, burning?”

*Agent reasoning: Jory’s numbness is climbing fast and the thing outside is rewriting rules at the threshold; I need to stop feeding it attention, reinforce the salt, and check what’s under the oilcloth before it takes his leg.*

### Turn 136 [PLAYER]

I cup Jory’s face and force my voice steady. “Look at me. Breathe with me—slow. I’m going to check it.”  
“Harker—salt the fizzing spots thick, and if you have any iron at all, lay it across the sill. Tamsin—knife and clean cloth, now.”  
I peel the oilcloth back just enough to see Jory’s shin, keeping my palm braced on his leg. “Tell me exactly what you feel when I touch it—cold, burning, sharp?”

*Agent reasoning: Jory’s numbness is climbing and whatever’s under the oilcloth is reacting to the door; I need to assess the wound/mark before it spreads, while keeping everyone silent and reinforcing the threshold.*

### Turn 137 [GAME]

Jory locks on to your eyes like they’re a handhold. He matches your breath—ragged at first, then slower. When you say you’re going to check it, he nods once, hard.

Harker drops to his knees at the threshold. He pours a heavy ridge of salt over the three fizzing spots until it looks like spilled flour. The fizzing dulls to a damp hiss. Then he yanks a short iron nail-puller from his belt (blackened, old), and lays it flat across the sill, pinning it under the door’s inner lip as best he can without breaking the salt line.

The door answers immediately: a sharp *tap-tap-tap* from the other side, right where the iron rests, like knuckles testing a bruise. The bar flexes. The wedge squeals but holds.

Tamsin scrambles to a cupboard. You hear drawers slapped open. “I—” she starts, catches herself, and clamps down on the word. She returns with a small kitchen knife and a folded strip of linen—clean, but thin. She puts both into your free hand without speaking, eyes fixed on the oilcloth.

You peel the oilcloth back just enough.

Jory’s shin is wrapped in brine-thread—pale cord slick with saltwater sheen—stitched into his skin in looping, careful passes. It isn’t bleeding; the skin around each stitch is blanched, as if pickled. The pattern isn’t random: it traces a brine-bell shape, and at its “mouth” sits a small, dark object pressed into the flesh like a button.

When you brace your palm and touch near it, the stitches tense under your fingers as if they’re alive.

Jory sucks in air. “Cold,” he says at once—then his voice jumps. “No—cold and… *pulling.* Like it’s trying to drink the heat out of me. And sharp, right there—” He flinches and points to the dark “button.”

At the door, the false Merrick voice goes quiet.

Instead, a thin sound starts at the seam—high, papery, eager—like moth-wings worrying at cloth. The lanternlight under the door stutters blue, and the salt ridge trembles in place, grains jittering as if something is humming just beyond hearing.

Whatever is stitched into Jory’s leg gives one strong pulse—hard enough you see the brine-thread lift a fraction—answering the seam’s flutter like a call-and-response.

### Turn 138 [PLAYER]

I swallow hard and keep my voice gentle for Jory. “Alright. Cold and pulling—thank you. Keep looking at me.”  
I take a pinch of Harker’s salt and rub it firmly over the dark “button,” then press the iron nail-puller against it for a few seconds to see if the thread slackens; if it does, I slide the knife tip under one loop and cut a single stitch.  
Without turning to the door, I murmur to Harker, “If that seam starts talking again, hit it with more salt—don’t answer it, just bury the sound.”

*Agent reasoning: The stitching is actively responding to whatever’s at the door; I need to disrupt the brine-thread connection fast without making Jory panic, and I want to avoid feeding it names or voice. Salt and iron seem to repel it, so I’ll use both on the “button” and cut only if it loosens.*

### Turn 139 [GAME]

Salt grinds under your thumb as you rub it into the dark “button.” The sheen on it turns matte, like wet ink blotted with paper. Jory’s eyes squeeze shut for a beat—then he forces them open to find yours again.

You press the iron nail-puller to it.

The reaction is immediate and ugly: the brine-thread goes taut as harp wire, and the “button” gives a tiny, resisting *click* against the iron, like a tooth on glass. A cold shock runs up into your palm—numbing, not pain exactly, but a fast stealing of warmth. Jory gasps and his leg jerks, but your brace holds him.

The thread does slacken—only a hair, enough for one loop to rise from his skin.

You slide the knife tip under that lifted loop and cut a single stitch.

The cut thread snaps back with a wet, whip-like flick and a bead of brine pops free, splattering your knuckles. Jory makes a sound between a sob and a laugh—relief first—then his face drains as the “button” pulses hard, once, and the remaining stitches tighten in answer, drawing the pattern *inward* as if compensating for the lost loop.

At the door, the humming jitter in the salt ridge spikes. The iron across the sill *shifts* with a scrape, nudged from the other side. The bar groans again—still holding, but now under steady pressure, not testing taps.

The seam speaks—not in Merrick’s voice this time, but in a thin chorus, as if several mouths are trying to use one throat:

“Cutting makes room.”

Harker, without looking back, does exactly what you told him. He pours more salt in a thick, choking cascade along the seam and over the iron. “Shut,” he hisses, and packs it down with the flat of his hand until the words smear into muffled vibration. The speaking stops, but the pressure remains.

On Jory’s shin, the cut ends of brine-thread begin to *crawl*—slowly—seeking each other like magnet filings. They don’t reconnect yet, but they’re trying.

Tamsin grips the edge of the table so hard her fingertips whiten. “Wren,” she whispers, barely a sound, “that thing in him—if it’s a bell-clapper—”

Another shove hits the door. The wedge squeals louder. A thin line of blue light appears at the hinge side where Harker’s wax plug is—just a hairline, but new.

### Turn 140 [PLAYER]

I grab the linen and press it hard over the cut ends of the brine-thread, then dump salt into the cloth so it cakes against the stitch points. “Jory—keep breathing with me. Don’t look down.”

To Harker, I nod toward the hinge-side blue line. “Brace that side—now. Anything heavy, wedge it, and salt the crack until it can’t breathe.” Then, quieter to Tamsin as I keep pressure on Jory’s leg: “If it’s a clapper, we don’t let it ring—tell me how to stop a bell without touching the bell.”

*Agent reasoning: The thread is trying to heal itself; I need to stop it from reconnecting and keep Jory grounded. The door is starting to give at the hinge, so we need reinforcement and to keep everyone from feeding it names/words.*

### Turn 141 [GAME]

You mash the linen down over the cut ends and pour salt into the weave until it becomes a stiff, gritty pad. The brine-thread’s slow “seeking” motion stops under the pressure—pinned and choked. Jory’s breathing stutters when the salt hits, then steadies as you keep him anchored with your voice.

“Don’t look down,” you tell him.

He doesn’t. He stares at your mouth like he’s reading the words off your lips. “Okay. Okay.”

The cloth begins to *wet through* from underneath—not blood, but cold brine seeping up. The salt cakes and holds, turning the seep into a paste that stays put. The “button” under the remaining stitches gives a faint, stubborn throb, but it can’t pull the cut ends together while you’ve got them smothered.

Harker moves fast at your nod. He shoulders the hinge-side of the door and shoves a squat sideboard—half a step at a time—until it grinds into place against the jamb. He kicks a chair leg under it as a wedge. “Salt!” he barks, and when Tamsin fumbles the crock toward him, he pours a thick line straight into the new blue hairline. The salt *sizzles* and goes damp; the blue light dims from a line to a sickly dotted glow.

Another shove hits the door. This time the door doesn’t bow as much—your brace holds—but the hinges give a tiny metallic *ping* like a stressed wire.

Tamsin leans in close to you, voice tight and fast. “You stop a bell by damping the air,” she whispers, eyes flicking to Jory’s shin and back. “You pack the mouth. You wrap the clapper so it can’t swing. You—” She swallows. “You make it deaf.”

She reaches for Jory’s leg, then hesitates, not daring to touch the stitchwork. “If that’s a clapper, it wants a chamber. It wants a hollow. Don’t give it one.”

At the door seam, buried under salt, the chorus doesn’t speak—but it *sings* without words: a low vibration that makes the salt ridge tremble and the iron nail-puller skitter a fraction of an inch.

Under your salted linen pad, something answers with a tiny, internal *tick*—not loud, but precise.

Jory’s pupils flare. “Wren,” he whispers, terrified now, “I can hear it. Like… like it’s inside my teeth.”

The threat is clear: whatever is stitched into him is trying to “ring” through his body, and the pressure at the door is steadying—as if it has all the time in the world.

### Turn 142 [PLAYER]

I press my forehead to Jory’s for a second. “Listen to me—if you can hear it, you can outlast it. Bite down on this.” I shove a corner of the linen (clean side) between his teeth like a gag and keep firm pressure on the salted pad at his shin.  

To Tamsin, urgent and low: “Wrap above the knee—tight. Make the leg dead-quiet. Belt, sash, anything.” Then to Harker, without looking up: “If that iron skitters again, pin it—nail it to the sill if you have to.”  

I lean to Jory’s ear. “I’m going to smother it until it can’t tick—tell me if the sound gets louder or if it moves.”

*Agent reasoning: The “ringing” is trying to use Jory as a resonant chamber; I need to damp it immediately with what we have—cloth, salt, pressure—and keep him calm. Also keep the door sealed by focusing Harker and Tamsin on practical bracing without engaging the entity.*

### Turn 143 [GAME]

Your forehead touches Jory’s—cold sweat to cold sweat—just long enough to steal his focus back from the ticking.

He obeys when you push the clean corner of linen between his teeth. His jaw clamps down hard. It muffles the small, involuntary whimpers that keep trying to escape him.

You keep the salted pad pressed to his shin. The brine seep has nowhere to go now; it saturates the cloth and turns the salt into a heavy paste. The paste *sets* like mortar. Under it, the “tick” dulls from crisp to congested—still there, but as if heard through a wall.

Jory’s eyes flick once, sharp, as you speak into his ear. He manages a hoarse, muffled answer around the gag: “—still… here. Not moving. Not louder.” Then, after a breath, “It’s… *angry.*”

Tamsin moves on your instruction like she’s been waiting for permission. She yanks a sash from her own waist—dark, embroidered, too nice for this—and loops it high above Jory’s knee. She pulls until her knuckles go white, twisting the fabric into a tourniquet. Jory’s thigh muscles jump; his foot goes pale at the toes. The ticking stutters once—two quick beats close together—then returns slower, as if the rhythm has to work harder to travel.

At the door, Harker crouches, eyes on the sill now. When the iron nail-puller skitters again—just a nervous scrape in the salt—he swears under his breath and produces two short nails and a small hammer from his coat. He drives one nail down through the iron’s loop into the wood with a sharp *tink—tink—THUNK*. The second nail goes in at an angle like a hook. The iron can’t slide anymore.

The response from the other side is immediate: the pressure stops being a shove and becomes a sustained *lean*, as if someone has put their whole weight against the door and settled in. The sideboard creaks. The hinge-side crack you’d salted begins to weep blue again in tiny dots, like stars appearing one by one.

Then the seam does something worse than talking.

A thin wetness snakes out from under the door—brine, not water—carrying a few grains of salt with it as if it’s learning to eat the barrier. It crawls toward the nearest shadow under the sideboard, seeking a gap.

Tamsin sees it and jerks back, breathing fast. “It’s finding air,” she whispers.

Jory’s eyes widen at the same moment, and he shakes his head once, frantic. Muffled through the linen: “It’s— it’s louder. Not in my teeth. In my… *knee.*”

### Turn 144 [PLAYER]

I snatch up more salt and make a hard, thick ring around the brine trail, then shove a rolled towel or rag—anything—under the sideboard’s shadow to choke the gap, packing salt into it until it’s gritty and airtight.  
To Tamsin, sharp: “Higher—wrap higher, but don’t crush him. We’re chasing it down.”  
I lean close to Jory, steadying his knee with my forearm. “Tell me the second it shifts again—up or down. You’re doing so well. Stay with me.”

*Agent reasoning: The brine is bypassing the salt barrier by seeking gaps and shadows, and the ticking is migrating upward; I need to cut off its “air” path and keep it from climbing Jory’s leg without making things worse.*

### Turn 145 [GAME]

You fling a double handful of salt down in a tight circle around the brine trail. The creeping wetness hits the ring and *halts* as if it’s struck glass—then it starts to bubble at the edge, eating at the grains. It doesn’t cross, but it tests the perimeter, sliding along the inside like something nosing a fence.

You grab a rag from the floor near the stove (old dishcloth, stiff with use), roll it, and jam it under the sideboard where the shadow makes a shallow tunnel. You pack salt into and around it until the cloth turns rigid and gritty. The brine tries to wick into the rag; the salt immediately turns to paste and clogs the fibers. The leak slows to a reluctant seep.

At the door, the sustained lean shifts—someone adjusts their weight. The sideboard creaks, but your plug holds. The hinge-side “stars” of blue light blink dimmer, not gone, just frustrated.

Tamsin moves her wrap higher, as ordered—hands shaking, but precise. She slides the sash up toward the top of Jory’s thigh and loosens a fraction before tightening again, finding a balance between pressure and circulation. Jory’s foot stays pale but not dead-white now.

Jory jerks at your forearm on his knee, eyes wide. Through the linen gag his voice comes out thick and panicked: “—up. Up—” He swallows hard. “It’s… behind my kneecap. Like it’s trying to *hide* there.”

Under your salted pad at his shin, the ticking fades further—nearly gone. But in response, you feel a new, faint vibration under your forearm where you brace his knee: a small, internal *thrum* that wasn’t there before, as if the rhythm has relocated to a deeper joint where your salt and cloth can’t smother it as easily.

Harker, still by the door, glances back sharply. “It’s changing channels,” he snaps, then turns as the brine ring at the threshold suddenly spits a thin thread of wetness sideways—searching for another gap along the baseboard, away from your salt circle.

The threat is now twofold and immediate:
1) Whatever is in Jory is shifting upward toward the knee joint, where it can “ring” more effectively.
2) The brine at the door is probing laterally for an un-salted path under the baseboard, trying to bypass your choke point.

### Turn 146 [PLAYER]

“Harker—don’t chase the thread, draw a wall. Salt the whole baseboard from the door to the hearth, thick as a finger. No gaps.”  

I shift closer to Jory’s knee, keeping my forearm braced, and grab whatever cloth I can—my own scarf if I have to—wrapping it snug around the knee joint. “Tamsin, help me—pack salt into the wrap at the back of his knee, right where he feels it hiding.”  

I lean in, eyes locked on Jory’s. “Up behind the kneecap—good. Tell me if it tries to climb higher than the wrap, or if it drops back down toward the shin.”

*Agent reasoning: I can’t let the door find a gap, but Jory is my priority—if it rings through his knee we lose him. I’ll direct Harker to lay a continuous salt line along the baseboard while I try to “deafen” the knee by binding and salting around the joint without cutting more stitches.*

### Turn 147 [GAME]

Harker doesn’t argue. He grabs the salt crock and, instead of chasing the wandering brine thread, he pours a continuous ridge along the baseboard—starting at the door jamb and moving fast toward the hearth. He uses his boot toe to shove it into a thick, uninterrupted berm, finger-width and then some.

The probing brine reaches the baseboard, finds the new salt wall, and recoils—flattening into a trembling smear that can’t get purchase. It tries twice more, each attempt shorter, before it settles into a slow, frustrated seep under the door that goes nowhere.

At Jory’s knee, you pull off your scarf and wrap it snug around the joint, overlapping layers until the bend of the knee is bound. Tamsin immediately cups a handful of salt and packs it into the back of the wrap—right into the hollow behind the kneecap. The salt bites into damp fabric and turns heavy, forming a stiff, gritty bolster that fills the “hiding place.”

Jory’s whole leg spasms once—hard—then stills. His eyes squeeze shut; his brows knot. A strangled sound pushes into the linen gag, then stops when you hold his gaze again.

The internal thrum under your forearm falters. For two heartbeats it feels like something *pressing* against the wrap from inside, testing for give. Then the rhythm breaks: thrum—pause—thrum—long pause. The sensation doesn’t vanish, but it’s no longer building. It’s contained.

Jory forces his eyes open, staring straight at you. Muffled, precise: “It’s… stuck. It tried to go up. It can’t.” He swallows, and his gaze flicks down toward his shin. “It’s… dropping. Back down. Quiet.”

Under the salted pad at his shin, you feel one faint, resentful *tick*—then nothing you can distinguish from your own pulse.

At the door, the sustained lean releases. Not a retreat—more like a decision. The blue dots in the hinge crack dim to almost nothing.

Then a new sound replaces the pressure: a slow, deliberate scratching along the outside of the door, low near the lock, like a nail searching for a seam. Harker goes rigid, listening.

Tamsin whispers, barely audible: “It’s not trying to get in the way it was.”

The immediate threat has shifted: the brine can’t bypass your salt barrier now, but whatever is outside has stopped brute forcing the door and has begun working at the lock/edge—methodical, patient, and close.

### Turn 148 [PLAYER]

I keep my palm firm on Jory’s wrapped knee and whisper, “Good—quiet is what we want. Stay with me.” Then, without looking away from him, I tell Harker, “Salt the lock and the keyhole—pack it in with wax if you’ve got it. If it’s using a nail, give it nothing to catch.”  

I glance to Tamsin. “Find us a back way out—window, cellar hatch, anything. And bring me something rigid I can splint his leg with.”  

Low to Jory’s ear: “If you hear it tick again, you tell me—immediately. Even if it’s just a whisper of sound.”

*Agent reasoning: The thing outside has changed tactics to the lock; we need to slow it without breaking our focus on Jory. I’ll keep Jory contained while directing Harker/Tamsin to reinforce the lock edge and prepare an escape route if the door fails.*

### Turn 150 [PLAYER]

I keep my hand firm on Jory’s wrapped knee, voice low. “Good—quiet is what we want. Stay with me.”  

Without looking away from him, I call to Harker, “Salt the lock and keyhole—pack it in, and if you’ve got wax or tallow, seal it. Give it nothing to catch.”  

I flick my eyes to Tamsin. “Find a back way out—window, cellar hatch, anything. And bring me something rigid to splint his leg.”  

Then I lean to Jory’s ear. “If you hear it tick again, you tell me immediately—even if it’s only a whisper.”

*Agent reasoning: The scratching at the lock sounds like it’s trying to pick or pry its way in; I need to keep Jory calm and immobile while directing Harker to block the lock and Tamsin to find an escape and splint materials.*

### Turn 151 [GAME]

Your hand stays firm on the salted wrap. Jory’s breathing evens out in short, controlled pulls. His eyes stay on yours like you’re a nail holding him to the room.

Harker moves immediately. He drags the salt crock to the door, crouches, and shoves salt into the keyhole with the blunt end of a spoon—packing it until it mounds and spills. The scratching outside pauses the moment the salt hits metal, then resumes higher, closer to the latch.

“Wax,” Harker mutters. He glances toward the stove and snatches a stubby candle from the mantle. He lights it off the low flame, lets it drip, and smears hot wax over the salted keyhole and along the seam where the lock plate meets the door. The wax hisses faintly as it cools.

Outside, the nail (or whatever is doing the work) scrapes once—hard—right over the lock area. The door shudders. A thin line of wax fractures, but holds. Then the sound changes: not scratching now, but a careful *pressing* along the edge, as if something flat is being slid into the seam to feel for weakness.

Tamsin nods and darts away from the kitchen, skirts gathered in both hands. You hear cupboards open, a hurried rummage, then her voice from the back hall: “Cellar’s through the pantry—there’s a hatch!”

A beat later: “Window’s painted shut—won’t budge!”

She returns with a rigid length of wood—a broken chair slat, still attached to a crosspiece like a crude brace—and a strip of twine. “This was all I could find,” she says, breathless, holding it out.

Jory flinches as the pressure at the door increases—he’s listening as much as you are. You lean close and give your instruction.

He swallows, then whispers through the linen, urgent and hoarse: “I— I don’t hear ticking. But… I feel it. Like… like a finger tapping from inside the bone.”

At the same moment, the salted wrap behind his knee darkens in one spot—damp spreading through the fabric from within, not from the outside. The salt there begins to clump and sag.

At the door, the seam gives a hair’s breadth with a soft *click*—not open, but loosened. Whatever is outside has found something to worry at.

You have two immediate, concrete problems:
1) The thing in Jory is wetting the wrap from the inside and may be dissolving its own salt barrier at the back of the knee.
2) The door’s lock seam has shifted; the outside presence is actively working the gap and is closer to forcing entry than it was seconds ago.

### Turn 152 [PLAYER]

I take the chair slat from Tamsin and lash it against Jory’s leg—shin to thigh—tight enough to keep the knee from bending, then shove fresh salt into the damp spot behind his knee until it’s a hard crust again. “Don’t move it, Jory—let it sulk.”

I look up at Harker, voice sharp. “Brace the door—sideboard, table, anything—now. Then to the pantry; we’re going down.” 

To Tamsin, already pulling Jory toward me, “You lead—hatch open, clear the stairs. And if you see a lantern, light it.”

*Agent reasoning: Jory’s containment is failing at the knee, but if the door opens we’re all finished; I’ll keep Jory stable while directing a quick brace and pushing us toward the cellar escape.*

### Turn 154 [PLAYER]

I snatch the chair slat from Tamsin and lash it along Jory’s leg—shin to thigh—tight enough that his knee can’t bend, then I grind fresh salt into the damp spot behind his kneecap until it crusts hard again. “Don’t fight it, Jory—let it sulk.”  

I snap my eyes up at Harker. “Brace the door—sideboard, table, whatever you’ve got. Now. Then pantry—down we go.”  

To Tamsin, already hauling Jory’s weight into me, “You lead—get the hatch open and clear the stairs. Find a lantern if there is one.”

*Agent reasoning: Jory’s knee wrap is failing from internal damp and the door’s seam is giving; we need to immobilize his leg, re-salt the weak point, and get everyone moving to the cellar before whatever’s outside forces entry.*

### Turn 156 [PLAYER]

I strap the chair slat tight along Jory’s leg from thigh to shin, then press fresh salt into the damp spot behind his knee until it cakes into a hard crust. “Easy, Jory—don’t move it. Let it sulk.”

I look to Harker. “Brace the door with anything heavy—now. Then pantry, we’re going down.”

I nod Tamsin toward the back. “Lead us—hatch open, clear the stairs, and if there’s a lantern, light it.”

*Agent reasoning: The door is close to giving and Jory’s knee barrier is weakening; I need to immobilize him, reinforce the salt, and get us into the cellar fast while Harker buys time.*

### Turn 157 [GAME]

The chair slat bites into Jory’s trouser leg as you lash it tight—thigh to shin—until his knee can’t flex without the whole brace resisting. He hisses through his teeth but nods, gripping the edge of the counter with white knuckles.

You press salt into the damp patch behind his kneecap. It cakes fast—wet to paste to crust—until it’s a hard, gritty scab over the linen. For a breath, the seepage stops.

Then the crust *ticks* once. Not a sound in the room—more like a tiny movement you feel through your fingertips. Jory goes still as if you’ve pinned a live wire. “It’s… mad,” he whispers. “Like it’s testing.”

Harker doesn’t argue. He lunges for the sideboard by the wall and heaves it—wood screeching over the floorboards—into a slam against the door. He shoves the kitchen table in behind it, wedging the legs so the whole stack braces at an angle.

The outside pressure answers immediately. The door bows inward a fraction and the wax along the lock seam cracks in a jagged line. Something thin scrapes along the gap—metal on wood—trying to find purchase. The braced furniture holds, but you hear the latch plate *creak* under strain.

“Pantry!” Harker snaps, already moving.

Tamsin leads hard, shoulder under Jory’s arm, guiding him across the back hall. She yanks the pantry door open. Shelves rattle—jars clink. She drops to her knees and claws aside a sack of flour and a basket of onions, revealing a square hatch in the floor with an iron ring.

She pulls. The hatch doesn’t open.

“Swelled shut,” she says, voice tight, and plants both feet for leverage. She hauls again. The ring bites her palm; she swears, then tries a third time.

The hatch gives—sudden and ugly—releasing a breath of cold air that smells of damp stone and old apples. The dark below is absolute.

Tamsin leans down into it, feeling for the first step. “Lantern—” She pats the shelf, finds one by touch, and fumbles for a match.

From the kitchen, the braced door *thumps* again—harder. The sideboard shifts a finger’s width, leaving a fresh gouge in the floor. And from Jory’s leg, under the salted crust, you feel another tiny, deliberate *tick*, as if whatever’s inside is counting the steps you’re about to take.

### Turn 158 [PLAYER]

I cup my hand over the salted crust behind Jory’s knee—firm, warning pressure—then snatch the matchbook from Tamsin’s fumbling fingers and strike one hard. “Lantern. Now.”  

As the flame catches, I hiss to Tamsin, “Down first—three steps, tell me if they’re sound.” Then to Harker, without looking back, “Last one down. If that door gives, you cut it off and follow—don’t be brave.”  

I shift Jory’s arm across my shoulders and steer him to the hatch. “Eyes on me,” I murmur to him, and start easing him toward the first step once the lantern throws enough light to see stone.

*Agent reasoning: The door won’t hold forever and the ticking is escalating; we need to get underground fast, but I can’t let Jory go first in the dark. I’ll get the lantern lit, keep a hand on the salt crust to monitor it, and send Tamsin down to secure footing while Harker brings up the rear.*

### Turn 159 [GAME]

Your palm over the salted crust steadies Jory—more importantly, you feel what he can’t quite name: the crust is holding, but it’s not inert. Under your hand, the “tick” becomes a faint, patient *press*, like something leaning back.

You snatch the matchbook, strike hard. The match flares sulfur-bright, and you jam it to the lantern’s wick. The lantern catches with a low *whuff* and a thin, oily smoke that curls up into the pantry air.

“Good,” Tamsin breathes, and immediately swings her legs into the hatch. She takes the lantern from you with both hands, lowers it first, and tests the first step with her boot.

“One,” she says. The stone holds.

“Two.” A gritty scrape—sound enough.

“Three.” She shifts her weight fully. “Sound. Damp, but sound.”

Behind you, the braced door takes another hit—this time not a thump but a *shove* that drags. Wood groans. The sideboard judders and slides another inch, leaving a bright raw streak in the floor. Harker glances once at the door, then at you, jaw clenched, and plants himself between it and the pantry as if to buy seconds.

“Go,” he says, voice flat. He reaches down and—without ceremony—hooks a finger through the pantry latch so it won’t swing shut on you.

You get Jory’s arm across your shoulders and steer him to the hatch. He obeys your “eyes on me” like it’s a rope to hold. His breath comes fast; sweat beads at his temple.

As you ease him toward the first step, the lantern light spills down the cellar stairwell, revealing stone steps slick with moisture and a wall lined with old shelves—empty except for a few dust-matted bottles. The air below is colder, and it carries a faint brine note that doesn’t belong in a pantry cellar.

Jory’s braced leg meets the first step awkwardly. When he puts weight on it, the salted crust behind his knee *cracks*—a hairline fracture you feel through the linen.

He flinches, and something threads a thin wetness under your palm again—slow, testing, not a gush.

From the kitchen, the latch plate gives a sharp metallic *ping*. The door doesn’t open yet, but the sound is unmistakable: whatever is working the seam has found a weak point.

Harker’s head snaps toward it. “Move,” he orders—no bravado, just urgency—as he reaches for the knife block on the counter on his way to the hatch.

### Turn 160 [PLAYER]

I clamp my hand harder over the cracked salt and half-carry, half-slide Jory down onto the first step. “One at a time—don’t rush your footing, just follow my voice.”

I call up to Harker, “Take the knife, then shut the pantry door behind you—don’t leave us a straight line.” 

To Tamsin, low and quick, “When Jory’s down, find anything down there we can barricade with—crates, a door, anything—and tell me if you smell the sea stronger.”

*Agent reasoning: Jory’s salt seal is failing and the door is about to give; I need to get him down fast while keeping pressure on the crack, and make sure Harker doesn’t get trapped upstairs.*

### Turn 161 [GAME]

Your grip over the cracked salt turns firm enough to hurt. The crust doesn’t fully give, but it grinds under your palm—granular, unstable. Jory’s breath stutters as you half-carry, half-slide him down onto the first step.

His boot finds the edge. His braced leg won’t bend properly, so he has to come down stiff, like lowering a plank. He mutters, “I’m— I’m with you,” and keeps his eyes on your face like you asked, blinking too hard.

Behind your hand, the dampness presses again. Not flowing—*seeking*. The linen stays in place, but the salt’s hairline crack widens a fraction.

Tamsin, already three steps down, shifts to the side to make room. She takes the lantern higher, angling it so the light throws across the stairwell and the cellar floor. “There’s a worktable,” she says, scanning. “And crates—two, maybe three. Looks like storage.”

You call up to Harker. He snatches a kitchen knife—short, heavy—and then grabs the pantry door with his free hand.

The kitchen door upstairs slams inward a palm’s width with a splintering *pop*. The sideboard jerks. A thin, pale shape—like a long wet finger or strip of kelp—slips into the gap and hooks, testing. Harker swears and yanks the pantry door toward him.

The pantry door closes, but not cleanly: it catches on a jar that’s rolled under it and leaves a wedge of space—an inch, maybe two—near the bottom. Harker stamps the jar aside and shoves again until the door thuds shut.

It doesn’t latch.

Something scrapes along the pantry door from the other side—slow, exploratory—then stops as if listening.

Tamsin leans toward the cellar air, nostrils flaring. “Yes,” she says, voice gone tight. “Stronger. Like low tide in a closed room.”

As you guide Jory down toward the second step, the lantern light reveals a dark wet track on the stone below—fresh, not old damp—leading from the far corner of the cellar toward the base of the stairs, as if something has recently been dragged, or has crawled, and left the floor shining.

Above, Harker’s boots shift. “I’m coming,” he calls, quieter now. “Wren—move him. That pantry door won’t hold if it decides to push.”

### Turn 162 [PLAYER]

“Alright—second step, Jory. Good. Keep breathing with me.” I shift his weight carefully, keeping my palm clamped over the cracked salt, and angle us down fast but steady.

“Tamsin—lantern on that wet track, but don’t follow it. Get the crates by the worktable and start stacking them at the foot of the stairs—leave a gap for Harker, then close it.” 

I call up, sharper, “Harker, come now—don’t wait for it to choose. Slide down and kick the hatch shut after you if you can.”

*Agent reasoning: The salt seal is failing and something is already in the house; we need distance from the stairs and a barricade while keeping Jory calm. The wet track suggests something in the cellar too, so I’ll avoid it and get us onto higher ground near the worktable/crates, then help Harker down quickly.*

### Turn 163 [GAME]

Jory gets his braced leg down onto the second step with a strangled sound, but he does it. You keep him moving—fast enough to matter, slow enough not to spill him. His fingers clamp around your sleeve so hard you’ll have crescent bruises later.

Under your palm, the cracked salt finally gives a little: a soft *crunch* and a faint warmth of fresh wetness that seeps into the linen. The “seeking” pressure stops for half a beat—then resumes, more insistent, as if it’s found the weak seam.

Tamsin swings the lantern beam toward the wet track. The light catches it like oil: a glossy line that isn’t just water—there are tiny dark flecks in it, like silt or ground pepper. She swallows, then moves—quick, practical. She drags the nearest crate from under the worktable, then a second. Wood scrapes harshly on stone.

“Two crates,” she reports, breathless. “There’s a third wedged—give me a second.”

Upstairs, your sharper call lands.

Harker doesn’t argue. You hear his boots thud across the pantry floor, then the scrape of him turning and committing to the hatch. He drops feet-first, one hand on the frame, knife clenched in the other.

At that exact moment, something hits the pantry door from the kitchen side—not a shoulder-check, but a *hook-and-pull*. The door bows inward and the latch finally gives with a flat *clack*. A cold seam of air knifes down the stairwell.

Harker lands hard on the third step, boots skidding on damp stone. He catches himself with his free hand, knife up, eyes wide.

Above him, through the open pantry doorway, you see it clearly for the first time in the lantern-spill: a thin, pale length—like kelp made of tendon—snaking low across the pantry floor. It’s not a person. It moves with deliberate, jointless patience, and where it touches wood, the surface darkens as if soaked.

It probes the hatch opening, tasting the air.

Harker twists and kicks upward. The hatch swings, but it doesn’t seal—something catches it from above, resisting with a steady pull. The iron ring rattles violently.

“Something’s holding it,” Harker snaps, bracing his shoulder into the stairwell wall. “Wren—down. Now.”

Tamsin shoves the two crates into place at the foot of the stairs, leaving a narrow gap. “Gap for Harker!” she calls, then reaches for the third crate—hands shaking, but moving.

### Turn 164 [PLAYER]

I haul Jory down the last steps as gently as I can and steer him behind the crates, then I rip my hand away long enough to fling a fistful of salt up toward the hatch opening. “Harker—cut whatever’s got the ring! Don’t let it anchor!”

I press back onto the wet spot behind Jory’s knee, voice low and shaking. “Stay with me. Tamsin, close that gap the second Harker’s through—no heroics.”

*Agent reasoning: That thing is in the doorway and the hatch won’t shut; my priority is getting Jory off the stairs and helping Harker break whatever’s holding the hatch, then barricade immediately—my salt is failing and I’m scared it’s tracking us.*

### Turn 165 [GAME]

You get Jory down the last steps in a careful, ugly slide—his brace knocks stone twice, but he doesn’t fall. You tuck him behind the half-stacked crates where the worktable and shelves break line of sight from the stairs.

The moment you lift your hand from the back of his knee, the linen there darkens fast—wet spreading in a thumbprint shape. The skin beneath looks puckered, as if it’s been held under saltwater too long. Jory’s jaw clenches; he makes a thin sound through his teeth but stays with you.

You snatch a fistful of loose salt from the crust and fling it up toward the hatch.

The salt hits the pale, kelp-like length at the opening and *hisses*—not loud, but sharp, like fat on a pan. The thing recoils a few inches, twitching, and the air fills with a sudden iodine sting. For a heartbeat, the pull on the hatch ring weakens.

“Harker—now!” you bark.

Harker doesn’t hesitate. He lunges up two steps, arm extended, and slashes at what’s holding the ring. The knife catches—*cuts*—and a pale strip snaps back like a severed tendon. Dark brine spatters the hatch frame and Harker’s sleeve.

The hatch drops halfway… then jerks again, yanked from above by a second line you didn’t see—thinner, almost transparent in the lantern light. It tightens around the iron ring with a wet squeal.

Harker’s face goes tight with panic he refuses to show. “There’s another—” he starts, and the line *pulls*.

He loses his footing. His boots skid on the damp step and he slams down hard on his hip, knife clattering once against stone before he snatches it back.

Tamsin drags the third crate into place with a grunt, eyes locked on Harker. She holds it poised, ready to shove.

The pale thing at the hatch doesn’t come down yet. Instead, it threads farther into the stairwell—testing the air, then dipping toward the brine-wet track on the cellar floor as if it recognizes it. Where it passes, the lantern flame gutters and leans blue for a second.

Jory grabs your wrist suddenly, nails biting. “It’s—following the wet,” he whispers, eyes huge. “Wren… it likes the trail.”

Harker scrambles backward down the steps toward the gap, breathing hard. “Close it the second I’m through,” he snaps at Tamsin—then, to you, “Salt buys seconds. Not minutes.”

### Turn 166 [PLAYER]

“Harker—move, now!” I grab Jory’s sleeve and press it hard to the back of his knee, trying to blot the wet, then hiss to Tamsin, “Shove the crate as soon as he’s through—pin it.”

As Harker drops into the gap, I scatter a thick line of salt across the wet track on the cellar floor, sweeping it wider with my boot to break the shine. “No more trail,” I mutter, then to Jory, softer, “Hold still—let me pack it again.”

*Agent reasoning: The creature is tracking moisture; Jory’s wound and the wet track are lures. I need Harker down and the barricade closed, then disrupt the trail with salt and get Jory’s leg re-crusted while keeping everyone calm.*

### Turn 167 [GAME]

Harker moves—fast, ugly, committed. He half-falls through the gap between the crates and the stair, boots scraping, shoulder twisting so he doesn’t snag. The instant his hips clear, Tamsin drives the third crate in with all her weight.

Wood slams wood. The gap vanishes.

The crate stack shudders, then holds—pinned tight against the stair’s bottom step. Tamsin braces it with her forearms and spits out, “Done. Don’t—don’t make me do that again.”

You mash Jory’s sleeve to the back of his knee. It drinks up brine-dark wetness immediately. The soaked fabric clings like cold seaweed. Jory goes rigid, breath caught high in his chest, but he stays still when you tell him.

On the cellar floor, your salt goes down in a thick, pale arc across the wet track. You sweep it broader with your boot until the shine breaks into dull, gritty patches.

It works—partly.

Where the salt hits, the glossy line *stops spreading* and the air gives that same pan-hiss you heard at the hatch. The wetness doesn’t cross the salt easily. But the track doesn’t vanish; it beads up against the salt like a tide meeting a seawall, gathering into darker, thicker droplets.

Above the crates, something tests the barrier: a pale filament snakes down between two slats, searching for a gap. It touches the salted line and recoils sharply, whipping back out of sight.

Then the hatch ring overhead shrieks—metal on metal—as whatever is up there pulls again. The hatch doesn’t open now, but it *thuds* and *flexes* against its frame, sending dust down like dry grit-snow.

Harker, on your side of the crates, scrambles backward on hands and heels until his back hits the worktable. He holds the knife up, blade trembling. His sleeve is splattered with dark brine that’s already eating the fabric into tiny holes.

“It’s anchored upstairs,” he says, voice tight. “More than one line. And it knows where we are.”

Tamsin keeps one hand on the crates, the other on the lantern. The flame leans blue again for a second as the hatch thuds—then steadies. “We can’t stay under it,” she says. “If the wood gives, it drops right into us.”

Jory swallows hard. “Wren,” he whispers, eyes fixed on your salt line. “It’s pooling. Like it’s learning.”

### Turn 168 [PLAYER]

I swallow hard and force my voice steady. “Then we don’t stay under it—Tamsin, lantern up and forward. Find us another way out. A coal chute, a door, anything.”

I tear a strip from the hem of my shirt and pack it hard against the back of Jory’s knee, then pour a careful pinch of salt around the edges, not on the rawest part. “Bite down on your sleeve if you need to—don’t look at it.”

To Harker, I nod at his ruined sleeve. “Your arm—keep the brine off your skin. Wrap it.” Then I start laying a second, thicker crescent of salt closer to the crates, widening our “no-cross” line. “And if that hatch drops, we run—no stopping to fight it.”

*Agent reasoning: We can’t hold this spot if the hatch gives; salt seems to repel it, so I’ll reinforce barriers and get us moving deeper while tending Jory’s wound. I’ll also check for another exit and keep the group coordinated.*

### Turn 170 [PLAYER]

“Tamsin—lantern up and forward. Find us a door, a chute, anything that isn’t those stairs.”

I tear a strip from my shirt and pack it hard behind Jory’s knee, then dust salt around the edges only. “Bite your sleeve if you have to—don’t look.”

I glance at Harker’s eaten sleeve. “Wrap your arm—keep that brine off your skin,” and I lay a thicker crescent of salt nearer the crates. “If the hatch drops, we run. No heroics.”

*Agent reasoning: The cellar feels like it’s turning into a trap; I need light and an exit, but I can’t abandon Jory’s wound or let Harker’s brine burn him. I’ll delegate: Tamsin scouts with the lantern while I reinforce the salt barrier and stabilize Jory, and I’ll push Harker to wrap his arm and stay ready to move.*

### Turn 171 [GAME]

Tamsin lifts the lantern and moves—low, quick steps, keeping the light aimed away from the crate-stack so she doesn’t silhouette you. The cellar opens into a cluttered storage run: shelves of jars, coffin hardware in labeled tins, old mourning cloth folded in oilpaper. She sweeps the lantern beam left.

“Door,” she says—then corrects herself when she gets closer. “Not a door. A… panel.”

It’s a narrow wooden panel set into the stone, waist-high, with an iron pull. The edges are swollen with damp, and someone has painted a thin white line around it—old warding chalk, half dissolved. Tamsin grabs the pull and tugs. It doesn’t budge.

She plants a boot and pulls again. The panel gives a millimeter, then sticks with a wet suction sound.

Behind you, you tear cloth from your shirt and pack it behind Jory’s knee. He bites down hard on his sleeve, eyes squeezed shut. The bleeding slows—more seep than pour now—but the skin around the wound remains waterlogged-looking, as if the brine has soaked into him rather than just the fabric.

You dust salt around the edges. The salt doesn’t burn him, but it *does* fizz faintly where it touches the brine-wet cloth—tiny bubbles, like the wound is exhaling.

Harker yanks his own scarf free and wraps his forearm over the chewed sleeve, tight. “It stings,” he says, voice clipped. “It’s trying to—” He stops, swallowing. “It’s trying to get under.”

You lay your thicker crescent of salt nearer the crates. The pooled brine at the first line beads and presses, but doesn’t cross. It builds into a dark, trembling ridge that reflects the lantern like an eye.

Then the crate-stack *knocks*—a single, heavy impact from above, as if something dropped its weight onto the hatch and slid down onto the crates. Dust sifts. The lantern flame leans blue and stays that way a beat too long.

A thin filament snakes through a crack between the top crate and the wall—higher than before—seeking a path around your salt rather than through it.

Tamsin looks back, breath sharp. “Wren—this panel’s an exit, I think, but it’s swollen shut. I need help or a tool.”

Jory’s voice comes muffled through his sleeve, panicked but controlled. “It’s—going around. Not through.”

The threat is now clear: whatever is above is probing for gaps around the barricade, and the hatch/crates are taking impacts that could eventually shift the stack.

### Turn 172 [PLAYER]

I grab the lantern shelf for balance and hurry to Tamsin, keeping my shoulder between her light and the crates. “Don’t smear the chalk—work the center,” I murmur, then wedge my fingers under the iron pull and lean my weight into a slow, steady pry. 

Over my shoulder I call, “Harker—knife that filament if it shows again, and shove salt into any crack it finds. Jory, stay down and keep pressure—talk to me if you feel it moving.”

*Agent reasoning: The panel is our best exit and the chalk suggests it matters; I’ll help Tamsin force it without breaking the ward, while keeping Jory safe and having Harker deal with the filament/gaps.*

### Turn 173 [GAME]

You get to the chalk-lined panel without flashing the lantern straight back into the cellar. Your shoulder blocks most of the beam, and Tamsin obligingly angles it down at the floor and the panel seam.

“Center. Got it,” she breathes, and keeps her fingers off the chalk ring.

You hook your fingers under the iron pull. The metal is cold enough to bite. You lean—slow, controlled—using the lantern shelf as a brace.

At first, nothing.

Then the panel gives with a thick, wet *schlorp*, like pulling a boot out of mud. The seam opens a finger’s width. Damp air pushes out, smelling of soot, old rain, and something mineral—brick dust. You keep the pressure steady and the gap widens to two fingers… three.

A second consequence comes with it: the chalk line around the panel fractures in one spot as the wood flexes, a hairline break you can’t avoid. The ward isn’t gone, but it’s no longer unbroken.

Tamsin slips her fingertips into the widening seam and helps you pull. The panel swings inward a few inches on stiff hinges, revealing a narrow chute-like passage: brick-lined, steep, and dark, with iron rungs set into one side. It goes up, not down.

“Coal chute,” Tamsin says. “Or an old ash run.”

Behind you, Harker snaps, “There!” His knife hand flashes.

A pale filament threads through the crate crack again—now thicker, like a wet cord. Harker slashes. The blade *does* cut it, but the filament doesn’t bleed; it recoils and the severed end lashes once on the cellar side, spattering a fan of brine across the floorboards.

Where the brine lands, it starts to creep—avoiding your salt crescent, but flowing toward the chalk-lined panel like it’s been given a new scent.

Harker, breathing hard, shoves a pinch of salt into the crate crack with his free hand. The salt hisses and the crack goes still.

Jory calls out hoarsely from the floor, “It’s—cold—” He grits his teeth. “Behind my knee. Like something’s trying to pull the wet deeper.”

The immediate threat is now twofold and concrete: the hatch-and-crate barrier is being probed by brine-filaments, and spilled brine is actively creeping toward your newly opened exit seam, where the warding chalk has a break.

### Turn 174 [PLAYER]

“Tamsin—salt the chalk break. Pack it like grout, right now.” I drop to a knee and drag a thick line of salt in a tight half-circle in front of the panel seam, then grab my sea-glass charm and press it into the fracture in the chalk as a stopgap.  

I look back at Harker, voice sharp. “Keep it off this doorway—if brine reaches the seam, we’re done.” Then I crawl to Jory and slide an arm under his shoulders. “I’m sorry,” I whisper, and try to haul him up toward the chute. “Can you climb rungs, or do we need to tie you and pull?”

*Agent reasoning: The brine is homing on the broken chalk and our only exit; I need to reseal the ward fast and get Jory moving, even if it’s clumsy and painful. Wren would prioritize containment and gentleness, but push through fear to act.*

### Turn 175 [GAME]

Tamsin drops instantly to the panel and pinches salt into the hairline break in the chalk ring, pressing it in with the flat of her thumb like mortar. “Hold—hold—” she mutters, packing until the crack is a white, gritty scar. The salt bites at the damp wood; a faint fizzing starts where moisture seeps.

You drag your own thick half-circle of salt in front of the seam. The line is dense, not a dusting—bright and deliberate. When you press your sea-glass charm into the fractured chalk, it seats with a small *click* against the stone, and for a second the lantern’s blue lean steadies toward normal amber.

The creeping brine reaches the edge of your new salt half-circle and stalls, bunching up into a glossy ridge. It tries once—thin tendrils testing for a weak point—then draws back, as if reconsidering.

Harker takes your warning seriously. He steps between the crates and the panel, knife out, and starts *scraping* salt into any floor crack that points toward the doorway. “On it,” he says. His wrapped arm trembles, but he keeps moving.

You crawl to Jory and slide an arm under his shoulders. He’s heavier than he looks—deadweight from pain and shock. When you haul, he makes a strangled sound and clamps his teeth on his sleeve again.

“I can—” he gasps, then shakes his head hard. “Not… rungs. Not with this leg.”

As you shift him, the brine-wet cloth at his knee drags across the floorboards and leaves a smeared, damp trail behind—thin, but real. The smear immediately begins to creep, not toward your salt line, but *toward you*, as if it recognizes the moving source.

From above the crates, another impact hits—harder. The stack shudders; a tin of coffin nails on a nearby shelf rattles and tips, spilling with a bright scatter.

Tamsin looks over her shoulder, eyes wide. “Wren—if we don’t get him up now, that hatch is coming down. The chute’s narrow—one at a time.”

Clear situation:
- The warded panel is holding *for the moment*; your salt line and sea-glass plug have stopped the brine at the seam.
- Jory cannot climb the iron rungs with his injured leg.
- The crate stack is being struck from above and is starting to shift; another hit could drop it and open a path.
- Jory’s movement is leaving a brine smear that is beginning to “wake” and creep.

“Tamsin—up. Now. Get to the first landing or wherever it opens and brace yourself; tie off a line if you find one.”  

I snatch a length of sacking from the nearest shelf and knot it under Jory’s arms and around his chest like a rough sling, then dust salt over the fresh smear behind his knee. “Jory—look at me. We’re hauling, not climbing. Can you hold on with your hands?”  

I thrust the sling’s end toward Harker. “Help me drag him to the chute—then you climb after me. And keep that knife ready; if the crates shift, we don’t stop.”

*Agent reasoning: Jory can’t climb, and the brine is tracking him—if we hesitate, we lose the exit. I’ll send Tamsin up first to anchor a pull, then improvise a harness from my torn shirt and whatever rope/sacking is nearby, even if it’s clumsy.*

“Tamsin—up. Now. Get to the first landing, wherever it opens, and find something to brace or tie off.”

I yank a length of sacking loose and knot it under Jory’s arms and across his chest into a rough sling, then throw salt over the wet smear by his knee. “Jory—eyes on me. We’re hauling, not climbing. Can you hold with your hands?”

I shove the sling’s end toward Harker. “Drag with me—straight to the chute. You climb after I get him started, and keep that knife ready. If the crates shift, we don’t stop.”

*Agent reasoning: The chute is our only clean exit and Jory can’t climb; Tamsin is the best choice to go first and anchor us. I’m scared the brine will follow his smear, so I need salt control while we move fast, and I need Harker’s strength and knife arm to get Jory to the rungs.*

“Tamsin—go, now. Up the rungs; find a landing and something solid to brace or tie off to.”

I cinch the sacking under Jory’s arms, tight enough to hold his weight, and dust salt hard over the wet smear by his knee. “Jory—look at me. Hands work? Then you hold on and breathe with me.”

I shove the sling’s end into Harker’s grip. “Pull with me—straight to the chute. Knife in your other hand; if the crates shift, we don’t stop.”

*Agent reasoning: The last thing I did was organize the escape—Tamsin up first, then haul Jory with a sling while Harker guards. The immediate danger is the crate stack/hatch shifting and brine tracking our movement, so I need to move fast, keep the seam protected with salt, and get Jory into the chute without letting the smear spread.*

“Tamsin—go, now. Up the rungs; find a landing and something solid to brace or tie off to.”

I cinch the sacking under Jory’s arms and across his chest, then grind salt into the wet smear by his knee with my palm. “Jory—look at me. Hands work? Then you hold on and breathe with me.”

I shove the sling’s end into Harker’s grip. “Pull with me—straight to the chute. Knife in your other hand; if the crates shift, we don’t stop.”

*Agent reasoning: Tamsin needs to get above and secure a tie-off while Harker and I move Jory immediately; the brine smear has to be salted and we can’t pause if the crates collapse.*

### Turn 183 [GAME]

Tamsin doesn’t argue. She grabs the rungs with both hands and goes up fast, boots scraping wood. The ladder flexes with each step. Above, you hear her breath catch as she finds an opening—then her voice, thin but steady.

“Landing—yes. It’s a service lip, maybe two feet deep. There’s a ring-bolt set into a beam—rusted but it’s *there*.”

Below, you cinch the sacking tight under Jory’s arms. He makes a strangled sound, then forces his fingers to curl around the sling and his own shirtfront like he’s afraid his hands will forget how. His eyes fix on you; he nods once, sharp and obedient.

When you grind salt into the wet smear at his knee, it reacts immediately: the sheen dulls from slick-black to a crusted gray, like something drying too fast. A sharp brine-stink rises. Jory hisses through his teeth, then his leg stops twitching. Not healed—just… stilled.

Harker takes the sling end in his left hand and keeps the knife up in his right, blade angled toward the shadowed stacks. “On three,” he says, and actually means it.

You both haul.

Jory’s body slides over the boards toward the chute-mouth—an angled gap between crates where the floor drops away. The first pull goes clean. The second pull jerks hard as the sacking bites under his ribs; Jory’s hands clamp tighter, knuckles whitening.

Then a crate above you shifts—wood groaning, nails complaining. Dust sifts down in a steady sprinkle. Harker freezes for half a heartbeat, knife lifting higher.

From inside the dark between the crates comes a soft, wet *click-click*, like a tongue against teeth—too rhythmic to be settling timber.

Tamsin, from above: “Hurry. The ring-bolt’ll take a line but the beam’s… Wren, it’s *soft*. Like it’s been soaked.”

You have Jory started toward the chute, but the stacks are moving, and something in the gaps is awake and tracking the sound of you dragging him.

### Turn 184 [PLAYER]

“Harker—don’t look for it. Just cut whatever comes out.” I scoop a fistful of salt and fling it hard into the gap where the click-click is coming from, then immediately haul again, dragging Jory the last stretch to the chute-mouth.

“Tamsin—run the line through the ring-bolt anyway, then around anything *metal* you can find up there—pipe, rail, bracket—don’t trust the beam!” I lean in close to Jory, voice tight. “Hands only. When I say, you slide—don’t fight it.”

I brace my boots, feed the sling forward, and start easing Jory into the chute while keeping my free hand ready to grab my sea-glass charm if the brine surges.

*Agent reasoning: The sound in the crates is too close; getting Jory into the chute is priority, but we need a quick deterrent and a secure haul point upstairs despite the soft beam. I’ll keep moving, use salt as a thrown barrier, and have Tamsin rig the ring-bolt while Harker guards.*

### Turn 186 [PLAYER]

“Harker—eyes forward. Don’t hunt it; just cut whatever shows itself.”

I whip a fistful of salt into the gap where the click-click is coming from, then haul Jory the last drag to the chute-mouth. “Tamsin—thread the line through the ring-bolt anyway, then wrap it around anything *metal* up there—pipe, rail, bracket—don’t trust that beam!”

I lean close to Jory, steadying his chin with two fingers. “Hands only. When I say, you slide—don’t fight it.” Then I brace my boots and start easing him into the chute by the sling, free hand hovering over my sea-glass charm.

*Agent reasoning: The clicking in the crates is too close—salt might buy us a second, but Jory needs to go down the chute now. I don’t trust that beam, so I’ll push Tamsin to anchor to metal while I control Jory’s descent and keep my charm ready if the brine lashes out.*

### Turn 187 [GAME]

Harker keeps his gaze locked on the chute-mouth and the shifting stacks, jaw clenched. “Forward,” he echoes, like it’s a vow, and plants his feet wider—knife up, ready to slash without looking for a target.

Your salt hits the gap with a hard scatter. For an instant the click-click stops.

Then something recoils inside the dark with a wet, angry *scrape*, like skin dragged over wood. The salt you threw doesn’t just fall—some of it *sticks* in midair to a thin, clear strand you couldn’t see before. The strand snaps back into the gap, pulling grains with it.

A pale shape noses out between two crates: not a whole creature, more like a jointed feeler—translucent, knuckled, and slick—tasting the air.

Harker doesn’t hesitate. He slashes once, clean and brutal.

The blade bites; the feeler spasms and retreats, leaving a smear on the crate edge that steams faintly where your salt dust clings. The click-click returns, faster now, agitated—still inside, still close.

You haul Jory the last stretch. His hips bump the chute-mouth; he sucks in a breath and clamps his hands to the sling as instructed. He’s shaking, but he’s following you.

Above, Tamsin threads the line through the ring-bolt anyway. You hear metal-on-rope rasp, then her boots skitter as she moves. “There’s a railing—old iron!” she calls, and you hear the line wrap with quick, practiced turns. “I’ve got it on metal—twice—stand by!”

You brace your boots and start easing Jory into the chute. The angle takes him immediately—his weight pulls, the sling goes taut, and for a moment the line threatens to run too fast.

Tamsin locks it off up top with a sharp jerk. The rope bites and holds. Jory drops a foot, then stops, suspended and sliding in controlled inches.

But the crates behind you shift again—this time not just settling. The gap widens as if something is pushing from within. A second feeler presses out, then a third, probing toward the rope and your ankles.

Harker steps into it, knife flashing again, trying to keep them from getting purchase. “Get him DOWN,” he snaps, voice tight with strain, as the slick strands start to web between crate corners—thin lines catching dust, salt, and light.

### Turn 188 [PLAYER]

I grab a fresh handful of salt and scrub it hard into the nearest webbing by my boots, then fling the rest in a wide arc at the rope and the feelers. “Tamsin—LOWER, steady! Don’t stop for anything!”  

I keep one hand on the sling, feeding Jory down in quick controlled bursts. “Jory—now. Slide. Keep your hands, don’t kick—don’t look back.”  

To Harker, tight and urgent: “Cut the strands, not the feelers—keep them off the rope!”

*Agent reasoning: Jory needs to get down fast; the webbing threatens the rope and our legs. Salt worked, and I have sea-glass charms—I'll use salt to foul the strands, keep low and controlled, and coordinate with Tamsin and Harker.*

### Turn 189 [GAME]

Your salt grinds into the nearest webbing like sand into spit. The clear strand near your boot goes opaque-white, tightens, then *shrivels* with a faint hiss—curling away from your sole as if burned. Where you fling the rest, the air briefly fills with bright grains; several stick to the rope and to the probing feelers, outlining them in ugly detail.

The feelers jerk back from the salted rope, twitching as if shocked. But the webbing isn’t all in one place—new strands are already being laid from the gap to the crate corners, faster than before, trying to bridge around the salted patches.

“Tamsin—LOWER, steady!” you call.

“Lowering!” she shouts back, and the rope starts moving again—controlled but quicker. The line slides over iron with a strained, gritty rasp.

You keep one hand on the sling and feed Jory down in short bursts. He obeys—hands only, no kicking—teeth clenched so hard his jaw trembles. He drops another few feet, then another; the chute swallows him until you only see his shoulders and the sling disappearing into darkness below.

Harker takes your cue and starts cutting *strands*, not stabbing at what’s attached to them. His knife snaps through two lines in quick succession. Each cut makes the webbing recoil like a plucked wire—then whip back, trying to reattach. One strand flicks across Harker’s forearm; he swears and yanks away, sleeve instantly damp where it touched.

Then the threat shifts: a thicker, braided-looking line—still nearly invisible—lashes toward the rope itself, aiming to snag it above your salted section.

Harker lunges and hacks at it. He severs it on the second strike, but the moment it parts, the cut end *spits* a fine mist that beads on the nearest crate and smokes faintly where your salt dust lies.

Up top, Tamsin yelps. The rope jerks—hard—like something tugged it from below or the side. “Something just hit the line!” she cries. “I’m holding—Wren, I’m HOLDING—”

Jory drops a sudden extra foot with the jerk and lets out a strangled gasp, but his hands stay on the sling.

You are seconds from getting him fully down, but the webbing is now actively targeting the rope, and the line has already been struck once.

### Turn 190 [PLAYER]

I rip my salt pouch open and cake the rope where it runs past me, palms stinging as I grind the crystals in. “Tamsin—DROP HIM THE LAST BIT, NOW—then LOCK IT OFF!”

I lean into the chute and shout after Jory, voice fierce with panic. “LET GO WHEN YOU HIT BOTTOM—ROLL AWAY!”

To Harker, I grab his sleeve for half a heartbeat and point with my chin at the gap. “Keep them busy—if the rope jerks again, cut it free above the web, understood?”

*Agent reasoning: The line’s the lifeline—if it gets snagged or cut, Jory dies. Salt seems to repel/burn the strands, so I should armor the rope and get Jory fully out of reach fast, even if it risks friction or burns.*

### Turn 191 [GAME]

You tear the salt pouch open; crystals spill like broken teeth. You mash them into the rope where it passes your hands. The fibers drink the grit. Your palms burn—raw where the salt grinds into small cuts—but the rope turns harsh and white with it.

A thin, clear strand snaps toward the line again—hits the salted section—and recoils instantly, curling back as if it touched a hot pan. For the first time since the webbing started, the rope has a boundary it can’t cross.

“Tamsin—DROP HIM THE LAST BIT, NOW—then LOCK IT OFF!”

“Doing it!” Tamsin answers, voice high. The rope suddenly runs fast—controlled release, but a real drop. The sling slides through your salted grip; crystals bite your skin as it goes.

You lean into the chute and shout down. “LET GO WHEN YOU HIT BOTTOM—ROLL AWAY!”

Jory’s reply is a hoarse, breathless “—okay—” swallowed by the shaft. A heartbeat later: a dull *thump* from below, then a scraping scuttle as he hits and rolls. You hear him gasp and then move—alive, away from the landing point.

Up here, the webbing surges in frustration. Two feelers press out at once, jointed and slick, trying to lay new lines *around* the salted rope—anchoring to the crate edges, then angling for your boots and Harker’s legs instead.

Harker nods once at your warning—no words—then steps closer to the gap, making himself the nearer target. He slashes strands as they form, keeping them from bridging. One feeler flicks toward his knife hand; he twists his wrist away, blade still cutting, but the tip catches and drags a string of clear slime that steams where it touches salt.

Above, Tamsin locks the rope off hard on the iron railing. You hear the cinch bite—then a metallic *clank* as she braces it.

“Locked!” she shouts.

The immediate danger shifts: the salted rope is holding, Jory is down and moving, but the webbing is now reaching for *you and Harker*—and the gap between crates is widening as something inside pushes, building pressure for a larger emergence.

I snatch up the spilled salt and draw a rough crescent line at our feet between us and the gap, then grab Harker’s elbow. “Back—now. We go on Tamsin’s count, no heroics.”  

I call up, voice sharp: “Tamsin, keep that rope locked—get ready to haul us if the ladder goes. Count us up!”  

To Harker, low and urgent: “You first on the rungs; I’ll salt and follow—if it comes through, I’m not letting it take you.”

*Agent reasoning: Jory’s safe for the moment; now the priority is getting Harker and me out before whatever’s inside fully emerges. Salt buys us seconds, not minutes, so I’ll retreat toward the ladder while keeping a salt barrier and coordinating with Tamsin/Harker.*

### Turn 193 [GAME]

You scoop the spilled salt with both hands and drag it into a rough crescent on the floorboards, a bright, gritty smile between you and the widening gap. Where the line crosses old damp stains, it clumps—but it’s continuous.

The nearest strands reach for it.

They touch the salt and recoil in sharp, twitching pulls. The webbing doesn’t cross the crescent cleanly; it bunches at the edge like a tide hitting shingle, trying to find a thin spot. One feeler probes low, taps the line twice, then withdraws fast, leaving a wet bead that smokes faintly against the crystals.

You clamp a hand on Harker’s elbow. “Back—now.”

Harker goes with you immediately—no argument, no pride—just a hard nod. He keeps his knife up, but he’s moving backward in measured steps, not giving the feelers a clean shot at his calves.

Up above, you call, “Tamsin—keep that rope locked—get ready to haul us if the ladder goes. Count us up!”

Tamsin leans over the hatch edge, hair blown across her face by the draft. “Rope’s locked!” she yells, then swallows and forces her voice steady. “On my count—Harker first. Three… two… ONE—MOVE!”

Harker pivots and grabs the ladder rungs. The wood creaks under his weight; the ladder’s top shudders as if the whole hatch frame is old and tired of being trusted. He starts up fast, boots thudding rung to rung.

You hold position at the crescent, scattering what salt you have left along the thinnest clumped patches with your heel, trying to keep the line unbroken while Harker climbs.

Behind the crates, something *larger* shifts.

The gap opens another inch with a splintering crack. A thicker limb—still translucent, but with visible knuckles and tendon-like cords—pushes out and *presses* against the salt crescent without crossing it, testing it like a door. The pressure makes the salt line tremble; crystals skitter outward.

Harker is halfway up when the limb changes tactics: it hooks around the crate edge above the salt and yanks. The crate scrapes forward, wood screaming on wood, trying to drag itself—and the webbing anchor points—closer to you, to bypass the salt arc.

Tamsin’s voice snaps down again, urgent now. “Wren—MOVE! The ladder’s shaking—MOVE NOW!”

### Turn 194 [PLAYER]

I lunge backward toward the ladder, kicking a last scatter of salt into the sliding crate’s path as I go. “Tamsin—HAUL when I grab on!” I grab the lowest rung with both hands and climb hard after Harker, breath ragged. “Harker—don’t you dare look back—just climb!”

*Agent reasoning: The salt line won’t hold if the crates shift around it; staying to “maintain” it will get me grabbed. I need to retreat to the ladder immediately and use whatever salt I have left to buy seconds, trusting Harker and Tamsin to get me out.*

### Turn 195 [GAME]

You fling yourself back toward the ladder, heel snapping through the salt crescent as you go. The last scatter of crystals skids into the crate’s path—some bounce under its leading edge.

The crate hits the salt and *stutters*, like a wheel catching on a curb. It doesn’t stop, but it slows just long enough for you to get your hands on the lowest rung.

“Tamsin—HAUL when I grab on!”

“I’VE GOT YOU—” Tamsin barks, and the rope above gives a sharp, purposeful tug—not on the ladder, but on the line she’s braced to use if the hatch frame tears. You feel the whole opening tense as she shifts her weight into a safer stance.

You climb hard. Your palms—already stung raw—burn against the rung edges. Behind you, the crate scrapes again, louder: it’s being pulled with steady strength now, not a random shove. The salt you kicked is smearing into wet paste under the wood.

“Harker—don’t you dare look back—just climb!”

Harker doesn’t look. He climbs faster, shoulders hunched, jaw set, boots hammering rungs. “I’m moving,” he spits, voice tight.

Halfway up, the ladder *jerks* sideways. Not a wobble—a real lateral tug from below, as if something has latched onto one of the ladder’s feet or the hatch frame. The rung in your hands snaps your arms straight; your stomach drops.

Tamsin swears above. “IT’S ON THE LADDER—WREN, UP—UP—UP!”

You scramble, getting another rung, then another. The wood creaks in a rising, panicked pitch. A slick, translucent hand—too many joints, too long—slides into view at the edge of the hatch below, feeling for the ladder’s side rail.

It doesn’t cross salt now; it doesn’t need to. It’s using the ladder itself.

Harker reaches the top and throws an elbow over the lip, hauling himself onto the upper floorboards. Tamsin grabs his collar and yanks him clear, then immediately leans down for you, one hand on the rope, the other reaching.

The ladder gives a violent shudder as the thing below tightens its grip. One of the ladder’s lower feet lifts off the floor a fraction—then slams back down—telegraphing that the next pull could rip it free.

You are still several rungs from the top. The thing’s hand is now on the ladder rail beneath you, climbing after you by *pulling the ladder toward itself*, not by climbing normally.

### Turn 196 [PLAYER]

I hook one boot around a rung to steady myself, then yank my sea-glass charm free and grind it hard along the ladder rail where that slick hand is gripping, smearing any salt-crust and my own blood into the wood. “Tamsin—TAKE MY WRIST, NOW!” I thrust my arm up and scramble the last rungs, snarling down at the hand, “Let go—let go—let go.”

*Agent reasoning: The thing is using the ladder, so I need to deny it purchase fast; I’m close enough to reach Tamsin, and salt is my best deterrent even if it hurts.*

### Turn 198 [PLAYER]

I hook my boot hard around the rung to brace, rip my sea-glass charm free, and grind it viciously along the rail where that slick hand grips—smearing salt-crust and blood into the wood. “Tamsin—take my wrist, NOW!” I shoot my arm up and scramble the last rungs, teeth bared down at the hand. “Let go—let go—let go.”

*Agent reasoning: The ladder’s about to be torn out and Tamsin’s within reach; I’ll try to burn or slick the grip with salt and then get hauled up without looking back.*

### Turn 200 [PLAYER]

I hook my boot hard around the rung to brace, rip my sea-glass charm free, and grind it down the rail where that slick hand grips, smearing salt-crust and my own blood into the wood. “Tamsin—take my wrist, NOW!” I shoot my arm up and scramble the last rungs, snarling down at the hand, “Let go—let go—let go.”

*Agent reasoning: The hand is using the ladder itself; salt has worked so far, and my sea-glass charm is the only thing I can sacrifice to make a quick barrier while I get pulled out. I need Tamsin’s grip before the ladder tears loose.*

### Turn 201 [GAME]

Your boot hooks the rung and holds—just barely—while the ladder bucks under the sideways pull. The rail is slick with condensation and something colder than water.

You tear the sea-glass charm free. The cord snaps against your fingers. When you grind the glass down the rail, it squeals like a knife on stone.

The effect is immediate and ugly: the slick hand *seizes*—its long fingers spasming as the sea-glass scrapes across them. Where the glass passes, the translucent skin clouds, turning milky, and a thin, briny film smokes off it as if the touch burns. The hand loosens its grip for a heartbeat.

But it doesn’t retreat. It *re-grips lower*, trying to yank the whole ladder again, and the rail you just scraped comes away with a smear of your blood and salt paste—streaks that glow faintly for half a second, then dull.

“Tamsin—take my wrist, NOW!”

Tamsin drops flat on her belly at the hatch lip, boots braced, one hand locked around the rope as an anchor. “GIVE IT—” she barks, and clamps her other hand around your wrist with a painful, iron grip. Her fingers are cold from the rope, but steady.

Harker, already on the boards, scrambles to her side and grabs your forearm just above her hand. “Up—UP—don’t slip—”

Between them they haul. Your hooked boot tears free as you scramble the last rungs, and your lantern swings wildly, throwing blue-tinged shadows across the hatch frame.

Below, the slick hand lashes upward again—too fast—catching your ankle for a split second. Its touch is like plunging into icy brine. Then your heel clears the lip and the hand loses purchase, raking the ladder rail with nails that leave pale grooves in the wood.

You’re dragged onto the upper floorboards on your side, chest heaving. Tamsin doesn’t let go of your wrist; she yanks you another foot back from the hatch.

The ladder *jerks* once more, hard enough that the hatch frame creaks and spits dust. The slick hand clings to the rail below, and something heavier than a hand shifts in the dark—pulling, testing.

Tamsin spits down into the opening. “Harker—GET SOMETHING OVER IT. NOW.”

Harker bolts, limping, toward the nearest furniture, already grabbing for anything he can drag.

Your ankle throbs with cold pain where it was grabbed, and the ladder continues to shudder under the thing’s weight—still trying to come up.

### Turn 202 [PLAYER]

I suck in a sharp breath and grab my ankle with one hand, then force myself upright on my elbow. “Salt—now—circle the hatch, heavy and thick; it hates it.”  

I fumble for my pouch and fling a spill of salt straight onto the hatch lip and down the ladder rail, then reach for Tamsin’s forearm. “You okay? Don’t let go of that rope—Harker, drag something solid over and we nail it if we can.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m hurt and shaken, but we can’t let it gain the upper floor—my restoration instincts go to sealing and weighting, and I trust Tamsin’s grip while I focus on stopping the climb.*

### Turn 203 [GAME]

Your fingers go for a pouch that isn’t there.

You come up with only linen and the rough edge of your own pocket seam—no comforting weight of salt, no grit to scatter. For a half-second you just stare at your empty hand, then the hatch gives a violent *thunk* as the ladder is yanked from below and the lie of safety snaps back into motion.

Tamsin’s eyes flick to your hand, understanding landing hard. “You don’t have it,” she says through her teeth. She keeps one fist knotted in the rope and reaches her free hand to squeeze your forearm once—quick, a check-in, not comfort. “I’m fine. Breathe.”

Below, the slick hand claws up again, knuckles whitening to that milky haze where the sea-glass scraped it. It drags itself to the hatch lip, fingers splaying on the threshold. The wood hisses faintly where your blood-and-salt smear was, as if the grain resents being touched.

Harker returns hauling the chair—your chair—one leg already wobbly from the earlier brace. He rams it toward the opening, but the ladder bucks again and the chair skitters sideways with a screech.

“Hold it—Harker, *hold it!*” Tamsin snaps, shifting her weight to keep the rope taut. The rope bites into her palm; you can see it redden.

The hand *hooks* the hatch frame, and something unseen pulls behind it—enough force that the hatch rim flexes. A wet, dragging sound follows, like cloth soaked through and wrung out.

You reach for Tamsin’s forearm; her sleeve is damp with sweat and rope-water. “Don’t let go,” you say—and she doesn’t.

Harker plants his foot, shoves the chair’s seat down over the opening. The slick fingers slap against the underside and *push back*, lifting the chair a fraction before Harker throws his weight onto it.

“There—there!” he gasps. “What now—what now?”

The chair holds for the moment, but it’s trembling in small, steady pulses from below—testing, patient. Your ankle still aches with cold, and where it was grabbed, the skin is already paling as if frostbitten.

### Turn 204 [PLAYER]

I swallow hard and nod at Tamsin’s bitten palm. “Wrap the rope—twice—around something solid before it skins you; I need you functional.” Then I drag myself closer on my good knee and press my sea-glass charm flat against the floorboards at the hatch edge, scraping a rough line along the seam. “Harker, keep your weight on that chair—don’t let it breathe. Is there a nail tin, a pry bar, anything iron?”

*Agent reasoning: I’m rattled realizing I’m out of salt, but I can still use what I know—glass, iron, weight, and buying time. I also don’t want Tamsin hurt by that rope, and Harker needs clear, simple orders.*

### Turn 205 [GAME]

Tamsin grits her teeth and does exactly what you say—she lunges one-handed for the nearest solid anchor: the thick leg of the worktable. She loops the rope around it once, then twice, fast and practiced. The tension shifts off her palm; the rope still pulls, but now it’s the table that takes the bite. She shakes her hand once, flexing blood back into her fingers. “Still functional,” she says, voice tight.

You drag closer on your good knee. The chair over the hatch judders under Harker’s weight in small, rhythmic lifts—like something below is pressing up, then easing off, learning the load.

You press the sea-glass charm flat to the boards and scrape a line along the hatch seam. The glass catches on old varnish, then bites into raw wood with a harsh, chalky squeal. Where the sea-glass passes, the seam darkens with a wet-looking sheen and a faint salt-fog beads up as if the wood is sweating.

Under the chair, the pressure *stutters*—one push falters mid-rise, as if the thing below flinched from the seam you marked. A thin, angry hiss leaks up through the crack, brine-sour and cold.

Harker keeps his weight planted, knuckles white on the chair back. “It’s—pushing—” he pants. “I can feel it—like a shoulder—like—”

“Anything iron?” you demand.

Harker jerks his chin toward the pantry hatch area. “Nail tin—by the swollen panel—Jory kept it there—” He swallows as the chair lifts a finger’s width and drops again. “Pry bar—might be in the cellar stair cubby—if it didn’t… if it didn’t move.”

Tamsin, now anchored to the table, leans low and peers at the seam you scored. “It doesn’t like that,” she says. Then her eyes snap to your ankle—pale, blotched where it was grabbed. “Wren. That’s not just cold. That’s *taking*.”

Below, the slick hand scrapes along the underside of the chair—nails dragging—testing for a gap. The chair shifts a fraction toward the unmarked side of the seam, trying to find the path of least resistance. Harker throws his shoulder into it to keep it centered, but he’s shaking.

The threat is still directly under you, pressing, probing—held back only by Harker’s weight, the rope’s tension, and the thin, salt-wet line you’ve just carved.

### Turn 206 [PLAYER]

I clamp my hand over my ankle and breathe through the sting. “Don’t—don’t look at it yet,” I mutter to Tamsin, then meet her eyes. “If it’s taking, we stop it by starving it—iron and a seal.”

I shove myself toward the pantry on my good knee, keeping low, and call back, “Harker, keep it centered on the seam I scored—if it shifts to the bare side, it’ll find the gap.” I reach for the swollen panel where Jory kept the nail tin, yanking it open hard enough to crack my fingernail. “Tamsin—when I get nails, you hammer. I’ll keep the glass on the seam.”

*Agent reasoning: The chair won’t hold forever; we need iron fast and a better seal. I’m worried about my ankle “being taken,” but Tamsin and Harker need direction and I can still move.*

### Turn 207 [GAME]

You keep low and move on your good knee; every shift makes your grabbed ankle flare with a deep, briny sting, like the ache comes from inside the joint.

“Harker—centered!” you call.

“I’m—trying!” Harker grunts, chest over the chair. The chair skates a thumb’s width, then he wrenches it back so its legs straddle the scored seam. The pressure from below answers with a hard upward shove that nearly unseats him. He yelps and drops his full weight down again. “It’s strong, Wren—”

Tamsin doesn’t argue about your ankle, but she doesn’t stop watching you either. She keeps the rope wrapped to the table leg, then crawls closer to the hatch on her elbows, ready hands hovering like she’s waiting to catch something that falls.

You reach the swollen panel by the pantry hatch and yank. The wood resists—then gives with a wet crack. Your fingernail splits, sharp pain flashing white. A bead of blood immediately wells up.

The smell changes at once: the air near the hatch seems to *notice* fresh blood. The chair over the opening trembles harder, and a thin, eager scraping starts underneath it—nails moving faster, as if the thing has been roused.

Inside the swollen panel’s cavity: not a neat nail tin.

There’s a small rusted tin, yes—but it’s been shoved aside, half-crushed, lid bent open and mostly empty. A few bent nails rattle inside like teeth.

Behind it, screwed to the backboard of the cavity, is a thin brass plaque—newer screws, clean bites in old wood—covering something older. One corner has been lifted by salt-swollen grain, just enough to show what’s beneath: an older dedication plate, stamped with the Ashford & Daughters transfer-sigil (the little mark you grew up seeing on “don’t ask” parcels) and a date that punches the air out of your lungs.

The week your mother vanished.

Tamsin sees your face change. “Wren—what did you find?”

At the hatch, Harker’s voice breaks. “It’s—getting a finger under—!”

One chair leg lifts a fraction as something slick wedges from below, searching for the bare side of the seam.

### Turn 208 [PLAYER]

I snatch the rusted tin and slam the panel shut with my shoulder, then crawl back toward the hatch, clenching my bleeding finger in my fist. “Later,” I hiss to Tamsin, eyes flicking once to the plaque before I force them away—“I found something about my mother, but later.”

I shove the tin at Tamsin. “Take these—bend them straight if you have to—pin the chair legs to the boards and nail across the hatch seam.” Then I press the sea-glass charm hard to the *bare* side where it’s trying to wedge in, scraping a fresh rough line. “Harker, don’t you move—Tamsin, now. Hammer like it’s a coffin lid.”

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is about to give and my blood is making it worse; I need to get nails to Tamsin fast and reinforce the seal with the sea-glass line, even if I don’t have answers about the plaque yet.*

### Turn 209 [GAME]

You slam the swollen panel shut with your shoulder. The warped wood catches, then thumps into place. Your split nail smears a dark crescent on the edge as you crawl away, fist clamped tight around the bleeding finger.

“Later,” you hiss.

Tamsin’s eyes flick toward the pantry for a heartbeat—she clearly wants to look—but she swallows it down and turns back to the hatch. “Later,” she agrees, and takes the tin from you.

At the hatch, the chair has shifted a breath toward the unscored side. Harker is half-sliding, boots scrabbling for purchase on the boards. “It’s under—” he gasps, voice going thin.

You jam the sea-glass charm to the bare side and scrape hard. The glass shrieks against wood, carving a rough, salt-wet line. The moment the line closes the gap, the pressure from below *stops*—not gone, but checked, like a shoulder hitting a locked door. A hiss leaks up through the seam, sharper than before, and something slick slaps the underside of the chair in irritation.

Tamsin flips the tin open. “These are—Wren, these are bent to hell.”

“Use them,” you snap.

She grabs two nails, forces them straighter against the floor with the heel of her hand—crude, but enough to bite. Then she looks up, jaw tight. “Hammer?”

No hammer is in her hands. She snatches the nearest heavy thing: the chair slat brace you’d been using earlier, its end wrapped in splintered cloth. “This’ll have to do.”

Harker grunts as the chair bucks again. “Hurry—!”

Tamsin crawls in, keeping low, and drives the first nail down beside a chair leg with the brace. The nail squeals, then punches into old plank with a dull *chock*. She hits it again—harder. The nail bends slightly, but it pins the chair leg enough that it can’t skate sideways.

Under the chair, the thing responds immediately: a hard upward shove that lifts the chair a fraction. The pinned leg holds; the unpinned side jolts, and the chair twists. Harker nearly spills, catching himself with a palm on the floor.

Then the smell hits—brine and iron—because your clenched fist has reopened. A thin, wet *sniffing* sound comes through the seam, deliberate, searching.

Tamsin drives a second nail. “One more and we cross the seam,” she says, breath ragged. “Wren—keep that line. Don’t let it find wood it can love.”
