### Turn 4 [PLAYER]

Evelyn “Eve” Marlowe grew up in a dockside tenement and learned early that survival in this city comes with a price. Now she works as a nightclub chanteuse and occasional courier for a bootlegging crew, trading secrets for safety under the jaundiced glow of backroom deals. Guarded, razor-witted, and quietly tender beneath the armor, she can’t stop orbiting the married detective who keeps trying—and failing—to save her. Her goal is to buy her brother out of a gang debt and disappear, even if it means betraying the only man she’s ever loved.

*Agent reasoning: Generated roleplayer-style character for Noir historical romance, dramatic, forbidden love*

### Turn 5 [GAME]

Here's your character:

**Evelyn "Eve" Marlowe**
*Nightclub chanteuse and occasional courier for a bootlegging crew*

Raised in a dockside tenement during Prohibition, Eve learned to read people faster than she could read books, and to treat every favor as a debt waiting to be collected. A stint as a factory girl ended after a foreman’s “attention” and a blacklisted reference pushed her into the nightlife circuit. Now she lives between the velvet-lit stage and the city’s soot-stained alleys, carrying other people’s secrets while trying to keep her own heart from ruining her.

**Traits:** razor-witted, guarded, resourceful, quietly tender, morally flexible
**Goal:** Pay off her younger brother’s gang debt and vanish under a new name, even if it means selling out the bootlegging crew—and betraying the married detective she loves.

### Turn 9 [GAME]

Rain ticks the skylights of **the Velvet Lark** like impatient fingers. It’s **late night**, the hour when the docks go quiet and the streets get loud. Neon from the sign bleeds through the front curtains, and the air behind the stage smells of powder, sweat, and spilled gin. Outside, a siren starts and dies.

You sit at your dressing table with one shoe off, garter loosened, working the stocking down your calf as if you’re only fixing a snag. The mirror bulbs buzz. Your stage lipstick is still perfect, but your hands are steady in the way they were in the tenement—steady because shaking never bought you mercy. The torn **ledger page** stays flat against your skin until you slide it into your palm and read the columns again: dates, amounts, names you’ve heard men whisper about.

A knock comes—two quick taps, one slow—then the door opens without waiting. It’s **Lena**, the cigarette girl, cheeks flushed from running. She doesn’t look at your face; she looks at your hands. “Halden,” she says, and pushes a matchbook onto your table like it’s a tip. Inside, in tight pencil: **RAID. VICE BUREAU. TEN MINUTES. GET OUT. DON’T LET THEM TAKE YOU.** Under it, another line: **They asked about you by name.**

Before you can move, a man you’ve never seen steps into the doorway behind Lena as if he belongs there. Clean coat, no club stamp on his wrist, and a pale key-pin on his lapel—the same marrow-white symbol that marks your page. He sets a small case on the chair and says, calm as a banker, “New papers. New name. One delivery to a chalk-marked basement on Harker Street. Tonight.”

The hallway fills with footsteps and the distant bark of a whistle. You have the page, the warning, and the case in the same room, and every option has a price.

### Turn 10 [PLAYER]

I slide the ledger page back against my skin and stand, slipping my shoe on. “You’ve got brass in the hall and you picked now to go selling miracles?” I tilt my chin at the pale pin. “Who sent you—and what’s in that case that’s worth my neck?”

*Agent reasoning: A raid means I can’t linger, and this stranger with the key-pin reeks of leverage; I need a way out and a name to hang this on, but I can’t tip my whole hand yet.*

### Turn 11 [GAME]

The ledger page disappears back under the stocking against your thigh; the fabric catches for half a second on the torn edge, then lies flat. You get your shoe on just as the hallway noise sharpens—boots, a man’s laugh that doesn’t belong to the Lark, and the metallic jingle of a nightstick against a belt buckle.

The man with the pale key doesn’t flinch. He closes the dressing-room door with two fingers, not latching it—just enough to muffle the hall. Then he takes a step in, keeping his hands where you can see them.

“Miracles don’t come cheap,” he says. His voice is educated, careful about it. “I’m not Vice. I’m not Saints. I’m sent by Mr. Ketteridge’s office.” The name lands like a calling card—Marrow Society money, the kind that buys judges and riverfront blocks.

He nods at the key-pin when you tilt your chin. “That pin is my receipt. It means if I’m found in pieces, someone important asks why.”

“What’s in the case?” you press.

He doesn’t open it. He taps the lid once. “Documents. A birth certificate that doesn’t exist yet, a work card that already has stamps, and a letter of employment with a real company that will swear you’ve been on payroll for six months. Enough to walk through a station house without anyone deciding you’re worth holding.” His eyes flick briefly to your bare thigh before he looks away, like he’s marking where you keep things. “And something else. Sealed. Not for me.”

Lena shifts near the mirror, wringing her hands. “Eve—” she starts, but a hard rap hits the outer door to the backstage corridor, not yours—someone checking rooms.

A male voice barks down the hall: “Vice Bureau—everybody out front! Dressing rooms next!”

The Marrow man lowers his voice. “Harker Street. Basement door with fresh chalk marks—surveyors’ marks. You take the case there. You hand it through. You don’t look inside the sealed packet if you value your eyes.”

Another set of footsteps—closer now—stops right outside your dressing-room door. A shadow cuts under it.

The knob turns once, testing.

### Turn 12 [PLAYER]

I snatch the case and shove it into Lena’s arms for half a breath. “Powder room—now. If anyone asks, you never saw me.” Then I pull her back, take the case again, and hiss to the Marrow man, “Is Detective Halden in on this raid, or is he about to get himself killed trying to play hero?” 

I kill the mirror bulbs, slip to the far wall, and crack the stage-side panel open just enough to squeeze through. “If you want me alive, you’re coming first and you’re quiet.”

*Agent reasoning: Vice is seconds away; I need an exit that doesn’t put Lena in the line of fire. I’ll take the case for now—papers mean leverage—and use the stage/trap or service route, but I want to know if the detective is part of this raid.*

### Turn 13 [GAME]

The case is heavier than it looks—more like paperwork wrapped around something dense. When you shove it into Lena’s arms, she staggers a half-step, eyes wide. She nods hard at “powder room,” but she doesn’t move yet—frozen by the sound of the knob testing again.

You take the case back. The Marrow man watches your hands like he’s counting seconds.

You snap the mirror bulbs off. The room drops into a dim gray, lit only by spill from the hallway. The stage-side panel—an old service hatch in the far wall—gives with a soft crack of dry wood as you ease it open. Cold air and the faint throb of sax and crowd noise seep through.

In the hallway, a fist hits your door—once, impatient.

“Open up,” a man says, close enough that you can hear his breath. “Vice Bureau.”

You hiss at the Marrow man about Halden. He answers without heat, low and quick: “Halden isn’t running this. If he shows his face tonight, it’s to look useful—or to keep a certain file from walking. He’s in danger either way.”

He moves when you order him—quiet, but not graceful. His shoe scuffs the floorboard, a small sound that nonetheless seems enormous in the dark.

The knob turns again, harder this time.

“Last chance,” the voice says.

You slip through the panel first, shoulder scraping the frame. The space beyond is a narrow service run behind the stage flats—painted canvas, ropes, and dust. You can see through a slit between curtains: the club floor is still full, but the mood has shifted—heads turning toward the front, people standing too fast.

Behind you, the Marrow man squeezes for the hatch—

—and at that exact moment the dressing-room door latch snaps with a sharp crack. The door swings inward, flooding the room with hallway light.

A Vice Bureau officer fills the doorway, hat brim low, baton in hand. He takes in the dead bulbs, the open hatch, and Lena by the mirror like she’s been caught mid-prayer.

“There,” he says, and points straight at the panel. “They’re going out the back.”

Boots start running.

You are in the service run with the case. The Marrow man is halfway through the hatch, stuck for a breath as he drags a shoulder free. Lena is still inside the dressing room with Vice staring her down.

```

### Turn 14 [PLAYER]

I lean back through the hatch just enough to be seen and snap, “She’s just the cigarette girl, you dumb ox—she don’t know a thing,” then I grab a fistful of powder from the table and fling it straight at the officer’s face. I yank the Marrow man fully through by his coat and hiss, “Move—now,” and tear down the service run toward the back exit, keeping low behind the flats.

*Agent reasoning: Lena’s about to take the fall because of me; I can’t leave her to Vice. I’ll buy her a second and then run—case in hand—before they flood the service run.*

### Turn 15 [GAME]

You lean back through the hatch into the dressing room light—just enough for the Vice man to see your face and hear you. “She’s just the cigarette girl—” you spit, and the officer’s eyes narrow, recognizing you the way Halden warned: by name, by description, by somebody’s money.

Your hand finds the powder dish by the mirror. You scoop a fistful and fling.

It hits him square across the eyes and nose. He jerks back with a strangled curse, baton clattering against the doorframe as he claws at his face. “God—!” He staggers, blinking hard, tears cutting white tracks through the powder.

Lena uses the half-second like she was born for it—she ducks under his arm and bolts into the hall, skirts up, moving fast and silent.

You hook your fingers in the Marrow man’s coat and haul. He comes through the hatch with a grunt, shoulder scraping wood, and lands wrong on one knee in the service run. He’s up again immediately, teeth clenched, the key-pin catching a sliver of stage light.

Behind you, the officer barks, half-blind: “BACKSTAGE! NOW! SHE’S HERE—EVE MARLOWE!”

Boots answer—two, then three sets—pounding toward the dressing rooms.

You tear down the service run, keeping low behind the flats. Canvas brushes your cheek. A rope swings and taps your shoulder as you pass. The sax on stage keeps wailing, but the crowd noise changes—screams now, chairs scraping, a shouted “Police!”

Ahead: the back exit door at the end of the run—painted black, with a push bar—and a thin line of rain-lit alley seeping under it.

Then a stagehand you don’t recognize steps out from between two flats like he was waiting there, palms up as if to calm you. Saints haircut. Saints eyes. He holds a short iron bar low at his thigh.

“Evenin’, songbird,” he says. “Boss wants his paper back.”

Behind you, the service run fills with the hard clap of running boots and a voice shouting, “STOP!”

You have the Saints man blocking the back exit ten feet ahead, Vice closing from behind, and the Marrow courier at your shoulder trying not to breathe too loud.

### Turn 16 [PLAYER]

I lift the case like I’m offering it and call low, “Tell your boss the paper’s already burned—this is what replaced it,” then I whip the case hard into his chest to buy a heartbeat and shoulder past on his bar side. “Eddie—move!” I snap at the Marrow man, shoving him for the door as I slam the push bar and spill us into the rain-lit alley.

*Agent reasoning: I’m pinned—if I hesitate, Vice catches me; if I fight, I’ll lose time. Saints like leverage, so I’ll bargain with a lie and use the stage chaos to slip past, even if it’s messy.*

### Turn 17 [GAME]

You lift the Marrow case like an offering. The Saints man’s eyes flick to it—greedy, automatic—his iron bar rising a couple inches as he shifts his weight to take or smash, you can’t tell which.

“Tell your boss the paper’s already burned—this is what replaced it,” you murmur.

Then you whip the case into his chest.

It lands with a dull, solid thud—more resistance than folders should have. He grunts, air punched out, boots skidding on dusty boards. The iron bar comes up late, clipping your shoulder as you shoulder past on his bar side. Pain flashes hot down your arm, but nothing breaks; it’s a glancing hit meant to stop you, not kill you.

“Eddie—move!” you snap.

The Marrow courier lunges for the door when you shove him. He fumbles the push bar with both hands like he’s never used a stage exit in his life. It gives, and the door bangs outward.

Rain and alley light spill in. You both tumble out into the wet—cobblestones slick, garbage stink, fog hugging the brick. The door starts to swing back on its spring.

Behind you, the Saints man recovers fast, wheezing. “She’s got the Society box!” he barks, and he’s already reaching inside his coat.

Inside the club, boots hit the service run. A Vice voice shouts, “ALLEY! CUT ‘EM OFF!”

In the alley, a black sedan is idling half a block down with its lamps off—engine ticking soft. The passenger door is already cracked open, like someone expected you. A silhouette inside turns its head toward you.

The Marrow man—Eddie, apparently—grabs your elbow with a sharp, desperate grip. “Not that car,” he hisses, eyes fixed on it. “That’s not ours.”

The backstage door slams open behind you. The Vice officer you blinded bursts out, face smeared white, pistol in hand, blinking through tears.

“You!” he yells, and raises the gun.

The Saints man steps into the doorway behind him with his iron bar—and something small and dark in his other hand now.

You are in the alley in the rain, with Vice aiming, a Saints enforcer armed behind him, and an unknown sedan waiting ahead with an open door.

```json

```

### Turn 18 [PLAYER]

I grab Eddie by the collar and yank him sideways into the deepest shadow by the brick, then I fling the Marrow case down hard to splash and skitter as a distraction. “HALDEN!” I shout into the rain like a prayer and a knife, and I bolt for the sedan’s open door—low, zig-zagging—ready to slam it shut or jump back out the second I see who’s inside.

*Agent reasoning: Eddie’s warning feels true, but a gun pointed at me means I need cover now; the sedan’s the only moving shield, and I can decide whether to get in after I’m not staring down a barrel.*

### Turn 19 [GAME]

You wrench Eddie by the collar and slam him into the brick’s deepest seam of shadow. He stumbles, catches himself, and stays there—hands up, breathing ragged, eyes tracking the gun.

You hurl the Marrow case into the alley.

It hits a puddle and *skips*—hard corners biting water—then skitters toward the middle of the cobbles with a heavy, ugly scrape. The lid pops a finger-width. Something inside flashes pale under the street spill: not papers—something smooth and bone-white.

The Vice officer’s attention snaps to it. “The box!” he barks, and his pistol dips for the fraction you needed.

“HALDEN!” you shout, loud enough to rake the windows.

A shape moves at the far end of the alley—someone behind a rain barrel flinches like they’ve been waiting for that name, but they don’t step out.

You bolt for the sedan, low and cutting side to side.

The Vice officer fires once. The shot cracks off the brick above you, showering grit; the ricochet whines past your ear. He fires again—this one punches into the sedan’s rear quarter with a metallic *thunk*, sparking.

The Saints enforcer in the doorway doesn’t swing the bar—he throws. The small dark thing in his hand arcs and clatters near the case: a compact baton-light or weighted sap, meant to draw eyes—then he lunges for the skittering case instead, greedy and fast.

You reach the sedan’s open door and catch it with your left hand.

Inside: not Halden. A man in a dark coat and driver’s cap, jaw tight, eyes sharp. Marrow Society key-pin on his lapel, but his hands are wrong—ink-stained, not soft. He levels a short pistol from the passenger seat straight at your ribs.

“Get in,” he says. “Now. Or you die in the alley.”

From behind you, Eddie hisses, “Eve—NO—” and the Vice officer is already re-aiming, stepping forward into the rain with murder in his face.

The sedan’s engine revs, ready to jump the moment weight hits the seat.

### Turn 20 [PLAYER]

I lift my hands like I’m surrendering and slide into the sedan fast—then I grab his pistol wrist with both hands and jam it up toward the roof. “Drive, you ink-fingered bastard—unless you want Vice shooting through your skull to get to me.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m cornered—Vice has a clear shot and Eddie’s warning feels real, but standing here gets me dead. I’ll buy half a second by playing compliant, then turn the gun line in my favor and keep my options open if Halden’s nearby.*

### Turn 21 [GAME]

You go in hands-up, fast—hips sliding across wet leather—then your fingers clamp his gun wrist and you ram it toward the roofline.

The pistol barks inside the car.

The shot punches a neat hole through the headliner and out through the roof with a ringing tear of metal. Powder-smoke blooms in the tight space, sharp and sour. The man grunts, surprised more than hurt, and his free hand slams into your shoulder to pin you back against the seat.

Outside, Vice sees the muzzle flash through the window and answers with instinct: two shots crack into the sedan’s body—one spiderwebs the rear side glass, spraying cubes across the seatback; the other pings off the door frame near your elbow. Tiny shards bite your cheek and forearm.

“Ink-fingered bastard—drive,” you snarl, shoving his wrist higher, forcing the barrel away from you.

He doesn’t fight you like a club bruiser. He twists with practiced economy, turning his forearm so your grip loses leverage, then he headbutts forward—hard. Your vision bursts white at the edges as his forehead clips your brow. Not a knockout, but enough to loosen your hands.

“Driver!” he snaps, voice flat. “MOVE.”

Up front, the driver—another man, broad shoulders under a slicker—drops the sedan into gear. Tires spin on wet cobbles, then catch. The car surges.

As it lurches, the passenger rips his gun arm free and shoves the pistol muzzle down between the seats toward you again, close enough you can smell oil on the metal.

“You’re in my car,” he says, teeth tight. “You do *exactly* what I say.”

The sedan fishtails past the skittered Marrow case. In the side mirror you catch it for an instant: the Saints enforcer scoops it up one-handed, ignoring the Vice officer’s shouted orders. Eddie is still plastered to the brick shadow, staring after you like you just jumped off a pier.

Vice fires again—one last shot that cracks the trunk lid as you pull away—then the alley folds into fog and speed.

You are in a moving sedan with two Marrow men: driver in front, armed passenger beside you with a pistol inches from your ribs. The Vice and Saints are behind, and Eddie is left in the alley.

### Turn 22 [PLAYER]

I wipe the blood off my brow with the back of my wrist, eyes locked on his. “Fine. Talk. Who are you—Marrow, Saints, or Halden’s pet?” I nod toward the rear window. “And if you’re smart, you tell your driver to lose the tail—because I’m not dying over a box I don’t even have anymore.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m outgunned and boxed in; if I fight now I’ll get shot. I need names, leverage, and a way to circle back for Eddie—or at least keep him alive.*

### Turn 23 [GAME]

You wipe the blood; it smears dark across your wrist. The passenger’s eyes don’t leave your face, but the pistol eases back an inch—still aimed, no longer kissing you.

“Not Saints,” he says. “Not Halden’s anything.” He taps the key-pin with the gun hand like it’s a badge. “Marrow. Field side.”

The driver takes a hard right without being told, tires hissing, the sedan’s rear end stepping out before it straightens. Water fans off the wheels. Streetlamps smear into long yellow lines across the wet glass.

“Lose the tail,” you say.

The passenger flicks two fingers toward the windshield. “Rook—river road.”

Rook doesn’t answer. He just drives like he’s angry at the city: another turn, tighter, then a sudden brake-and-go that snaps your shoulder against the seat. Through the rear window you catch headlights—one set—bouncing at the corner you just took. Not a police cruiser; too low, too quiet. The Vice boys are likely still back at the club, but someone is following.

The passenger’s mouth tightens when he sees it. “Saints,” he says, like he’s tasting something rotten. “They got the case. That means they’ll want the *page* next.”

He leans in, voice low. “You shouting Halden in the alley wasn’t prayer. It was a flare. Someone heard it.”

As if to underline it, a car horn blats ahead—short, coded. Rook answers with a single flash of the headlights, then cuts the lamps entirely. The sedan plunges into a darker stretch where the fog sits thicker and the buildings lean closer.

The passenger finally lowers the pistol to his thigh, but keeps it in hand. “Name’s Sable,” he says. “And you’re right about one thing: you’re not dying over a box.”

He looks you over—blood, glass, the set of your jaw. “You’re dying if the Saints realize you don’t have it and start asking what you *do* have.”

The follower’s headlights vanish for a moment in the fog—then reappear closer than they should be, gaining.

Rook takes the next turn too fast, aiming the sedan toward the river road’s slick, open stretch—nowhere to hide if the tail sticks.

No one in this car is pretending anymore: you’re in a Marrow sedan running dark, with a Saints car closing in behind you.

### Turn 24 [PLAYER]

I swallow the sting in my brow and lean closer, voice low. “Sable—listen. The Saints didn’t take *nothing* off me. They took the box because they think the page is with it… but the page isn’t in that case.”

I glance past him at Rook’s silhouette. “River road’s a shooting gallery. Tell your driver to cut into the dock service lanes by Pier Nine—there’s a chain gap by the fish sheds. We kill the lights, we swap direction, we let them overshoot into fog.”

Then I look Sable dead on. “And when we breathe again, you tell me what Marrow really wants with that page—because I’m not trading my skin for a secret I don’t even understand.”

*Agent reasoning: Sable’s playing hardball, but he’s also scared—Saints on our tail means we need leverage and a plan. I’ll offer information (the “page”) to buy cooperation, and push for a risky but plausible move: dump the tail near the river with a sudden stop-and-switch or a hard cut into a service lane I might know from dock runs.*

### Turn 25 [GAME]



### Turn 26 [PLAYER]

I grab Sable’s sleeve and jerk my chin toward the windshield. “Pier Nine—dock service lanes. Chain gap by the fish sheds. Tell Rook, now, or we’re targets on river road.”  
Then I lean in, eyes hard. “And after we shake them, you tell me what Marrow wants with that page—or I bail the first time this car slows.”

*Agent reasoning: The screen went blank like the Loom’s waiting on a choice; I’m not letting Sable steer my fate without answers, but I need his buy-in fast to survive the tail.*

### Turn 27 [GAME]

Your fingers bite into Sable’s sleeve. The fabric’s good wool—expensive—and under it there’s a hard band of muscle that doesn’t flinch.

Sable’s eyes flick to your hand, then to the rear window where the headlights swell and dip in the fog.

He makes a quick decision.

“Rook—Pier Nine. Service lanes. Fish sheds,” Sable snaps, and for the first time there’s heat in his voice. “Chain gap.”

Rook’s head tilts a fraction, like he’s checking a map only he can see. Then the sedan veers left, not toward the open river road but into the dock grid—narrower streets, stacked crates, black puddles, and the stink of brine and diesel. He kills the headlights without slowing. The world outside becomes silhouettes: gantry cranes like praying mantises, warehouse doors like shut mouths.

Behind you, the Saints’ car doesn’t follow the turn clean. Its headlights sweep past the intersection—overshooting—then brake lights flare red in the fog as it corrects.

“Now,” you hiss. “Swap direction.”

Rook doesn’t. Not yet.

He takes you deeper first—two quick turns that put you between fish sheds and a fenced service lane. Up ahead, the chain gap you remember is there… but it isn’t empty.

Two dock sentries stand by the break in the chain, cigarettes glowing. One lifts a hand, palm out, as the sedan rolls toward them dark. The other’s coat bulges at the hip—gun.

Rook brakes hard. The sedan noses down. Your stomach lurches.

Sable’s pistol comes up again, not at you—toward the windshield. “Don’t,” he warns, more to Rook than to you.

The sentry with the cigarette steps forward, squinting into the dark. “Who’s there?” he calls. “You’re not supposed to—”

Behind, the Saints’ headlights bloom at the far end of the lane, closer now, sweeping between sheds as they hunt the turn you made.

You’re boxed in: chain gap guarded ahead, Saints closing behind, and you’re sitting in a dark sedan with a Marrow gun raised.

Sable leans close enough that you can smell his breath—peppermint trying to cover fear. “Marrow wants the page because it proves the Vice Bureau’s pay list,” he says, clipped. “Names. Dates. Payments. It buys us the tunnel permits without a fight—or it buys us their silence.”

The sentry’s hand drops to his hip.

“Window,” Sable says to you, low and urgent. “Tell them you belong here, or this turns loud.”

### Turn 28 [PLAYER]

I roll the window down just a crack and lean into the dark, keeping my hands visible. “Easy—Evelyn Marlowe. I’m late and I’m not alone; Halden’s expecting me through the gap, now.”  
I flick my eyes to the bulge at the sentry’s hip. “You want a password, ask Halden why he owes the Marrow boys tunnel permits—otherwise step aside before the Saints’ headlights find all of us.”

*Agent reasoning: I’ve worked docks before and I can sell a lie fast; if these sentries stall us, the Saints will pin us. I’ll play like I’m expected, give them a name they’ll recognize, and keep it moving while Sable and Rook stay quiet and dangerous.*

### Turn 29 [GAME]

The window drops a finger’s width. Fog pours in, cold and fish-stinked.

The cigarette tip flares as the nearer sentry leans toward your sliver of glass. “Evelyn Marlowe,” he repeats, like he’s checking the name against something he already decided. His eyes flick past you, trying to make out shapes in the back seat.

At “Halden,” the second sentry—the one with the bulge—goes still. His hand doesn’t draw, but it settles on the grip under his coat. Not dock muscle. Trained.

“You don’t say ‘Halden’ out loud down here,” he says. Flat. “Not unless you want everyone to hear it.”

Your line about tunnel permits lands wrong—too sharp, too accurate. The cigarette sentry’s face tightens; he takes a half-step back from the car like he suddenly expects it to explode.

The armed sentry raises his chin toward the lane behind you. “Saints are already here,” he says, and there’s no sympathy in it. “So either you’re a fool… or you’re bait.”

Behind, the Saints’ headlights sweep the mouth of the service lane and pause—searching. You hear an engine idle, then the crunch of tires on gravel as their car creeps forward. A door opens. A man’s voice carries, low and amused: “Found you.”

The armed sentry makes a quick, ugly choice: he yanks the chain up and hooks it higher—opening the gap wider—but he doesn’t wave you through. He points, instead, at the narrow cut between two sheds on your right.

“Not through the main,” he says. “Cut between the fish sheds. There’s a back spur to Pier Nine. Go *now*.”

Then he steps into the lane and lifts his free hand toward the Saints’ lights like he’s about to play traffic cop, buying you seconds. The cigarette sentry moves with him, nervous, glancing at your sedan like he expects you to bolt.

Inside the car, Rook’s hands tighten on the wheel, waiting for the call. Sable’s pistol stays up, angled toward the windshield.

The threat is immediate and specific: the Saints are close enough that you can hear a door and a voice, and if you don’t move in the next heartbeat they’ll have a clear line into this lane—and into your dark sedan.

### Turn 30 [PLAYER]

“Rook—between the sheds, now!” I hiss, ducking low and planting a hand on the dash to steady myself. “Sable, keep that gun off me and on the lane—if they step in front, you scare ’em, you don’t singe my hair.”

*Agent reasoning: The sentry just gave us a narrow escape route and bought us seconds; if we hesitate, the Saints get a clear shot. I’ll push Rook to move, keep Sable focused forward, and brace for the squeeze-through.*

### Turn 31 [GAME]

Rook moves the instant you hiss it—hard right, wheel cranked. The sedan lurches off the lane and into the narrow cut between fish sheds where the ground turns to rutted muck and scattered ice. Your palm slaps the dash; the car bucks, suspension groaning, and a crate edge scrapes along the passenger side with a scream of wood on paint.

Sable shifts with the turn, not graceful—professional. His pistol tracks away from you and toward the rear window.

Behind, the Saints’ headlights catch the sentries in the lane. The armed sentry throws his arm up like he owns the road. “Hold it! Authorized—” he barks.

A Saints voice answers, closer than it should be: “Authorized by who?”

Then a shot cracks—sharp, flat. The armed sentry jerks and folds at the waist, dropping out of the headlights like a marionette with cut strings. The cigarette man stumbles back, hands up, and bolts toward the sheds.

Rook punches the gas. The sedan fishtails, tires spitting brine and gravel, and shoots down the gap. For a second you see the lane behind framed between shed walls: Saints silhouettes spilling forward, one man with a pistol up, another with a shotgun held low as he runs.

Sable fires once through the rear window—deafening in the tight car. The glass spiders and blows outward in a spray. His shot isn’t aimed to kill; it’s aimed to make them duck. One of the Saints drops behind a piling, the shotgun man flinching aside as pellets don’t come—just the threat.

But the Saints recover fast. A second later the shotgun barks anyway, not at you directly but into the shed wall—wood explodes into splinters that whip past the car like angry insects. A chunk of plank smashes the rear quarter panel with a dull thud.

Rook threads the sedan onto a back spur—narrow rails half-buried in mud—leading toward Pier Nine. Ahead, the fog thins just enough to show a squat warehouse with fresh chalk marks on its basement doorframe: surveyors’ lines, and beneath them a small, marrow-white key symbol.

The immediate threat: the Saints are in pursuit on foot with firearms and have line-of-fire down the shed cut; your rear window is gone and the car has taken a hit, but you’ve bought distance and reached the spur toward the marked basement door.

### Turn 32 [PLAYER]

“Rook—warehouse. Right up on that door, then kill it.” I duck low, eyes on the chalk key, and grab the handle. “Sable, you said tunnel permits—this better be the damn tunnel.”

As soon as we’re close enough, I shove the door open and slip out into the fog, one hand pressed to my brow. “Move—inside, now. And if that page buys silence, you’re gonna tell me whose names are on it once we’re breathing.”

*Agent reasoning: We need cover fast and that key mark screams Marrow hide or tunnel access; staying in the car with no rear window is asking to get stitched up. I’ll push them into the warehouse basement while keeping Sable focused on the threat and Rook ready to peel out.*

### Turn 33 [GAME]

Rook swings the sedan tight to the warehouse wall, bumper almost kissing the chalk-marked basement door. The engine cuts; the sudden quiet is worse than the gunshots—just fog drip and your own breath.

You shove your door open and slide out low. Cold air hits your face like a slap. Your hand goes to your brow and comes away wet—not blood, just rain and grit flung up by the sheds. The warehouse looms, brick sweating, the key symbol starkly white against the dark.

Sable gets out on your side fast, using the car as cover, pistol up. “Move,” he snaps—at you, at Rook, at the fog.

Rook comes around the rear, and you see the damage: the back window is a jagged mouth, and the rear quarter panel is peppered and dented.

You reach for the basement door handle.

It doesn’t budge.

There’s a fresh padlock on it—new brass, still too clean for dock air—threaded through the hasp. Someone expected this door to be used and decided to control who used it.

From the spur behind you: a shout, then the wet slap of running feet on mud and rail ties. Saints, closing—no longer just headlights and silhouettes. You catch a flicker of a flashlight beam between sheds, bouncing as it runs.

Sable swears under his breath and plants himself at the corner of the warehouse, pistol aimed down the spur. He doesn’t fire yet—he’s counting seconds, listening for how many sets of feet.

Rook grabs the padlock, yanks, tests it once. “Locked,” he says unnecessarily, voice tight. His eyes dart along the wall—looking for another way in.

Then the first Saints man appears at the mouth of the spur, fog parting around his shoulders. He’s close enough you can see the brim of his cap and the pale oval of his face. He raises his pistol and takes aim at the sedan, not at you—smart, trying to pin you behind it.

“Hands where I can see ’em!” he barks. “Step away from the door!”

A second beam snaps on, higher—another man, further back, sweeping the warehouse face like he’s looking for a different entrance.

You have a locked basement door marked with the Marrow key, Sable posted with a gun at the corner, Rook exposed at the lock, and at least two Saints with a pistol and a light taking control of the spur—close enough to shoot, close enough to rush.

### Turn 34 [PLAYER]

I lift my hands slow, stepping half a pace away from the door like I’m scared, but I keep my body between their line and Rook. “Easy, boys—nobody’s looking to die in the fog.”

Without turning my head, I hiss, “Rook—side window, fire escape, anything. Sable—don’t shoot unless they rush.” Then I call out, voice sharper, “You really wanna start a war over a padlock? Tell your man with the light to stop painting targets and come talk like he’s got a brain.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re pinned and the door’s locked—talking buys seconds while I look for another way in. I’ll bluff confidence, keep their eyes on me, and shove Rook toward a side entrance while Sable covers.*

### Turn 35 [GAME]

Your hands come up slow, palms out. You take that half-step away from the door—just enough to look compliant—while keeping your body between the Saints’ sightline and Rook’s hands at the lock.

It works, partly.

The lead Saints man keeps his pistol trained center-mass on you, but his voice drops a notch. “That’s right,” he says. “Stay pretty and still.”

The flashlight beam wavers, then lifts off your chest and crawls up the warehouse face instead—less of a target-paint, more of a search. The man holding it doesn’t come forward; he angles to the left, trying to get a better look down the wall and past the sedan. He’s not here to “talk,” he’s here to trap.

“War?” the lead man snorts. “This ain’t war, sweetheart. This is cleanup.”

Behind you, Rook takes the opening. He slides along the brick, keeping low, and finds a narrow, grime-caked window set at shoulder height—old basement glass with a rusted wire mesh. He tests it with his fingertips, then puts his shoulder into it.

The glass doesn’t shatter clean. It cracks with a sharp pop and holds for a heartbeat—then gives with a crunch. A slice of jagged pane drops inward, clinking against something metal inside.

That sound changes everything.

The flashlight man snaps the beam hard onto the window. “There!” he barks.

The lead Saints man’s pistol swings off you toward Rook. “Get away from that—”

Sable, true to your hissed order, doesn’t fire. But he shifts his stance at the corner, bringing his gun up into a ready two-handed grip, making it clear that if they shoot at Rook, there will be an answer.

The Saints don’t shoot yet. Instead, the lead man steps forward fast, trying to close the distance and physically take control before bullets start flying. You can see his free hand coming up—either to grab you and use you as a shield, or to shove you aside and rush the window.

Threat, immediate and specific: one Saints gunman is advancing to seize control at arm’s length while another keeps a light trained on Rook at the broken basement window; if the lead man gets hands on you or gets a clear shot line on Rook, gunfire is likely in the next second.

### Turn 36 [PLAYER]

I take one small step toward him like I’m about to plead, eyes wide—then I snap my knee up hard into his groin and shove him off-balance into the mud. “Rook—now! In!”

I dart sideways toward the broken window, grabbing a fist-sized chunk of brick or rubble from the ground and whipping it at the flashlight to kill the beam, then I duck low by the wall and hiss to Sable, “Cover us—don’t be a hero, just keep their heads down!”

*Agent reasoning: I can’t let him grab me or get a clean line on Rook; I’ll play soft for a beat, then go mean and close—hit him where it counts and use the moment to get us inside.*

### Turn 37 [GAME]

You step in like you’re going to beg.

The Saints gunman commits—weight forward, reaching.

Your knee comes up hard and clean. It lands with a dull, sick thump. His breath leaves him in a wet gasp and his pistol arm jerks wide as his body folds. You shove him and he goes down into the mud on one hip, then both knees, gagging—still conscious, still armed, but not coordinated.

“Son of a—” he chokes, trying to find his gun again.

You break sideways for the wall.

Your fingers find a fist-sized chunk of brick near a crumbled patch of mortar. You whip it at the light.

It hits the flashlight dead-on with a sharp *crack*—glass bursts, the beam dies instantly. The man holding it yelps and jerks his hand back, cursing, more surprised than hurt.

But the darkness doesn’t save you for long.

The flashlight man immediately draws his pistol with his other hand and fires a blind shot toward where the window noise came from. The round smacks into brick above you, spitting a spray of grit and a sharp sting across your cheek.

Sable answers your hiss the only way he can—by making them keep their heads down. He leans out from the warehouse corner and puts two shots downrange, controlled and low. Not to kill—close enough to make the flashlight man flinch back behind a piling and stop advancing.

Rook doesn’t waste the moment. He hooks his hands into the broken frame and hauls himself through the basement window, coat snagging on the wire mesh. The mesh bites; it tears with a metallic screech, and he drops inside with a heavy thud and a grunt.

From inside the warehouse comes a new sound: a hurried scrape of boots on concrete and the rattle of something bumped—like stacked crates or shelving.

Outside, the groin-shot Saints man is on all fours in the mud, trying to rise, pistol shaking in his hand. He’s furious now, face twisted, and he’s looking right at you along the wall.

Threat, immediate: one Saints gunman is regaining his feet at close range with a pistol and a clear angle on you by the wall; another is behind cover but armed and likely to push up now that the light is out; you have an open (but jagged) basement window as your only entry, and Rook is inside but not yet in a position to help you.

### Turn 38 [PLAYER]

I snatch up another chunk of grit and brick dust and fling it straight at his eyes, then lunge low and kick his gun hand sideways as I dive for the broken window. “Sable—keep ’em down!” I hiss, and haul myself through the frame, ignoring the bite of glass.

*Agent reasoning: He’s too close and angry to trust; if I hesitate he’ll put a round in me. I need to break his aim for one second and get through that window, and Sable can keep the other one pinned.*

### Turn 39 [GAME]

You scoop up a handful of wet grit and brick dust and snap it into his face.

He jerks back with a raw yelp, blinking hard, one hand flying up instinctively. For half a second his pistol dips and his stance loosens—enough.

You go low and drive your boot into his gun wrist, not trying to break it, just to spoil the shot. The pistol cracks once anyway—wild—slamming into the mud by your ankle with a wet *thunk* that sprays your stocking.

Then you’re already moving.

You dive for the broken basement window and haul yourself through. The frame bites immediately: a jagged tooth of glass drags across your forearm and then your ribs as you twist. It’s a hot, tearing sting. Blood slicks your skin in the cold air, and your sleeve starts to darken fast.

Inside, you drop hard onto concrete, shoulder-first, the breath knocked out of you.

Rook is a few yards in, crouched behind a stack of old shipping crates. He grabs your elbow and yanks you deeper into the basement’s shadow. “Jesus, Eve—move,” he hisses.

Outside, Sable fires again—two sharp reports—forcing the second Saints man to stay pinned behind cover. But you also hear more feet now, closer than before, and a shouted order: “AROUND—GET THE OTHER SIDE!”

The Saints you kneed is still outside, blinded and raging. He scrapes at his eyes and barks hoarsely, “She went in! Basement—window!”

The basement itself is unfinished and damp: low ceiling, brick walls sweating, and a narrow corridor running deeper under the warehouse. Along the far wall, half-hidden by crates, there’s a heavy interior door with fresh chalk markings like the one outside—survey lines and a crude key symbol. A thin line of light shows under it, like there’s a lit space beyond.

Immediate threat: Saints are moving to flank the warehouse exterior and will likely try to enter through the window after you; you’re bleeding from fresh cuts and inside an unfamiliar basement with one deeper door that looks recently used.

### Turn 40 [PLAYER]

I clamp a hand over my bleeding forearm, jaw tight. “Rook—get that door. If it’s the tunnel, we’re taking it.”  

Then I crawl back toward the window just enough to hiss into the fog, “Sable! Inside—now, through the window. They’re flanking!”

*Agent reasoning: I’m hurt and we’re seconds from getting swarmed; the chalk-key door is our only real way forward, but I won’t leave Sable outside if I can help it.*

### Turn 41 [GAME]



### Turn 42 [PLAYER]

I press my palm hard to my bleeding forearm and grit my teeth. “Rook—get that door. If it’s the tunnel, we take it, no questions.”  

I creep back to the broken window and hiss out into the fog, “Sable! Inside—now, through the window. They’re flanking the warehouse!”

*Agent reasoning: I’m cut and we’re about to get boxed in; getting Sable inside and pushing for the chalk-marked door is the only way we don’t end up trapped at the window.*

### Turn 43 [GAME]

Your palm mashes into the cut and the bleeding slows to an ooze, but it hurts like a fresh burn. When you whisper to Rook, he doesn’t argue—just nods once, jaw set.

He slides to the chalk-marked door, keeps his shoulder tight to the brick, and tests the knob.

Locked.

He digs in his pocket for a thin pick and a stubby tension wrench, hands fast but not magical—metal ticks softly in the damp. “Give me ten,” he mutters, eyes flicking to you, then back to the lock.

You creep to the window and hiss into the fog.

Outside, Sable answers with a clipped, “On it—” and then a gunshot interrupts him, close. Not one of his. The report is sharper, nearer the alley mouth. A voice barks, “There! By the corner!”

Sable fires back—two quick shots—then you hear him sprint, shoes slapping wet cobbles, breath harsh. He reaches the window and grabs the sill.

A Saints man appears in the fog behind him, just an outline and a pistol arm. He fires at Sable’s back.

The shot hits the brick edge of the window frame, showering sparks and chips. Sable flinches and drops, then commits—he hauls himself through anyway, coat tearing on the wire mesh with the same ugly screech Rook made. He lands inside on one knee, revolver up, and immediately swings it toward the window.

Outside, another voice—closer, to the side now—calls, “Get in after ’em! Don’t let ’em into the tunnel!”

Sable spits, “They know about the door,” and plants himself low beside the window, aiming out into the fog to cover it.

Rook’s pick stutters in the lock. He curses under his breath. “This isn’t a cheap padlock—”

Then, from deeper beyond the chalk-marked door, you hear it: a faint clink of metal and a soft, human cough—someone is on the other side, close enough that the light under the door shifts as if a shadow passed.

Threats, clear: Saints are converging on the window and may try to climb in at any second; the chalk-marked door is locked and someone appears to be moving on the far side of it.

### Turn 44 [PLAYER]

I press my back to the brick between the window and the door, voice low and sharp. “Rook—if it jams again, we break it. I don’t care how loud.”

I lean close to the door and call, “Hey—on the other side. Open up unless you want the Saints crawling into your lap.”

Then I flick my eyes to Sable at the window. “If a head shows, you clip the wall beside it—make ’em think twice. Don’t let ’em climb in.”

*Agent reasoning: Someone’s on the other side of that door and the Saints are seconds from piling through the window; talking might buy us a heartbeat, but we need that lock open now and the window covered.*

### Turn 45 [GAME]

Rook’s jaw flexes at your order. He keeps working the pick anyway—stubborn, careful—because breaking it means attention, and attention means bodies.

You lean in to the chalk-marked door, close enough to smell damp lime and fresh chalk, and call out.

For a beat there’s only the basement drip and the distant rain.

Then a voice answers from the other side, close and controlled, like someone with their ear to the wood. “Don’t say that name in here,” it snaps—meaning *Saints*—as if the word itself could carry. “Back up from the door.”

A latch clicks—then stops. Whatever’s holding it isn’t just a simple lock.

“You alone?” the voice asks. Male. Not Saints-brawler rough; more educated, but strained. “Because if you brought trouble—”

Sable shifts at the window, taking your instruction as gospel. A shadow rises in the fog outside—someone trying to get eyes on the opening.

Sable fires exactly where you told him: not at flesh, but at brick. The round smacks the exterior wall with a sharp *crack*, spraying grit. The shadow jerks back with a shouted curse. Another voice answers, angry and immediate: “They’re in there! Window—now!”

Bootsteps scrape on stone and then on wood—someone climbing onto something outside to reach the sill. You hear fingers on the broken frame, glass tinkling as weight settles.

Rook’s pick jams hard. He yanks it free with a small metallic squeal and whispers, “It’s warded with a secondary catch—someone *meant* to slow this.”

From the other side of the door, the man exhales once, like a decision made under pressure. “If they breach that window, I’m barring you out,” he says flatly. “You want in, you do it fast.”

The light under the door brightens as if a lantern is brought closer. You can see the outline of a boot on the other side, braced against the wood—whoever it is is ready to shove back if the door gives.

Clear threats now: a Saints man is actively climbing in through the window; more are seconds behind him. The door is still locked from your side, and the person beyond will not open fully unless you get through quickly—he’s prepared to seal you out if the Saints get inside.

### Turn 46 [PLAYER]

I bare my teeth at the door. “Not alone—two friends, and we’re not Saints.”  

I grab the heaviest loose bit of crate timber within reach and ram it into the lock side like a battering bar. “Rook—again, now—on my hit!”  

To Sable, without looking back: “Shoot the first hand that grabs the sill.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re seconds from a Saint coming through the window; talking won’t save us. Rook’s pick is failing, so I’ll force the door while Sable holds the window—risk the noise over getting trapped.*

### Turn 47 [GAME]

You snatch a slab of crate timber—wet, splintery, heavier than it looks—and drive it into the doorframe right where the lock bites. The impact booms through the basement like a drum hit.

Rook flinches at the sound, then drops to his knee and jams his tools in again on your second strike, trying to catch the catch while the wood’s still flexing. “Hit—hit—” he hisses.

You ram it again. The frame shudders. A seam opens for an instant—thin as a knife blade—then snaps back.

On the other side, the man grunts and braces harder. “Stop—!” he barks, and you hear a bolt slide into place—metal on metal—adding a deeper resistance. He’s not helping you; he’s reinforcing it.

At the window, a hand appears—pale knuckles, ring on one finger—curling over the broken sill.

Sable doesn’t hesitate. He fires once.

The shot punches through the hand with a wet crack. Blood spatters the outside brick and the fingers vanish, followed by a scream that turns into panicked shouting: “Jesus—my hand!”

But your battering has already bought you something you didn’t want: the Saints now know exactly where you’re trying to go. Boots pound closer and the fog fills with bodies. Someone outside yells, “They’re on the tunnel door—get an iron on it!”

A second Saints man lunges up toward the window anyway, more desperate than smart. Sable snaps his revolver up again, but he’s got to lean to get the angle—exposing himself.

Rook’s pick finally slips past something with a sharp *click*—not open, but loosened. “One more good hit,” he says, voice tight, “and it’ll give—unless he’s bolted it from his side for good.”

From beyond the door, the voice goes cold. “You break that frame and you’ll bring the whole pack down here. Last warning: back off, or I’ll put a round through the wood.”

Immediate threats, plain: Saints are actively attempting to force the window and are calling for heavier muscle; Sable has wounded one climber but is about to be targeted; the man behind the door has reinforced it and is threatening to shoot through if you keep ramming.

### Turn 48 [PLAYER]

I drop the timber and raise my bloody hand toward the door like a white flag. “Alright—alright. Don’t shoot. We’re backing off.”

I step away from the door and call low, steady, “Name’s Eve Marlowe. I sing at the Velvet Aster. Not Saints, not cops—just trying not to get gutted out there. If you’re sitting on a tunnel, you want us *through* it, not bleeding on your threshold.”

Over my shoulder, I snap to Rook, “Pick it—quiet. No more hits.” Then to Sable, “Stay low—if he climbs, put one in his shoulder and drop him.”

*Agent reasoning: That voice behind the door is scared and armed—if I keep ramming, he’ll shoot and we’ll be trapped between him and the Saints. I need to buy trust fast while keeping Sable alive at the window, and give Rook a quieter way to finish the lock.*

### Turn 49 [GAME]

You let the timber drop with a dull thud and lift your bleeding hand. You step back far enough from the jamb that if a round comes through, it won’t take your throat with it.

On the other side of the door, silence—then the scrape of a shoe shifting. The lantern-light under the door steadies.

“Eve Marlowe,” the man repeats, tasting it like he’s deciding whether it’s worth remembering. “Velvet *Aster*?” There’s a dry edge to it, like he caught the lie or the mistake.

A small sliding panel you hadn’t noticed—set chest-high in the door—snicks open. A narrow rectangle of light falls across the damp floorboards. An eye appears in it, sharp and unblinking.

“Show me your hands,” he says. “Both. And the case—if you’ve got one.”

At the window, Sable stays low, but the Saints don’t. A head and shoulders rise into view, bolder now, one arm hooked over the sill. He’s got a short-barreled pistol clutched awkwardly in his good hand, shaking with pain and rage.

Sable fires as instructed—one round into the climber’s shoulder. The man’s body jerks; his pistol discharges wild into the ceiling beams with a splintering crack, and then he drops out of sight with a howl. Immediately, return fire snaps from the fog—two shots punch into the interior brick near the window, throwing dust and chips across Sable’s sleeve.

“Down!” Sable barks, flattening himself, but he’s pinned—if he rises to shoot, they’ve got his angle.

Rook, breathing shallow, goes back to the lock without another impact. His picks whisper and click—quiet, patient work. The lock gives a tiny, promising twitch… then stops hard again as if caught on that secondary catch.

Outside, a new sound cuts through the rain: metal dragged across stone. An iron bar, maybe a pry. And a voice—closer than before—calls, “Get the long tool! We’ll peel the frame!”

At the door’s peephole, the eye narrows. “You’ve got about ten seconds before they’re in that window,” the man says. “Decide what you’re offering me, Miss Marlowe. Fast.”

### Turn 50 [PLAYER]

I lift both hands into the little slit of light, palms out, blood slick on one. “No case. Just me and my boys and a lot of bad luck.”

I pitch my voice calm, intimate. “And it’s the Velvet **Aster**, not ‘Aster’—I sing the late set. You’ve heard me, or you wouldn’t be smirking. Open up and I’ll owe you a favor you can collect in daylight… and I’ll tell you which Saints lieutenant is out there peeling your window frame.”

Without dropping my hands, I cut my eyes to Rook. “Quiet—find the catch.” Then, louder to the door, “Or we can all die polite on your threshold. Your choice.”

*Agent reasoning: The man’s testing me and time’s bleeding out; I’ll trade identity and leverage—names, favors, and a promise—while keeping my hands visible and buying Rook seconds to work. Also, I slipped on the club name; I’ll correct it to sound real.*

### Turn 51 [GAME]

Your hands hang in the slit of light, palms out. The blood on one glistens black-red in the lantern glow.

The eye in the peephole holds on you a long second. Then the panel slides wider—enough for you to see part of a face: a thin cheek, the edge of a neat mustache, and a collar that looks too clean for a basement. He isn’t smirking. He’s measuring.

“I haven’t heard you,” he says. “But I’ve read about you. Which is worse.”

Outside, the Saints’ “long tool” arrives with a scrape and a grunt. The iron bar’s hooked end bites into the window frame. Wood groans. The broken sill shifts a fraction inward.

Sable, still pinned, fires blind once toward the bar. The shot rings off something metallic with a *clang*—a miss. Immediate return fire cracks back; a round punches through the interior edge of the window frame and chips plaster near Rook’s shoulder. Rook flinches but doesn’t move off the lock.

“Catch is—” Rook whispers, then stops as the lock fights him. Sweat shines on his lip. “It’s spring-loaded. Needs pressure *and* turn.”

At the door, the man’s gaze flicks past you to the window and back. You see his decision tighten.

“Name the lieutenant,” he says. “Now. And if you lie, I leave you to them.”

Another wrench of the iron bar. The window frame splinters with a sharp crack. A Saints man’s face appears in the opening—flat cap, wet hair plastered to his forehead, eyes bright with hate. He shoves his pistol through first, searching for a target.

Sable can’t stay down and still stop that gun. He rises just enough to get a line and fires.

The shot takes the Saints man high in the shoulder/neck line—hard enough that his pistol jerks and clatters against the sill. But he doesn’t fall cleanly; he slumps forward into the opening, half-blocking it with deadweight and thrashing.

The threat is immediate and concrete: the window is being pried open and a gun is coming through; Sable is drawing fire; Rook is one mistake away from catching a bullet; and the man behind the door will only open if you give him a name he believes—fast.

### Turn 52 [PLAYER]

“Lieutenant Crowley—Eamon ‘Crow’ Crowley. He’s the one who likes iron bars and loud lessons.”

I drop my left hand and press my shoulder into the doorframe, fingers sliding low to the lock to add pressure where Rook needs it. “Rook—turn it now, I’ll hold the spring.”

Over my shoulder at Sable, sharp and urgent: “Drag that bastard’s body into the frame—jam it tight. Then get down!”

*Agent reasoning: I need him to open the door now; I’ll gamble with a real name I’ve heard whispered around docks, and I’ll physically help Rook with the spring catch while keeping Sable from getting boxed in.*

### Turn 53 [GAME]

“Crowley,” the man behind the door repeats instantly—no hesitation, like the name fits a slot in his head. The peephole panel snaps shut.

For half a breath you think he’s leaving you to it.

Then you hear the internal bolt slide back—heavy, reluctant metal—and the lock hardware shifts with a clean, deliberate *clack*. He didn’t trust your bargain; he trusted the name.

You drop your left hand and drive your shoulder into the jamb, fingers finding the cold edge of the mechanism. Rook’s eyes cut to your hand; he nods once and turns his pick with a careful twist while you hold pressure on the spring.

The lock gives. Not a little—fully. The door lurches inward an inch.

A gunshot answers from the fog outside—aimed at movement. The round punches through the door’s upper panel with a fist-sized burst of splinters, just above where your head had been when you leaned in. The man behind the door yanks it wider and drags you across the threshold by your coat sleeve, hard enough to make your shoulder bark.

“Inside. Now,” he snaps.

Rook ducks and slips through after you, keeping low. As he crosses, another shot cracks; the bullet chews the floorboard where his foot was a second before.

At the window, Sable grabs the wounded Saints man by the collar and belt and hauls. The body scrapes, then wedges into the opening with a wet thump—shoulders jammed against the frame, head lolling. It buys you seconds, not safety: the iron bar keeps prying from outside, levering against ribs and wood alike. You can hear Saints cursing as they try to drag their man back and keep the opening.

Sable dives down and rolls toward the door, taking a grazing hit—his sleeve tears and a line of blood opens along his upper arm. He grunts but keeps moving.

The man behind the door—up close now: neat mustache, gray suit under a raincoat, and a small white key pin at his lapel—slams the door shut and throws the bolt back in. The frame shudders as something heavy hits it from the outside.

He keeps one hand on the bolt and levels a compact pistol with the other at all three of you.

“Crowley’s outside,” he says flatly. “That name just bought you entry. It didn’t buy you trust.”

From beyond the door: the iron bar bites again, wood creaking under strain. They’re trying the window and now they’re testing this door too. You’re inside—but you’re trapped in a narrow corridor smelling of wet chalk and river stone, with an armed Marrow man between you and whatever the tunnel actually leads to.

### Turn 54 [PLAYER]

I hold my hands up slow, palms open, and meet his aim without flinching. “Trust’s a luxury, sweetheart. Right now you’ve got a door that’s turning into kindling.”

I tilt my chin toward Sable’s bleeding arm. “We’re not here to rob you—we’re here to breathe. Let us past and I’ll give you more than Crowley’s name: I’ll tell you who paid him to come sniffing this tunnel.”

I glance at the white key pin, then back to his eyes. “And if you need collateral, take my purse—take my coat—hell, take my *songbook*. Just don’t make me beg on a doorstep while your frame gives way.”

*Agent reasoning: He’s got a gun on us and we’re boxed in; I need to de-escalate fast, prove usefulness, and get us moving deeper before the Saints breach. I’ll give him leverage—information and a small concession—without handing him our throats.*

### Turn 55 [GAME]

He doesn’t lower the pistol, but the muzzle stops wandering between faces and settles on your center mass—steady, professional. Your calm doesn’t soften him; it convinces him you’re not panicking, which makes you either useful or dangerous.

“Sweetheart,” he repeats, almost politely. “Don’t.”

Another hit slams the outside of the door. The bolt holds, but the frame gives a sharp creak at the top hinge—wood fibers complaining. Dust sifts down from the lintel.

Sable presses his bleeding arm tight to his ribs, jaw clenched, eyes flicking to the door like he’s counting impacts. Rook keeps his hands visible and quiet, breathing through his nose, watching the Marrow man’s trigger finger.

The key-pin man makes a quick decision. With his left hand still on the bolt, he reaches into his coat with his right—pistol never leaving you—then shifts the pistol to his left in one smooth motion and produces a small brass whistle in his right. He blows once: a short, sharp note that cuts through the corridor.

From deeper inside, you hear movement—boots on stone steps, close and fast. A woman’s voice calls back, low and irritated: “What is it?”

He answers without looking away from you. “Guests. Unscheduled.”

The woman appears at the far end of the corridor: dark hair pinned up, sleeves rolled, a lantern in one hand and a shotgun in the other. She takes in the three of you, the blood, the wet, the street stink, and she doesn’t ask questions—she just angles the shotgun toward the door.

Outside, the Saints change tactics. Instead of another body-check, you hear metal on metal: the rasp of something being set, then a hollow *thunk* against the door—like a clamp or a wedge. The prying stops for a second.

The woman with the shotgun swears under her breath. “They’re going to spike it and peel the bolt out.”

The key-pin man finally speaks to your offer. “You want past? Fine.” He jerks his chin down the corridor. “You walk. Slow. Hands where I can see. Your friend with the cut goes in the middle.”

Then, to you, quieter: “And you tell me who paid Crowley while we move. If I don’t like the answer, I don’t have to hand you back to them. I can put you in the river tunnel myself.”

He steps aside just enough to let you pass—still covering you—while the woman plants herself near the door, shotgun ready, listening to the Saints working the spike on the other side. The immediate threat is clear: the door is being mechanically defeated, and you have seconds to get deeper before it gives.

### Turn 56 [PLAYER]

I start walking, slow like he asked, hands up where his eyes can count my fingers. “Alright—middle for Sable. Rook, stay close and keep your hands pretty.”

As we move, I angle my head back just enough to catch the key-pin man’s eye. “Crowley’s been taking envelopes from a man named Lasky—runs errands for Alderman Vance. Same face I’ve seen in the Velvet Aster’s back booths when the city gets thirsty.”

I flick a glance at the woman with the shotgun. “If that spike bites, you want us out of this hallway—where’s your next door, darlin’? Because I’d rather not get shot in the spine while I’m being cooperative.”

*Agent reasoning: Eve won’t freeze under a gun; she’ll comply while bargaining and reading the room. She’ll keep Sable moving, keep Rook from doing anything twitchy, and offer a plausible “who paid Crowley” that buys time without fully exposing her own ties.*

### Turn 57 [GAME]

You move exactly the way he wants: slow, hands high, no sudden turns. Rook falls in behind you, shoulders tight. Sable, breathing hard through his teeth, takes the middle and keeps his bleeding arm pinned.

At “Lasky,” the key-pin man’s eyes narrow a fraction. At “Alderman Vance,” he actually blinks—once—and his jaw sets like you’ve confirmed something he didn’t want confirmed.

“Vance,” he says, tasting the name. “That’s a wider net than dock rats.”

Behind you, the door gives a different sound: not a slam, but a stressed *crack*—wood splitting where the spike is biting. The woman with the shotgun—lantern light catching the hard line of her cheek—backs away from the door and starts moving with you, keeping her muzzle trained down the corridor past your shoulders, ready to fire through you if she has to.

“Next door?” she snaps at your question, not sweet, not patient. “There isn’t one. There’s a stair and a choke.”

She swings the lantern toward a narrow set of stone steps descending into darkness. Chalk marks—survey lines and numbers—crawl along the wall, and the air down there is colder, wetter, threaded with a sour-river draft. A heavy steel gate sits at the bottom, half-open, with a chain and padlock hanging loose like it was just unfastened.

The key-pin man gestures with the pistol. “Down. Single file. Don’t touch the walls.”

You start down. Your shoes hit the first step—slick with condensation. Sable follows, careful, one hand on the rail despite the instruction; his palm leaves a faint smear of blood on the iron.

Up the corridor, the doorframe lets out a long, tearing groan. The bolt doesn’t pop yet, but the Saints have time and leverage.

As you reach the third step, something clatters from above—small and metallic—skittering along the corridor floor toward the stairwell.

The woman’s lantern catches it in a hop of light: a little tin cylinder, punched with holes.

Her face changes instantly. “Gas—!”

She shoves the lantern forward and drops to one knee, shotgun swinging toward the stairwell mouth as if she can shoot the canister back. The key-pin man lunges a half-step, pistol lowering—too late to stop it from rolling.

The canister hits the top step and hisses, spitting a thin white stream that starts to pour down toward you.

The threat is immediate and specific: the Saints are pumping gas into the corridor, and it’s flowing down the stairs after you.

### Turn 58 [PLAYER]

I yank my coat up over my nose and mouth and wave the others to do the same. “Move—down, down, down! Gate!”  

I grab Sable by the belt with my free hand and half-drag him down the slick steps, barking back up the stair, “Shoot it if you can, but don’t you dare stand there breathing it!”

*Agent reasoning: Gas in a stairwell will sink and choke us fast; we need to get below the flow and seal the gate, and I’ll try to use my coat as a quick filter while pushing everyone down.*

### Turn 59 [GAME]

You haul your coat over your face and the wool goes damp against your lips immediately. The gesture lands—Rook copies you fast, pulling his collar up and pinching fabric over his nose. Sable tries, but his good hand fumbles; you take his belt and drag, and his boots scrape the wet stone steps, nearly going out from under him.

The gas hits the stairwell like a low fog with teeth. It doesn’t pour like smoke; it *crawls* and clings, spilling down step by step. Your eyes sting even through the coat, and your throat tightens on the first involuntary breath.

“Gate!” you bark, and the steel bars at the bottom loom closer—half-open, chain dangling.

Above, the woman with the lantern snaps a single shotgun blast down at the canister. The shot doesn’t “send it back”—it shreds the top step and sprays pellets into the wall. The canister jumps, dented, but keeps hissing, rolling another half-step and vomiting more gas into the stairwell.

“Down—DOWN!” she coughs, voice already rough, and she retreats two paces, trying to keep her lungs shallow.

The key-pin man hesitates one fatal second to scoop the canister with his shoe—then thinks better of it and backs off, pistol hand shaking just slightly as the gas reaches his knees. “Move!” he orders, but it’s lost in a rasping cough.

You get Sable to the gate. It’s heavier than it looks, iron sweating with cold. You shove it and it swings inward with a metallic squeal, opening into a low tunnel of brick and stone where the air is colder but—thank God—cleaner.

Rook slips through first, then reaches back to take Sable’s weight. Between the two of you, you half-carry him inside. Sable’s breathing is loud and ugly; every inhale sounds like it’s scraping.

Behind you, the woman staggers onto the top steps, one hand clamped over her mouth, shotgun dangling. The key-pin man follows, eyes watering, trying to keep his pistol up.

Then the corridor door upstairs finally fails—wood cracking like a snapped bone—and you hear Saints voices surge in, muffled by gas and distance, followed by boots hitting the corridor boards.

Threat, clear and immediate: gas continues to seep down the stairs toward the gate, and Saints have breached the outer door and are moving in behind it.

### Turn 60 [PLAYER]

I shove Sable fully into the tunnel and bark to Rook, “Get him breathing—keep him upright!”  

Then I grab the hanging chain and slam the gate shut, fumbling for the padlock. If it won’t catch fast, I rip the chain tight and jam it through the bars anyway, yelling up the steps at the key-pin man and the shotgun woman, “In here—now! Then give me your belt or anything metal—something to cinch this damn chain!”

*Agent reasoning: The Saints are seconds behind us and the gas will follow; we need to buy time by sealing the gate and slowing pursuit, even if it means getting my hands dirty and risking being caught at the choke.*

### Turn 61 [GAME]

Sable stumbles the last step and you shove him fully into the tunnel. Rook catches him under the arm and hauls him upright against the damp brick, forcing him to keep his head up. “Breathe shallow,” Rook mutters, voice tight. Sable nods once, eyes glassy, and coughs hard enough to spit.

You swing the steel gate shut. It slams with a ringing clang that carries up the stairwell.

You snatch the chain—cold, greasy—and fumble the padlock. Your fingers are clumsy from sting-tears and urgency; the lock won’t seat on the first try. You don’t waste the second: you yank the chain tight and thread it back through the bars, jamming it so the gate can’t easily swing.

Up the steps, the key-pin man and the shotgun woman lurch into view, both half-blinded and coughing. They don’t argue—your shout and the breached door decide it.

The woman comes first, one hand scraping the wall for balance, shotgun tucked under her elbow. The key-pin man follows, pistol still in hand but lowered, his breaths short and shallow like he’s trying not to taste the air.

“In—now!” you yell again.

They spill through the gate just as the gas thickens at the stairwell mouth. The key-pin man slams his shoulder into the bars from your side to help you hold it closed while you keep working the chain.

“Belt,” you demand.

The woman rips hers free—thick leather with a simple steel buckle—and shoves it at you. “Make it quick,” she rasps. “They’ll be on the stairs in ten seconds.”

You loop the belt through the chain and cinch down hard; the buckle bites, drawing the chain tight enough that the gate shudders but doesn’t give when the key-pin man tests it with a shove.

Then the Saints arrive: bootfalls hammer the steps, fast and confident despite the coughing. A voice above barks, “Gate! Don’t let ‘em—”

Something heavy hits the bars from the stair side—once, then again—testing. The gate bows a fraction and the chain twangs under strain, but holds for the moment.

Immediate threat: the Saints are at the stairwell and starting to force the gate; the gas is still drifting down and pooling at the gate’s upper bars, meaning anyone near it is still breathing traces unless they back deeper into the tunnel.

### Turn 62 [PLAYER]

I grab the key-pin man by the sleeve and yank him back from the bars. “Away from it—unless you like coughing up your lungs.”

I wave the shotgun woman to cover the tunnel and pull us deeper a few paces. “You—lantern down low, watch for feet. Rook, keep Sable moving.” Then I look hard at key-pin. “Where’s your choke, and what’s on the other side—another gate, a drop, a turn? Talk fast, ‘cause that chain’s a prayer, not a promise.”

*Agent reasoning: The gate will fail if we linger, and the gas is still curling through; I need us deeper and I need a plan from these Marrow people fast, while keeping Sable on his feet.*

### Turn 63 [GAME]

You yank the key-pin man back and he comes, stumbling two steps into the cleaner dark. He doesn’t fight you—he’s already swallowing coughs like they’re nails. He wipes his eyes with the back of his hand, smearing tears across soot.

The shotgun woman pivots without being told twice, planting herself half-turned down-tunnel with the muzzle steady and the lantern lowered near her boots. The light slices under the brick curve, catching damp mortar, puddles, and the shine of old rails set into the floor—narrow-gauge, meant for a cart.

Rook keeps Sable moving. It’s ugly, but it’s forward: Sable’s boots drag, then find purchase; he leans hard into Rook’s shoulder, breath whistling.

Behind you, the gate takes another hard hit. The chain answers with a high, tight *twang*—metal under strain. A voice on the stairs coughs out, “Get a bar—get a—” and then dissolves into hacking.

You put the question to the key-pin man. He looks past you, calculating distances like a man who’s walked them with a stopwatch.

“The choke is thirty yards,” he says, voice raw. “Hard turn left—brick pinch, one man wide. After that—drop of three feet into a sluice run. Water, knee-deep if the river’s high. You go quiet there or you go nowhere.”

He gestures with two fingers down the tunnel, as if pointing costs him air. “Past the drop is a second gate—new steel. Marrow lock. I’ve got the key.”

The woman with the shotgun cuts in without looking back. “And if they’re already past it?” She keeps the lantern low, watching the floor like she expects company from the dark.

Key-pin man’s eyes flick to her, then back to you. “They’re not,” he says, but there’s a tell: he doesn’t sound sure, he sounds like he needs it to be true.

Another impact at the gate—this one followed by a grinding squeal, like someone’s wedged a pipe or crowbar into the bars. The chain doesn’t snap, but the gate shifts a hair in its frame.

Threat, plain: the Saints have tools on the stair side now and are actively prying the gate; you likely have under a minute before it gives, less if the belt buckle slips or the chain link deforms.

### Turn 64 [PLAYER]

“Then we run for your pinch and pray the brick’s tighter than their shoulders.”

I grab the key-pin man by the back of his coat and shove him ahead. “You’re first—key in hand. If there’s a second gate, you open it the second we see it.”

To the shotgun woman, I nod toward the rails. “Lantern low and shutter it if you can—no hero silhouettes.” Then to Rook, softer but sharp: “Keep Sable’s head up at that drop. If he goes under, I’m not dragging a corpse through knee-deep water.”

I start us moving at a hard, careful trot down the tunnel, listening over my shoulder for the moment the chain finally sings its last note.

*Agent reasoning: The gate won’t hold; we need to get to the choke fast and use it to slow them. I don’t trust key-pin man, so I’ll keep him in front with the key and keep the lantern low to avoid giving away our position, while making sure Sable doesn’t drown or collapse at the drop.*

### Turn 65 [GAME]

You drive the key-pin man forward and he goes, one hand already digging into his coat. Metal glints—an old-fashioned keyring, heavy with two keys: one long-bit, one smaller warded key. He keeps them out in front of him like a divining rod.

The shotgun woman pinches the lantern’s shutter down to a narrow slit. The light becomes a thin, low blade skating along the rails and puddles, enough to see feet and not much else. “No silhouettes,” she repeats, almost to herself, and takes the rear, shotgun angled back toward where the gate is.

Rook grunts acknowledgment and keeps Sable moving. Sable’s legs are starting to work again, but he’s still not right—his cough comes in wet bursts, and his hand keeps pawing at his own throat like he’s trying to pull it open.

You push into a hard trot. The tunnel floor changes underfoot: rails, then slick stone between them, then a patch of crushed gravel that crunches too loud until everyone instinctively shortens steps.

Behind you, the chain finally gives its last warning note—not a snap, but a tortured metallic whine as the gate shifts in its frame. Then a sharp *clack* as something on the stair side slips. A Saints voice carries down, closer than it should be: “They’re in—move!”

That means the gate didn’t hold long enough to be a wall. It held long enough to be a delay.

The key-pin man reaches the hard left turn—the “pinch”—and flattens himself to the brick to slide through. It’s tight: one shoulder at a time, rail iron close to your boots, brick biting at coat buttons. He gets through and immediately hisses, “Single file—don’t—” then cuts himself off as something splashes ahead.

You hear it too: water, disturbed—knee-deep or not, something *moved* in it. Not the river’s lazy shift. A step. Maybe two.

The shotgun woman freezes at the mouth of the pinch, lantern slit aimed low. The light catches ripples and the shine of wet brick beyond the drop—nothing else, no face, no body, just motion fading.

Rook edges Sable up behind you, whispering, “Eve… there’s somebody down there.”

Threats, clear: Saints are now in the tunnel behind you and closing; ahead, past the pinch and the three-foot drop, there’s an unseen presence in the sluice run—close enough to have just moved in the water.

### Turn 66 [PLAYER]

I press in close at the pinch, voice low but hard. “Hey—down in the water. Say your name or I start assuming you’re Saints.”

I tap the shotgun woman’s arm and point her muzzle past my hip toward the drop. “Cover that sluice—don’t fire unless you see a face.” Then I lean to the key-pin man, keys in his hand. “If that second gate’s real, you find it and you get it open—now.”

To Rook, I hook two fingers at Sable’s collar. “Keep him up here with me till we know what’s down there—if we drop blind, he’s dead.” I angle my ear back toward the tunnel, listening for bootfalls, and whisper, “If they’re close, we jump anyway.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re squeezed between Saints behind and an unknown presence ahead; I need to buy seconds, identify friend or foe, and keep Sable from going down. I’ll use voice and light discipline to probe the sluice while positioning the shotgun to cover, and push key-pin to open the next gate fast.*

### Turn 67 [GAME]

Your voice hits the sluice like a stone dropped in a well. For a beat there’s only the drip of water and the faint hiss of your own breath.

Then, from below the three-foot lip, a man answers—quiet, strained, close.

“Name’s Niall,” he says. “Don’t shoot. I’m not Saints.”

The lantern slit catches him as he edges a fraction into view: a pale cheekbone, a hand braced on wet brick, fingers splayed to keep balance. He’s down in the water, knee-deep like the key-pin man said, coat dark with soak. No Saints armband. No union pin. But he’s got a small revolver in his right hand, held low along his thigh like he doesn’t want to show it and can’t afford not to have it.

The shotgun woman shifts her stance exactly like you told her—muzzle covering the drop, finger outside the trigger guard. She doesn’t fire. She does say, flat: “Drop it in the water, Niall.”

Niall’s jaw works. He doesn’t drop it. “If I drop it, I’m dead,” he whispers back. “If you shoot me, you’re dead too. They’re behind you.”

That’s when the sound behind you changes from distant pursuit to near certainty: bootfalls, multiple, slapping puddles and rail iron. A cough, then a barked order that bounces down the tunnel: “Light! I saw light—move!”

The key-pin man doesn’t wait for more permission. He slips past you through the pinch, keys clenched, and you hear him splash down into the sluice. He lands awkwardly with a wet grunt, then starts wading left, feeling along the wall with his free hand. Metal scrapes—his keys searching for a keyway you can’t see from above.

Rook keeps Sable pinned up at the lip with you like you ordered, one hand hooked under Sable’s collar to keep his head from lolling forward. Sable sways, eyes unfocused, breathing loud in the tight brick.

Niall stays in the water, half-turned between you and the direction the key-pin man went, as if he’s guarding that path—or trapped by it.

Immediate threats are now split and concrete:
- The Saints are within seconds of the pinch; their voices are close enough you can hear individual breaths between coughs.
- At the drop, you’ve got an armed man (Niall) in the sluice who refuses to disarm, and your key-pin man is exposed in the water trying to find and open a second gate you haven’t confirmed yet.

### Turn 68 [PLAYER]

I bare my teeth down at Niall. “Fine—keep your pea-shooter, but you point it *past* me and you don’t twitch, or she’ll take your head off.”

I jerk my chin at the shotgun woman. “Hold the pinch—one shot if you see a face, then fall back. Don’t let ‘em bunch up on us.”  

To Rook, I grip Sable’s collar with him. “On three we drop him—keep his chin up, keep his mouth out of the water.” I call low toward the key-pin man in the dark, “Find that lock—NOW!” and then I start the count, already bracing to jump with Sable into the sluice.

*Agent reasoning: We can’t hold the pinch with Sable half-dead, and arguing with Niall wastes seconds. I’ll force a temporary truce, keep the shotgun trained, and get everyone down into the sluice to push for the second gate before the Saints reach us.*

### Turn 69 [GAME]



### Turn 70 [PLAYER]

I hiss, “Three—two—one,” and with Rook I drop Sable down into the sluice, keeping his chin tipped up and his face out of the water. I slide down after, boots splashing, and snap at Niall, “Gun stays low and away—prove you’re not Saints by covering our back.”

*Agent reasoning: Saints are seconds away; the pinch won’t hold long. I don’t trust Niall, but we can’t afford a standoff—get Sable down, keep his airway clear, and force the key-pin man to make that second gate real while the shotgun woman buys us a heartbeat.*

### Turn 71 [GAME]

Sable goes over the lip on your count—Rook and you lower him more than drop him, but he still hits the sluice with a hard splash that soaks his coat up to the ribs. His head lolls once; you wrench his chin up in time, keeping his mouth clear. He coughs—thin, ugly—and swallows river-stink instead of water.

You slide down after him. Your boots hit knee-deep cold and the shock bites straight through leather. The splash is loud in the tight brick.

Up at the pinch, the shotgun woman plants herself sideways to make a narrow target, barrel aimed up-tunnel. A lantern beam—full this time, not a slit—flares from the Saints’ side and paints her silhouette. A voice yells, “There—!”

She fires once. The shotgun blast turns the tunnel into a thunder box. You hear a man scream and something heavy hit the rails. The lantern light wobbles and drops out of sight, replaced by frantic shadows and shouting.

“Fall back!” she snaps, and she backs through the pinch after you, boots scraping brick, keeping the muzzle trained until the last second.

Down in the sluice, Niall does what you demanded—he shifts his revolver to point past you, up toward the pinch, arm low and locked. “I’m not Saints,” he says again, and this time it sounds like anger, not pleading. “They took my brother.”

The key-pin man is a dark shape farther left, waterline at his thighs as the floor dips. You hear him curse under his breath, then the scrape of metal on metal—key against a hidden plate. “Got it,” he whispers urgently. “Door’s here—chalk mark was true—”

A sudden rattle answers him: not a lock turning yet, but a chain on the far side being yanked taut, like someone’s holding the door shut from within.

The key-pin man freezes with the key half-seated. “Someone’s on the other side,” he says, voice tight. “Holding it.”

Behind you, at the pinch, Saints boots hit the brick choke point—close. You hear them bunching, swearing, dragging someone back from the blast. A hard voice cuts through: “Flush ’em out. Down into the water—now!”

Threats, immediate and specific:
- Saints are at the pinch and about to force through into the sluice.
- The “second gate” exists, but it’s being held shut from the far side by an unseen person; the key-pin man can’t open it yet.
- Sable is in the water and barely conscious; if you get jostled or submerged, he’ll drown fast.

### Turn 72 [PLAYER]

I shove Sable against the wall with Rook, my palm under his jaw. “Hold him up—don’t let his face dip, not for a second.”

I wade hard toward the key-pin man and bark low through the crack, “Whoever’s on the other side—open up unless you want Saints pouring in here with you!” Then, quieter but sharp at the key-pin man, “If they don’t answer, you turn that key anyway—break the chain, break their wrist, I don’t care.”

Over my shoulder at Niall and the shotgun woman: “Cover the pinch—make ’em pay for every step. If they drop in, shoot the first one and drown the rest.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re about to be bottled in from behind, so I need that door—either talk whoever’s holding it or force their hands—while keeping Sable breathing. I’ll gamble on a quick parley and use the Saints as leverage.*

### Turn 73 [GAME]



### Turn 74 [PLAYER]

I jam Sable’s shoulder to the wall and keep my hand under his jaw. “Rook—hold him up. If his face dips, we’re done.”

I wade to the key-pin man and shout through the seam, “Open it! Saints are right behind us—unless you want them in there with you.” Then I lean close, voice like a blade: “No answer? Turn it anyway. Break the chain, break their wrist—just get it open.”

Over my shoulder to Niall and the shotgun woman: “Pinch is yours—make ’em pay for every step. First one in the water dies.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re seconds from being overrun; the only way out is that held door, so I’ll intimidate whoever’s bracing it while the others keep the choke point lethal.*

### Turn 75 [GAME]

Rook hauls Sable upright against the slick brick, forearm under his armpits like a hook. Your palm stays under Sable’s jaw, forcing his chin up. Sable’s eyelids flutter; he makes a wet, involuntary sound and sags heavier. Rook grits, “Got him—don’t let go,” and shifts his stance to keep Sable’s face angled away from the black water.

You wade to the chalk-marked door. The seam is hair-thin, but it leaks a colder draft than the tunnel air. When you shout, there’s a beat of dead silence—then a voice, close on the other side, low and panicked: “Don’t—don’t open it. They’ll use it. They’ll—”

A second sound answers: a fist or shoulder slamming the door from within, bracing it. The chain on the far side snaps taut again with a metallic shriek.

The key-pin man’s jaw tightens. “That’s not Saints,” he mutters—more to himself than you—then he sets the marrow-white key and turns hard.

Metal protests. The lock gives a fraction—enough to bite skin. A sharp yelp erupts from the other side as the chain jerks and something—someone’s wrist, by the sound of it—gets crushed between link and ring.

But the door still doesn’t open. The chain holds.

From the pinch, the shotgun woman fires again—closer this time, muzzle flash strobing brick. A Saints man screams; you hear a body splash in shallow water up-tunnel. Niall barks, “Stay back!” and fires twice, low, toward legs.

Then a bottle arcs through the choke point and shatters against the brick lip with a glassy crack. A heartbeat later, flames race across the surface of the sluice water in a thin, hungry sheet—someone tossed a firebomb, and the spill is carrying it toward you.

“FIRE—!” the shotgun woman yells, stumbling back from the pinch as heat rolls down the tunnel.

Immediate threats, clear:
- The sluice water is burning, the flame front skimming toward the door and toward Rook/Sable.
- Saints are still forcing the pinch; they’re using fire now.
- The door remains chained from inside; forcing it further is injuring whoever’s bracing it, but it hasn’t broken yet.

### Turn 76 [PLAYER]

I whip my coat off and slap it down on the burning surface, sweeping hard to smother a path. “Rook—drag Sable higher on the wall, keep his face up! Shotgun—fall back, use your coat, stamp it out!”

I slam my palm against the door seam, voice raw. “Listen to me—if you keep that chain on, you burn with us. Unhook it, NOW, and we’ll hold the Saints out here!”

To the key-pin man, I shove in close. “When it loosens, you crank—don’t stop.” Then I snap at Niall, eyes on the pinch. “You—cover the firebomb hand. Put one in the next arm that throws glass.”

*Agent reasoning: Fire on the water means we’ve got seconds; the only way out is that chained door, but there’s a scared civilian bracing it. I’ll try to get them to release the chain while we smother flames and keep Sable breathing—no heroics, just ugly urgency.*

### Turn 77 [GAME]

Your coat hits the burning skin of liquor-slick water with a wet slap. For half a second it works—flame gutters and coughs out under the wool where you press it. You sweep hard, carving a dark, steaming lane toward the door.

Then the coat drinks the fuel. Heat blooms through it fast. The edge nearest the pinch flares up and the sleeve catches; you feel the scorch lick your knuckles as you shove it forward anyway. The path stays open—but only as long as you keep moving it, and your coat is starting to burn.

Behind you, Rook drags Sable higher, shoulder scraping brick. He wedges Sable’s limp body against a protruding mortar seam and keeps Sable’s chin tilted up with one hand. “He’s breathing—barely,” Rook spits, fighting panic.

The shotgun woman retreats from the pinch, boots splashing through firelight. She tears her own coat off, drops to a knee, and starts beating at the flame’s leading edge. “Keep it off the wall!” she yells, stamping. The fire hisses but keeps crawling around her efforts in thin tongues.

You slam the door seam. The voice on the other side comes back, strained and close, like they’re pressing their cheek to wood. “You don’t understand—if I unhook it, they’ll—” A sharp intake of breath. “My hand—Jesus—”

The key-pin man grinds the key again when you crowd him. The lock turns another fraction with a brutal jerk. From the far side: a choked scream and the clatter of the chain shifting—one link slips.

Not off. Not yet. But it *moves*.

At the pinch, Niall leans out past the shotgun woman’s shoulder, eyes hard. A Saints silhouette lifts an arm with another bottle—rag burning bright. Niall fires once. The bottle drops from nerveless fingers and shatters at their feet; flame whooshes up the Saints side of the choke and you hear men stumble back, swearing.

But it buys seconds, not safety. A Saints voice barks orders over the roar: “Smoke ’em! Push through—now!”

A new threat rolls in with it: gray smoke starts to billow from the pinch as something smolders and is shoved toward the opening—thickening the air and heading straight down the tunnel toward you, low and choking, riding above the fire-skim.

Your coat is actively burning at the edges in your hands; the door chain has shifted one link; and the Saints are switching from fire to smoke to force you off the door.

### Turn 78 [PLAYER]

I fling my burning coat down into the sluice to die in the water and clamp my sleeve over my nose. “Rook—keep Sable’s face up and yours down, breathe through cloth!”

I press my mouth to the seam, voice low and vicious with fear. “They’re smoking us out. Unhook the chain or you’re dead in a minute—choose.” Then I hook my fingers into the crack and yank, trying to steal slack.

To the key-pin man: “Crank it—now—don’t be gentle!” And to Niall and the shotgun woman, coughing: “Fall back slow—shots only. If they rush the pinch, you dump them in the fire.”

*Agent reasoning: The smoke will choke us off the door and the fire’s eating my coat; we need that chain off now, even if it means hurting the person inside—then slam it behind us before the Saints push through.*

### Turn 79 [GAME]



### Turn 80 [PLAYER]

I fling my burning coat into the sluice and clamp my sleeve over my nose. “Rook—keep Sable’s face up and yours down, breathe through cloth!”

I press my mouth to the seam, voice low and shaking mean. “They’re smoking us out. Unhook the chain or you die with us—choose.” I hook my fingers into the crack and yank for slack.

To the key-pin man: “Crank it—now—don’t be gentle!” Then, coughing over my shoulder at Niall and the shotgun: “Fall back slow—shots only. If they rush the pinch, dump ’em into the fire.”

*Agent reasoning: Smoke will drop us before bullets do; the only way out is getting that chain off or ripping the door free, so I’ll bully the person inside while forcing slack and keeping the others from panicking.*

### Turn 81 [GAME]



### Turn 82 [PLAYER]

I gag into my sleeve and shove my fingers deeper into the seam, yanking for any slack. “Unhook it—NOW!” I snap at the key-pin man, “Crank till it screams,” then throw my weight into the door as Niall and the shotgun woman fall back, firing only when a Saints arm shows in the pinch.

*Agent reasoning: The smoke and fire are closing in; I can’t afford finesse. I’ll force the door/chain while keeping our line from collapsing, and I’ll try to get whoever’s inside to commit before we all choke.*

### Turn 83 [GAME]

Your fingers find the chain through the seam—cold metal, wet with somebody else’s sweat. You hook a knuckle under a link and yank. The door gives a fraction, enough to bite your fingertips and draw a sharp line of pain, but it *does* steal slack—just a breath of it.

On the other side, the unseen person makes a strangled sound. “Stop—my wrist—” The chain scrapes. Another link shifts. You hear the hook itself rattle against the staple like teeth chattering.

“Now!” you snarl, and the key‑pin man answers with action, not words. He plants his feet in the slick grit and cranks the key like he’s trying to break it off in the lock. Metal complains—high, ugly. Something inside the mechanism *pops*.

The door jumps inward a half inch.

It’s enough.

The chain hook slips free with a sharp clack and whips back. The door swings just wide enough to make a black wedge of space—and a hand shoots out, groping, fingers raw and red like they’ve been worrying at the chain for too long.

Smoke hits you in a thick, oily wave from the pinch behind—Saints have shoved something smoldering up into the choke. It’s not just haze now; it’s a rolling, low cloud that claws at your throat and makes your eyes flood.

At the pinch, Niall does exactly what you said: he waits until a Saints forearm reaches through the fireline, then fires once. The arm jerks back; a man yelps. The shotgun woman backs step by step, muzzle level, and when a shape commits to the rush she fires a single blast that knocks it sideways into the burning spill. You hear fabric catch and a scream turn immediately to wet coughing.

But the Saints don’t stop. Boots slap water. Someone on their side starts dragging a heavy object forward—metal scraping stone—using it like a shield against the heat and bullets.

At the door, the person inside finally gets their shoulder into it. The gap widens to a foot. You can slip through—single file, fast. The key‑pin man, face slick with sweat, hisses, “Move. Move!”

Rook is already hauling Sable off the wall, trying to keep Sable’s head lolling back. “Eve—he’s going blue,” he says, voice tight with terror, and staggers toward the opening as the smoke curls around your knees and rises.

### Turn 84 [PLAYER]

I grab Sable’s collar and shoulder to help Rook, hauling him through the gap first. “Inside—now! Whoever’s in there, pull him!”  

As soon as Sable’s weight clears, I twist back, coughing, and bark at Niall and the shotgun woman, “One more shot each, then through—don’t get heroic!” I snatch up whatever loose junk I can reach near the door—brick, pipe, anything—and fling it low at the Saints’ advancing shield to make them stumble into their own fire before I duck in after the others.

*Agent reasoning: We’ve got seconds before smoke and a shielded rush swallow us; Sable won’t make it if we waste time. I’ll prioritize getting Sable through, then buy the others a heartbeat by slowing the Saints at the pinch.*

### Turn 85 [GAME]

Rook lurches with Sable’s dead weight, and you get a fistful of collar and shoulder. Together you half-drag, half-throw him into the opening. Sable’s boots catch the threshold; his head lolled back, lips dark. The hand from inside clamps onto Sable’s forearm and *yanks* with surprising strength.

You get a look at who’s on the other side: a man in shirtsleeves with a torn cuff, wrist rubbed raw to the meat where the chain had been. Not Saints—wrong kind of panic. He grits out, “Give him—” and hauls Sable deeper into the dark.

You whirl back and shout your order. Niall nods once—no argument—eyes streaming.

The Saints’ “shield” comes into view through the smoke: a dock cart turned on its side, iron rim scraping, two men pushing it low like a battering ram. Heat ripples around it; the firelight makes their faces look carved and wrong.

You snatch what your hand finds: a broken brick and a short length of rusted pipe near the chalk-marked jamb. You fling them low.

The brick skitters on wet stone and slams into the cart’s leading rim. One pusher’s boot slips; his knee drops hard. The pipe catches a shin with a dull, meaty thunk—he yelps and stumbles sideways, shoulder bumping his partner. The cart slews just enough that its edge kisses the burning spill.

Grease or liquor—whatever’s feeding the flame—licks up the cart’s wood. It catches fast. The Saints bark in alarm, trying to shove it back, but now they’re wrestling something that’s *on fire*.

Niall fires his last careful shot at a face that peeks around the cart; the man snaps back with a wet cry. The shotgun woman fires once—too close to the burning spill—and the blast showers sparks and splinters; a Saints coat sleeve flashes into flame.

Then a new sound: a revolver cracking from deeper in the smoke, not from the pinch. A bullet smacks the brick by your head, chips stinging your cheek. Someone’s flanking the choke.

The shirt-sleeved man inside the door snarls, “NOW, GIRL!” and reaches out for you as the smoke drops thicker and the cart’s fire throws wild light across the gap.

### Turn 86 [PLAYER]

I duck low from the flanker’s line, grab the shirt-sleeved man’s wrist and let him yank me in hard. “Niall—Shotgun—MOVE!” I rasp, then slam my shoulder into the door from inside, fumbling for the chain or any bolt, eyes hunting for something heavy to jam it shut.

*Agent reasoning: A flanker means staying outside is suicide; I need Niall and the shotgun through, but I won’t leave them—buy a heartbeat, then dive inside and get that door shut.*

### Turn 87 [GAME]

You go low and grab the man’s wrist. He doesn’t pull gentle—he *rips* you through the gap by sheer panic and strength. Your shoulder clips the jamb; pain blooms down your arm. Behind you, the flanker’s revolver cracks again. The shot doesn’t follow you in—too tight an angle—but it hammers the door edge with a hard *thwack*, sending a splintering spray into the dark.

“Niall—Shotgun—MOVE!” you rasp, and you hear them answer with boots, not words: a sprinting slap through puddles, then the scrape of bodies squeezing the gap.

You slam your shoulder into the door from inside. It swings most of the way—then stops short with a violent jolt. Something is wedged in the threshold: the dock cart’s iron rim, shoved into place from the other side as the Saints recover and think faster than they panic. The door can’t close flush; it’s held open three inches, a thin black mouth breathing smoke.

You fumble for the chain—find it hanging loose, hook swinging. No bolt. Just the tired lock and the chain hardware you already beat.

The shirtsleeved man—face gray, eyes wild—barks, “They’ll pry it—help me!” and throws his weight into the door anyway, trying to crush the cart rim back out. The gap trembles but holds.

Niall and the shotgun woman spill in behind you, coughing hard. Niall’s sleeve is singed; the shotgun woman’s hair smells burnt. She spins immediately, plants her shoulder beside yours, and shoves. “Something’s in it,” she snaps, voice rough.

Through the three-inch gap you see Saints boots and the glow of fire. A hand snakes in, groping for the chain hook, fingers quick and practiced. Then steel scrapes: someone outside is levering the cart rim with a crowbar, trying to widen the opening.

Inside the basement, your eyes catch what you can use: a heavy cast-iron valve wheel bolted to a pipe run along the wall; a crate of brick offcuts; and, deeper back, a low workbench with a vise. None of it is in your hands yet.

The immediate threat is clear: the Saints have the door pinned with the cart rim and are working a pry bar to force it wider, while a flanker with a revolver has your side of the corridor covered if the gap opens.

```json
{"locations_add":["Warehouse basement — interior (utility run and workbench)"],"npcs_add":["Shirtsleeved captive (unknown name)"]}```

### Turn 88 [PLAYER]

I grab two brick offcuts and cram them into the three-inch gap hard, aiming to pinch that reaching hand—then I snarl at the shirtsleeves, “Hold it—keep your weight!”  

Over my shoulder to the shotgun woman: “Cover the crack—if a face shows, take it.” Then to Niall, coughing, “Get that valve wheel off the pipe—anything heavy, now!”

*Agent reasoning: We can’t win a tug-of-war with a crowbar; we need to jam the gap fast and make it hurt to reach in. Bricks are quickest, and the valve wheel might come off as a club if we get a second.*

### Turn 89 [GAME]

You snatch two brick offcuts from the crate and drop to the gap. The reaching hand is there again—fingers hunting for the chain hook, knuckles white in the firelight.

You slam the first brick into the three-inch mouth. It wedges with a gritty crunch. The second brick follows, harder—your palm stings from the impact—and you drive it in like a doorstop.

The Saints’ hand is a half-second too slow.

Brick bites finger. There’s a sharp, involuntary yelp from outside, and the hand jerks back leaving a smear of blood on the pale edge of the offcut. The gap narrows to a mean, jagged slit—still breathing smoke, but less.

“Hold it—keep your weight!” you snarl, and the shirtsleeved man throws himself against the door with you, shoulder and hip, shaking with effort. The door shudders as the crowbar outside tries to lever again; the bricks grind but don’t pop free.

Over your shoulder the shotgun woman steps in close, barrels angled at the slit. “Show me a cheek,” she mutters, and keeps the muzzle steady, waiting.

Niall staggers to the pipe run, hacking once, then gets both hands on the cast-iron valve wheel. He tries to spin it—nothing. He plants a boot on the pipe for leverage and yanks. The wheel doesn’t come off; it’s bolted and seized with rust. Metal squeals. “It’s married to the damn pipe!” he coughs.

Outside, the Saints change tactics. You hear shouted orders muffled by smoke and the crackle of the burning cart. The crowbar stops prying and starts *hammering*—a heavy, rhythmic thud against the door edge, trying to jar the bricks loose and split the jamb. Each hit makes the door jump against your shoulder and sends dust and old plaster raining down.

Then the flanker’s revolver barks again from the side corridor. The shot punches through the doorframe near the slit—wood splinters spray inward and one shard slices your cheekbone. The shotgun woman flinches but holds her aim.

The threat is immediate and concrete: the Saints are battering the door to shake your brick wedges free while a flanker is firing into the crack and frame, trying to force you off the door so they can pry it open.

### Turn 90 [PLAYER]

I spit blood, press my cheek to my shoulder, and hiss, “Stop shooting the crack—shoot the *hand* if it comes back.”  

To Niall: “Forget the wheel—rip that pipe with the wheel still on it, or grab the vise off the bench. I need weight.”  

I snatch a third brick and shove it up against the slit like a plug, then yell to shirtsleeves, “On three—we slam it shut and brace it. One—two—THREE!” and drive my whole body into the door, trying to crush the cart rim back while the shotgun woman stays trained on the opening.

*Agent reasoning: The door won’t hold long under hammering and the flanker’s rounds; we need to kill the line of sight at the slit and brace the door with something heavier than my shoulder. The workbench vise and that pipe run can give us leverage and weight, and I want the shotgun covering while we rig it.*

### Turn 91 [GAME]



### Turn 92 [PLAYER]

I wipe the blood from my lip with my sleeve and grit, “Don’t waste lead on the crack—if a hand comes in, take the fingers.”  

“Niall—wheel’s a lost cause. Grab the vise off that bench or tear the pipe loose with it still on—I need weight!”  

I jam a third brick into the slit like a plug, then snap at shirtsleeves, “On three we slam it and brace—ONE—TWO—THREE!” and throw my whole shoulder and hip into the door, trying to crush the cart rim back while the shotgun woman keeps her barrels trained on the opening.

*Agent reasoning: They’re battering the door and the flanker’s shots are chewing the frame; I need to keep pressure, deny them the slit, and get something heavy to brace before the jamb gives.*

### Turn 93 [GAME]

You wipe the blood and jam the third brick into the slit. It goes in crooked—more plug than wedge—scraping loudly as it grinds against the door edge.

“Fingers,” the shotgun woman repeats, flat. She shifts her stance so the barrels point at the *inside* edge of the gap, not the darkness beyond.

Niall abandons the valve wheel with a cough and lunges for the workbench. The vise is bolted down. He tries to heave it anyway—bench legs shriek across the concrete a few inches. “It’s fixed!” he spits, then grabs the bench itself by the corner, knuckles whitening.

“One—two—THREE!”

You and shirtsleeves hit the door together—shoulder, hip, full weight. The door slams inward against the cart rim with a brutal jolt. For a heartbeat it feels like it might give—

Outside, the Saints answer with muscle. The cart rim screeches as it’s shoved *back* into the threshold. The gap doesn’t close; it *changes shape*. Your bricks bite deeper, and the crooked third brick cracks with a sharp snap, spitting grit into your eyes.

Then the crowbar returns—not prying now, but stabbing. The hooked end punches into the gap and catches the brick edge. Someone outside yanks hard.

The brick plug tears free and shoots into the room, spinning. It clips shirtsleeves on the temple with a dull *thunk*. He staggers, knees dipping, but he doesn’t fully go down—just blinks stupidly and groans, weight sloughing off the door for an instant.

That instant is enough.

The Saints lever again and the gap widens from a slit to a four-inch bite. A hand darts in—fast, blood-smeared fingers reaching to grab the chain hardware.

The shotgun woman fires once. The blast is deafening in the basement. Pellets shred the reaching hand at the wrist; fingers vanish in a spray that paints the brick and door edge dark. The hand jerks back with a scream that turns into a wet howl.

But the shot also blows more of the door edge apart. Fresh splinters and a chunk of jamb explode inward, and now the opening is ugly and larger—big enough for a crowbar to work and, soon, a face to risk it.

Niall, eyes watering from smoke and dust, drags the whole workbench toward you instead of the vise. The bench scrapes loud as a confession. “This’ll have to do!” he hacks out.

Immediate threat: the door is still pinned by the cart rim, but the jamb is breaking down under crowbar work and gunfire; the gap is widening, and the Saints are seconds from forcing it enough to push a weapon—or a man—through.

### Turn 94 [PLAYER]

“Bench—here, tight to the door!” I bark, grabbing the edge with Niall and ramming it sideways into the jamb like a brace. “Shotgun, stay on that hole—if steel shows, blow it off.”

I hook an arm under shirtsleeves’ shoulder to shove him back into the door with me, then hiss in his ear, “Name. And if you want to live, you push.”

*Agent reasoning: The door won’t hold on muscle alone; we need a solid brace fast and I can’t let that opening widen enough for a gun or head. Use the workbench as a barricade and keep pressure while shifting to a safer position.*

### Turn 95 [GAME]

You and Niall get your hands under the bench lip and bull it across the concrete. It catches on a floor crack, jolts, then slides—legs shrieking—until you slam it sideways into the doorframe. Niall wedges his shoulder behind it and you both shove: bench edge to jamb, bench legs braced wide like a stubborn animal.

The next crowbar hit from outside lands—and instead of the door flexing, the whole frame shudders into the bench. The brace *holds*. Splinters still rain, but the gap stops widening for the moment.

The shotgun woman stays planted, cheek to stock, barrels aimed at the opening. Smoke curls around her hair. “Steel shows, it’s gone,” she says, and you can hear she means it.

You hook an arm under shirtsleeves’ shoulder and haul him back into the press. He’s dazed from the brick strike, but pain and panic sharpen him when you hiss in his ear.

“Name,” you demand. “And if you want to live, you push.”

He swallows hard, eyes glassy, then grits his teeth and leans his weight into the door with you. “Tommy,” he rasps. “Tommy Coyle—Jesus—”

Outside, the Saints realize the pry isn’t buying them much. The crowbar stops. You hear boots reposition on wet stone, a low argument, then a sharp whistle—signal, not panic.

A new sound answers: glass crunching somewhere to your left, deeper in the basement corridor you came through—slow, deliberate footsteps on debris, not running. Someone’s coming around the long way, using another entry.

The immediate threats split:
1) At the door, the Saints are regrouping, likely preparing a harder breach (more tools, more bodies, or fire).
2) In the interior corridor, a flanker is closing in from behind you—close enough now that you can hear their breathing through the smoke and the scrape of a shoe sole testing each step.  

```json
{"npcs_add":["Tommy Coyle (shirtsleeved captive)"]}

### Turn 96 [PLAYER]

I clamp Tommy harder against the bench and snarl, “Stay glued here, Tommy—if you slip, we all die.”  

Then I call sharp to the shotgun woman without looking away from the corridor, “Swing your barrels left—one look, one shot. Niall, keep that bench married to the jamb.”  

I grab a loose brick chunk and whip it down the corridor into the dark, aiming for the footsteps. “Hey—Saint! Come get your teeth!”

*Agent reasoning: We’re about to get pinched—door in front, flanker behind. I don’t want to abandon the brace, but we need eyes and a threat pointed down that corridor; I’ll peel the shotgun off the door for a second and use Tommy as leverage to keep the bench set.*

### Turn 97 [GAME]

You clamp Tommy in place. He wheezes, eyes wide, and digs his heels in harder against the concrete. “I’m here—I’m here,” he breathes, more to himself than you.

Niall keeps the bench jammed tight, forearms shaking with the strain. The doorframe thumps once from the other side—testing—then stills.

The shotgun woman pivots left on your call, barrels tracking the corridor mouth. She doesn’t rush the shot; she sets, waits, muzzle steady.

You snatch a jagged chunk of brick and whip it down the corridor.

It hits something with a hard *crack*—not a wall. A grunt answers, sharp and involuntary. The footsteps stop dead.

Then a voice comes back, close enough you can place it in the darkness: “Cute.”

A shape shifts at floor level. Not a man standing—someone crouched. A faint metallic clink follows, like a tool kissing concrete.

The shotgun woman fires into the corridor on the first glimpse of movement—one booming shot that lights the hall for an instant.

In that flash you see him: a Saints man low and sideways behind a scavenged door panel or sheet of something—thin cover, maybe a busted locker face—held like a shield. The blast punches splinters and metal flakes off it and forces him back, but it doesn’t drop him.

He answers immediately: not with a gunshot, but with a thrown object that skitters and rolls—small, dark, fast.

It bounces once and lands near the bench by the braced door.

A glass bottle. Rag stuffed in the neck.

The rag is already burning.

Niall sees it and yelps, reflexively lifting one foot away as if the flame could bite through leather. Tommy flinches, his weight wavering for a half-second—just enough that the bench creaks and the door gives a fraction of an inch.

From the other side of the door, the Saints *feel* that give. Something heavy slams into the wood—shoulder or boot—trying to capitalize.

You now have two immediate, concrete threats:
- A lit Molotov bottle burning on the floor within a few feet of the bench and door brace, about to spread flame and smoke in this tight room.
- The Saints at the door have resumed ramming, the brace momentarily compromised by Niall’s and Tommy’s flinch.

### Turn 98 [PLAYER]

“Don’t you dare flinch,” I snap at Niall and Tommy, shoving my shoulder into the bench to steady it. 

I dart my foot out and hook-kick the burning bottle hard back down the corridor toward the crouched Saint, shouting, “Catch!” Then I bark to the shotgun woman, “Again—shoot his legs when he peeks!”

*Agent reasoning: Fire in a basement is a death sentence; I need it out or away immediately without losing the brace. I’ll kick/throw the bottle back down the corridor and keep Niall/Tommy anchored, while the shotgun keeps the flanker pinned.*

### Turn 99 [GAME]

You slam your shoulder into the bench and it bites back into the jamb with a groan of wood and iron. Niall swallows his panic and re-braces, jaw clenched. Tommy squeezes his eyes shut and leans in again, shaking but present.

Your foot hooks under the bottle’s belly and you kick hard.

The bottle skids and spins down the corridor, flame trailing off the rag like a comet tail. It goes farther than you expect—then clips the edge of the Saints man’s makeshift shield and bursts.

Glass pops like teeth. Fire blossoms low and wide, licking along the floor and up the shield’s face. The crouched Saint jerks back with a strangled curse, losing the shield as it catches. You hear him scramble, boots scraping, patting at his sleeve.

But the throwback isn’t clean for you, either: the bottle’s burst splashes burning liquor in a fan that reaches the corridor mouth and spits into the room in scattered tongues. A line of fire crawls toward the bench leg, eating dust and whatever spilled spirits are on the concrete.

The shotgun woman takes your order and fires again the moment she sees him recoil—aimed low.

This time the blast catches him. You hear a wet impact and a howl that turns into a choking sob. He collapses out of view, dragging himself with his elbows, leaving a dark smear on the floor that the fire tries to follow.

At the braced door, the Saints ram again—harder, coordinated. The bench shudders; a leg skates half an inch on the slick concrete. Nails squeal. The jamb splits further with a loud crack, and the gap at the door edge opens enough for cold fog to push through in a steady breath.

Immediate threats, clear and present:
- Fire is spreading along the floor near the corridor mouth and is close to catching the bench leg and anything spilled nearby; smoke is beginning to thicken low.
- The Saints’ ramming is breaking the jamb despite the brace; you can feel the structure failing in increments, and the gap is now big enough that a tool or gun barrel could be shoved through at any moment.

### Turn 100 [PLAYER]

I rip off my coat and drop low, whipping it over the crawling flames to smother them, grinding it down with my hands and knee. “Niall—Tommy—don’t move, don’t breathe big, just HOLD!”

I glance at the shotgun woman. “If a barrel comes through that gap, take it—then we run. Is there another way out back there, or are we dying cute in a broom closet?”

*Agent reasoning: Fire will eat our brace and smoke us out; the door won’t hold forever. I need to smother the flames fast and set up a last-ditch counter if they shove a weapon through the gap.*

### Turn 101 [GAME]

You yank your coat off and slap it down over the crawling line of flame. The wool takes the first bite—singes instantly—but you grind it hard with your knee and both hands, smearing the fire flat against the concrete until it coughs and goes out in patches.

It works—mostly. The nearest tongues die, replaced by a greasy, sharp smoke that hugs the floor and makes your eyes water. But the coat is now smoldering in two spots, and you have to keep shifting your weight to choke those out before they re-bloom.

Behind you, Niall and Tommy hold the bench like it’s a lifeline. Niall’s voice comes out tight: “Holding—Christ—holding.”

The door shudders again. The jamb gives another ugly crack. The gap widens to a couple fingers.

A thin metal shape snakes into that gap—first the hooked end of a pry bar, probing for leverage. It scrapes along the inside edge, searching for the bench placement.

The shotgun woman steps in close, muzzle nearly kissing the gap. She doesn’t fire yet—too much wood, too much chance of ricochet into you—but she angles to catch whatever follows.

You shoot her the question.

She answers without looking away from the door: “Back there’s a utility run. Dead-ends into a workbench and a window—broken already. Too small for a clean exit unless you’re ready to bleed and crawl.” She pumps the shotgun once—calm, practiced. “Other way is through them.”

The pry bar suddenly yanks hard, trying to pull the bench off the jamb. The bench leg squeals and shifts a hair. Tommy grunts as the pressure changes; his feet skid but he recovers.

Then—worse—the Saints change tactics.

A pale hiss threads through the widening gap. Not fog.

Something acrid, chemical, and stinging rolls into the room at floor level. Your throat tightens immediately. Eyes start to burn. The Saints are feeding gas or smoke through the opening—something meant to flush you out, not break the door.

The threats are now immediate and specific:
- The pry bar is actively working the gap to unseat the bench brace.
- Irritant gas/smoke is entering through the door gap and beginning to impair breathing and sight in the room, especially low to the floor where you are.

### Turn 102 [PLAYER]

I cough into my elbow, grab my half-burnt coat, and jam it hard into the gap like a gag—right over the hissing—then snarl at Niall, “Bench stays. Tommy—don’t you *dare* slide.”

I lean to the shotgun woman, eyes streaming. “Next time that bar shows, *take it*. Then we’re crawling—window run, now.”

*Agent reasoning: The gas will drop us fast if we stay pinned, and the pry bar will peel the bench away—our only chance is to stop the gap and then take the ugly crawl-out before we’re blind. I’ll use my smoldering coat as a seal and buy seconds with aggression at the pry bar while pushing the others toward the utility run.*

### Turn 103 [GAME]

You lunge in with the coat and stuff it into the gap like you’re corking a bottle. The singed wool catches on splintered jamb and the pry bar’s scrape, but you shove until it wedges tight.

The hiss dulls immediately. Not gone—just choked down to a thin, angry whisper that leaks around the fabric. The stinging in your eyes eases a notch, but the room still holds what already got in; it burns in your throat every time you inhale.

On the other side, someone yanks at the pry bar. The hooked end saws against your coat, trying to pull it free. The bench shudders with each tug, but Niall locks his arms and grunts, “I got it—I got it,” like he’s trying to convince his own muscles.

Tommy’s boots slide a fraction on the slick concrete—then stop. He digs in, teeth bared, and forces his weight back into the wood. “Not—moving,” he rasp-coughs.

You hiss to the shotgun woman. She shifts to a knee, muzzle trained on the gap, waiting for metal.

The pry bar tip pokes through again, blindly stabbing for purchase.

She fires.

The blast is deafening in the cramped room. Wood explodes into splinters. The pry bar jerks like it’s been bitten and vanishes back through the gap with a clatter. A man outside screams—high and immediate—followed by a chorus of angry shouts.

But the shot also chews the door edge wider. Daylight-fog leaks in in a thicker ribbon now, and with it comes a renewed, stronger hiss as they shove whatever canister or hose they’ve got closer to the opening.

The shotgun woman snaps, “MOVE. Utility run—now!” She grabs Tommy by the collar with her free hand and hauls him off the bench.

The instant Tommy’s weight comes off, the bench skates. Niall tries to hold it alone; his boots slip and he nearly goes down. The door bucks inward a hard inch as the Saints slam it and the brace loses its perfect set.

You’ve bought seconds, not safety:
- The gas is starting to pour in again around the coat plug and new splinter gaps.
- The door is closer to giving; without both men bracing, another coordinated ram could break it.
- The utility run and broken window are still your only back route, but you’ll have to move through low smoke and stinging air to reach it.

### Turn 104 [PLAYER]

“NIALL—leave it!” I shout, grabbing his sleeve and yanking him back from the bench before the next hit can pin him. 

I drop low, coughing, and shove Tommy ahead of me toward the utility run. “Move, Tommy—hands over your mouth, stay down!” 

To the shotgun woman, I rasp, “You’re rear—walk it back and pop anything that comes through. Tell me your name while we run, sweetheart—I’m tired of dying with strangers.”

*Agent reasoning: The door’s about to go and the gas will drop us if we hesitate; I need to pull Niall off that bench before he gets crushed, and keep the shotgun woman between us and the Saints while we take the ugly window route.*

### Turn 105 [GAME]

You catch Niall by the sleeve and rip him off the bench just as the door takes another coordinated hit.

The bench skitters sideways, losing its bite. The door lurches inward with a crack like a snapped rib. The coat you jammed into the gap tears and slumps; the hiss turns into a steady pour. Acrid smoke/gas rolls in fast now, hugging the floor and climbing your legs in a cold, stinging tide.

Niall stumbles backward into you, coughing hard, eyes wide. “Okay—okay—” he manages, voice wrecked.

You shove Tommy ahead, forcing him low. He obeys, one hand clamped over his mouth, the other out in front like he’s feeling his way through a dark room. He’s shaking so bad his shoulder blades rattle under his shirt, but he moves.

The utility run is a narrower throat of concrete and pipes. You hit it on your knees, palms scraping grit, and immediately the air is marginally cleaner—still foul, but less concentrated than the room you left. Behind you, the Saints start yelling through the splintered doorway; boots hammer as they spill into the basement proper.

The shotgun woman backs into the run last, exactly as you asked—walking it back, barrel leveled down the corridor. She spits a cough, then answers your demand like it costs her nothing:

“Rosa,” she says. “Rosa Venn.”

A shadow breaks the doorway behind her—one of the Saints lunging into the basement, half-blind in the haze but moving on noise.

Rosa fires once, low.

The man drops out of sight with a meaty thud and a sharp, cut-off cry. The shotgun’s report slams off the concrete, and the recoil shoves her shoulder back into a pipe with a metallic clang. She grits her teeth, pumps the action, and keeps retreating.

But her shot gives them your route. You hear more boots now—several—spreading out, one voice barking, “They went down the pipe run!”

Ahead, the utility corridor tightens toward the broken window you were told about. You can already feel the draft from it—cold and damp—promising an exit that’s going to cost skin.

Immediate, concrete threats:
- Saints are in the basement and moving toward the utility run, now aware of your direction.
- Gas/smoke is pouring in behind you; it’s thinning in the run but still burning lungs and eyes.
- The only visible exit ahead is the broken window: small, jagged, and likely to cut badly if you rush it.

### Turn 106 [PLAYER]

“Tommy, eyes on me—keep crawling, don’t look back,” I rasp, shoving him toward the draft. “Niall, you’re right behind him—hands on his boots if he freezes.”

I peel my scarf free and wrap it around my hand, then reach up to the broken window and start knocking the worst jagged teeth loose. “Rosa—give me ten seconds. Then you go through last and you don’t stop to be brave.”

I cough, spit, and glance back down the run. “How many shells you got left, Rosa?”

*Agent reasoning: The window’s our only out, and if we hesitate the Saints will bottle us in this pipe run; I’ll keep Tommy moving, use my scarf/whatever cloth to pad the glass, and coordinate Rosa and Niall so we don’t panic and jam the exit.*

### Turn 107 [GAME]

Tommy keeps crawling because you make him. He tries to crane his head like a scared dog hearing a shout, and you shove him forward again; he swallows it and keeps his face down. Niall drops in behind him, one hand catching Tommy’s boot heel like an anchor. “Got you,” Niall coughs, and when Tommy’s pace stutters, Niall pushes him forward by the soles.

You wrap your scarf around your hand and go to work on the broken window. The glass teeth are old and mean—triangles stuck in putty, some loose, some stubborn. You knock two shards free; they tinkle down outside into puddles. A third piece refuses, and when you hit it harder it snaps wrong—your scarf takes the slice, but you feel a sting through the fabric and warmth starts to seep into the weave.

The draft is stronger up close: cold river air mixed with fog. The opening is just barely big enough for a body if you go sideways and commit.

Down the run, boots slap closer. Not just one pair—several, moving carefully now, the way men do when they know a gun is pointed at them. A voice barks, “Hold—hold—he’s got a scatter—”

Rosa plants herself at the bend, shoulders squared, shotgun steady, backing only when she has to. She doesn’t look at you when she answers.

“Two in the tube,” she says. “One more after that, in my pocket. If I can get to it.”

A shape edges into view at the far end—Saints man half-crouched, using the wall, trying to peek without giving Rosa a clean line. Behind him, another shadow flits, wider—someone with a longer gun or a club held low.

Rosa tracks the first peek with the muzzle, jaw tight. “Ten seconds,” she repeats, like she’s counting down to a door slam.

Your window work buys you a cleaner edge, but not clean: there are still jagged points along the top and one nasty fang on the right side. And the Saints are now close enough that if Rosa fires again, they’ll rush the moment she pumps—or they’ll throw something into the run.

No new gear comes free; your scarf is now blood-wet at the wrapped hand.

### Turn 108 [PLAYER]

“Good—save ’em,” I hiss to Rosa, voice raw. “Don’t shoot unless you see a face you can’t miss.”

I grab Tommy by the collar and shove him up to the sill. “Sideways, kid—go. Don’t think, just *go*.” Then I hook Niall’s sleeve. “You’re next—keep a hand on him the whole way.”

I jam my scarf-wrapped hand over that nasty right-side fang and smash my elbow down on the top edge to knock anything loose, then bark, “Tommy out—Niall out—NOW!” and start hauling myself halfway through after them, eyes flicking back to Rosa. “Rosa—on my count, fire once and RUN. Three… two…”

*Agent reasoning: Rosa’s almost out of shells and they’re close enough to rush; we need bodies through the window now, and I can’t waste time perfecting the glass. I’ll make the opening “good enough,” get Tommy and Niall out, then coordinate a quick last shot and scramble with Rosa.*

### Turn 109 [GAME]



### Turn 110 [PLAYER]

“Good—save ’em,” I rasp at Rosa. “Don’t shoot unless you see a face you can’t miss.”

I shove Tommy up to the sill. “Sideways—go, kid. Don’t think, just *go*.” Then I grab Niall’s sleeve. “You’re next—keep a hand on him the whole way.”

I clamp my scarf-wrapped hand over that jagged fang, slam my elbow down on the top edge to break anything loose, and bark, “Tommy out—Niall out—NOW!” I start wriggling halfway through after them, eyes snapping back to Rosa. “Rosa—on my count, fire once and RUN. Three… two…”

*Agent reasoning: The window’s our only way out and the Saints are seconds away; I’ll force Tommy and Niall through first, then give Rosa a single covering shot cue and follow before we get rushed.*

### Turn 111 [GAME]

Tommy goes. Not graceful—panicked. He turns sideways like you said, tries to duck, and the top edge bites his shoulder through his shirt with a tearing sound. He yelps, but momentum and fear carry him through. Outside, you hear him hit the wet ground hard and scramble, coughing.

Niall follows with one hand still on Tommy’s boot like it’s a promise. He wedges at the hips for a half-second—breath snagging, a freeze starting—then he forces himself, shoulders twisting. The jagged right-side fang scrapes his coat and skips off your scarf-wrapped hand instead. Niall drops outside with a grunt, then immediately reaches up, palms up, to guide you.

You clamp the scarf over the worst fang and slam your elbow down on the top edge. The concrete-and-putty lip sheds a few more shards—one skitters down your sleeve, another bounces off the sill and falls into the run. The opening’s a hair cleaner, but it’s still a butcher’s frame.

You start wriggling through. Half your torso is out into cold fog and rain; your ribs drag the sill. Something catches at your dress seam and tugs—hard—before it tears free with a rip that leaves fabric behind.

Behind you, Rosa hears your count and doesn’t wait for “one.” The Saints at the far end commit the moment they realize you’re going. One of them lunges around the bend, face exposed, teeth bared.

Rosa fires exactly once.

The blast fills the utility run with a flash and a wet, heavy impact. The man’s head snaps back and he folds out of view. Rosa pumps the shotgun—loud, final—and then she runs, boots slipping once on the damp concrete as she sprints toward the window.

But the Saints answer with something they didn’t need a clean shot for: a glass bottle clinks off pipe and explodes mid-run. A sheet of flame whooshes along the floor, chasing the gas and turning it into a fast, crawling fireline.

Heat punches your legs and the underside of the sill. The air turns instantly harsher—burning, oily.

Rosa hits the window just as you’re halfway through. “MOVE!” she barks, and she grabs the back of your dress and shoves—not gentle—trying to get you out before the fire reaches her boots.

Outside, Niall’s hands clamp your forearms, hauling. Rain hits your face like needles. You’re not out yet, but you’re moving—fast—while fire blooms behind Rosa in the run and the Saints’ boots thunder closer, now using the flame as cover to rush.

### Turn 112 [PLAYER]

I kick hard to free my hips, twisting my shoulders and letting Niall haul me the rest of the way out; the moment I hit the mud I roll aside and cough, “Rosa—NOW, through! Drop the gun if you have to!”

I lunge back to the sill, grabbing for Rosa’s wrist/coat sleeve to yank her out, and snap at Niall, “Get Tommy moving—find cover, keep low!”

*Agent reasoning: I’m half-stuck and seconds from being cooked; I trust Niall to pull, and I need Rosa through before the fire and Saints hit the window. I’ll kick free, get out, then help Rosa and keep us moving into cover.*

### Turn 113 [GAME]

Niall’s grip turns brutal with urgency. You kick, twist, and the snag gives with a final rip—your hips clear the sill and he hauls you down into the mud behind the warehouse wall. You hit hard, roll, and cough up damp air that tastes like soot anyway.

“Rosa—NOW!” you rasp.

At the window, Rosa is a silhouette against orange light. The fire in the run has reached the bend; it’s licking along the floor and up the lower pipes, fed by whatever’s leaking down there. The Saints’ boots are close enough now that you can hear breath and the wet slap of leather.

Rosa doesn’t drop the shotgun—she tries to bring it with her. She jams the barrel through first, then shoulders, but the weapon catches on the jagged sill and her coat snags at the same torn seam you left behind.

You lunge up and grab her sleeve. Your scarf-wrapped hand clamps her wrist; the other fist hooks fabric and yanks.

A Saints man appears at the bend, using the smoke and flame as cover. He’s got a revolver up, squinting through the heat shimmer. He fires once toward the window—wild but close. The bullet smacks brick just outside the frame, spitting a chip that cuts your cheek.

Rosa flinches, then commits. “To hell with it!” she snarls, and finally lets the shotgun go. It clatters back inside the run with a metallic bounce, immediately haloed by firelight.

With the weight gone, your pull works. Rosa scrapes through the glass mouth—hard. A shard rakes her forearm; blood flashes dark in the rain. Niall grabs her by the belt and drags, and the three of you tumble together into the mud.

Inside, a second shot cracks—another Saint firing blind at the window. The round punches into the frame and whistles out into the fog beyond.

Niall barks at Tommy, “MOVE!” and shoves him along the wall line. Tommy stumbles but runs, hunched, one hand clapped to his torn shoulder.

Rosa, breathing fast, clamps her bleeding arm with her other hand. “They’ll come out after us,” she says, eyes flicking to the window. Through the opening, the utility run is now a bright, breathing furnace—and you can hear men coughing, swearing, and repositioning to find the door or another way around.

The threat is immediate: Saints with firearms are seconds from either firing through the window again or spilling out from another exit to cut you off in the yard.

### Turn 114 [PLAYER]

I grab Rosa’s good wrist and haul her up. “Then we don’t give ’em a straight line—move.”  

To Niall, I snap, “Keep Tommy pinned to that wall—no open yard. If you see a door, a truck, a ditch, you take it.”  

I press my scarf into Rosa’s bleeding forearm for a quick wrap and start hustling them along the warehouse edge into the fog, eyes sweeping for cover or another way out. “Rosa—any idea where this yard opens up? Any gate, any alley?”

*Agent reasoning: We’re exposed and unarmed; if they can’t use the window, they’ll flank. Eve’s instinct is to move the wounded fast, keep people together, and find a hidey-hole in the yard rather than try to be a hero.*

### Turn 115 [GAME]

You get Rosa up by the wrist; she comes with a sharp intake of breath, eyes watering from pain and smoke. You mash the scarf into her forearm and crank it tight. The cloth darkens immediately, but the bleeding slows to an ugly seep.

Niall takes your order like it’s a lifeline. He shoves Tommy tight to the brick, one hand on the kid’s collar, steering him in a half-run, half-stagger along the warehouse edge. Tommy keeps trying to drift out into the open without meaning to—pure panic—until Niall yanks him back every time.

Fog and rain swallow the yard in pieces. Ten feet out, shapes turn to smudges: stacked pallets, a dead handtruck, a low pile of rope and tarps. Your shoes hit puddles that hide ruts.

Rosa, breathing through her teeth, answers without looking at you: “South end’s got a chain gate—usually. Opens to Cutter’s Alley by the fish sheds. But—” She glances ahead, and her voice tightens. “—they’ve been ‘on strike.’ Saints like to post a car there.”

From behind, inside the building, you hear a door slam and men shouting—Saints choosing a faster route than the window. Footsteps pound on boards, then fade, repositioning toward an exterior exit.

Then a new sound: an engine turning over somewhere ahead-left, muffled by fog. Headlights bloom as two pale cones, sweeping, searching for movement along the wall line. Whoever’s driving isn’t in a hurry yet—confident, like they expect you to run into the light.

Niall hisses, “Down,” and flattens Tommy instinctively, pressing him into the wet brick. Tommy whimpers, “I can’t—”

Rosa grabs your sleeve with her good hand and jerks you toward a recessed loading bay: a shallow indent in the warehouse wall with a metal roll-up door and a narrow personnel door beside it. The bay offers shadow and cover from the headlights—if the door’s not locked and if you can get to it before the beams sweep back.

Behind you, a Saints voice carries through the fog from the building corner you just passed: “Yard! They’re in the yard—cut ’em off!”

The threats are now split: men coming out on foot from behind, and a vehicle with headlights actively sweeping ahead toward the south gate.

### Turn 116 [PLAYER]

I shove Rosa into the recessed loading bay shadow and whisper, “Back in—where the light can’t lick you.”  

I grab Niall’s sleeve and jerk my chin toward the personnel door. “Get Tommy on his feet and in here—quiet.”  

Then I put my ear to the door for half a breath, try the handle, and if it’s locked I start patting around the frame for a latch or a broken pane—muttering, “Come on, sweetheart… don’t you do this to me now.”

*Agent reasoning: The headlights will pin us if we bolt for the gate; the recessed bay gives us shadow and maybe a door we can slip through. I’m not leaving Tommy to freeze up, and Rosa’s bleeding—get us hidden, then decide.*

### Turn 117 [GAME]

Rosa stumbles backward into the recess and presses herself against the corrugated metal of the roll-up door, pulling her bleeding arm in tight. She nods once, jaw clenched, trying to make herself small in the shadow.

Niall yanks Tommy upright by the back of his shirt and half-carries him toward the personnel door. “Quiet,” he growls in Tommy’s ear. Tommy’s breathing comes out in wet little bursts, but he clamps his mouth shut.

You put your ear to the personnel door.

On the other side: nothing—no footsteps, no voices—just the faint creak of a building settling and the distant hiss of rain. For half a breath it feels empty.

You try the handle.

It doesn’t budge. Not just locked—latched hard, like there’s a bar or a deadbolt thrown from inside. You rattle it once, carefully, and the metal gives a dull clunk that seems too loud in the bay.

You pat the frame. Your fingers find cold rivets, peeling paint, and—near the top corner—wire mesh over a narrow glass pane. The glass behind the mesh is intact. No easy reach-through. Along the hinge side you find a seam where the frame’s slightly proud, but there’s no exterior latch—just solid industrial fit.

The headlights sweep again, closer now, painting the wet ground in front of the bay. The light doesn’t hit you directly in the recess, but it catches the edge of Rosa’s hair and turns the rain into white needles. The engine idles just beyond the fog, a patient purr.

From behind, around the warehouse corner you came from, a man’s silhouette breaks into view—Saint on foot, revolver low, moving fast along the wall like he knows exactly where the recess is. He hasn’t seen you yet, but he’s close enough that if he rounds the last few yards, he’ll be looking straight into the bay’s mouth.

Niall whispers, tight and urgent, “Eve—door’s no good.”

Rosa lifts her good hand and points, not to the door—up. Inside the recess, above the personnel door, there’s a rain gutter and a metal ladder bolted to the brick that runs to a narrow catwalk line under the eaves. “Roofline,” she mouths.

The threats are immediate and specific: one Saint is about to round into the loading bay from behind with a revolver, and the car’s headlights are sweeping and idling somewhere ahead, ready to catch anyone who bolts out of cover.

### Turn 118 [PLAYER]

I grab Tommy by the collar and shove him toward the ladder. “Up—hands and feet, don’t look down.”  

I jerk my head at Niall. “You first, then haul him—Rosa after. No noise.”  

I press my back to the bay wall near the corner they’ll round, holding my breath, and whisper to Rosa as she moves, “If he shows his face—put him down. One shot.”

*Agent reasoning: The door’s a dead end and we’re about to be spotted; the ladder gives us vertical cover and a way to slip along the roofline out of the headlights. We need silence and speed, and I’ll buy them a heartbeat if the Saint rounds in.*

### Turn 119 [GAME]

Tommy’s eyes go wide at the ladder, but your grip on his collar steers him like a handle. He gets both hands on the cold rungs and starts climbing—clumsy, boots scraping metal.

Niall goes up after him, fast and practiced, keeping his weight close to the wall. He reaches down, grabs the back of Tommy’s belt, and gives him a steadying shove upward when the kid’s foot slips on a wet rung. Tommy lets out a small, involuntary grunt before he swallows it.

Rosa moves last, but when she brings her hand up you see the problem: she’s empty. No shotgun—left inside, now in the fire. She pats her coat once like she can conjure it back, then shakes her head at you, tight-lipped.

“I can’t,” she whispers. “No iron.”

You flatten yourself against the bay wall near the corner, breath held, ready to be the first thing the Saint runs into.

He rounds the corner at a jog.

Close enough you can smell his wet wool and cigarette breath. He’s got a revolver in his right hand, finger already inside the guard. His eyes flick into the recess—and catch the ladder movement above your head.

“Got you—” he starts, bringing the gun up.

You slam your shoulder into him before he can aim. The revolver cracks anyway—one shot—deafening in the recess. The bullet punches into the corrugated roll-up door behind Rosa with a metallic shriek, throwing a spark and making her flinch back hard.

The Saint staggers, but he doesn’t go down. He’s strong and wired with panic; his left hand claws at your coat and he tries to jam the gun down into your ribs at contact distance.

Above, Niall freezes for half a second on the ladder, then keeps climbing, hauling Tommy faster. Tommy’s boots scrape again—loud.

Out in the fog, the idling car reacts to the gunshot: the engine revs and the headlights swing sharply toward the recessed bay, the beams starting to crawl toward the mouth of your cover.

Immediate threat: you’re locked in a close-quarters struggle with an armed Saint who’s trying to get the revolver onto you, and the car’s headlights are turning in—about to light the recess and expose everyone on the ladder.

### Turn 120 [PLAYER]

I clamp both hands on his gun wrist and drive it up into the corrugated door, grinding the barrel sideways so it can’t line up with my ribs. Then I smash my knee up between his legs and hiss at Rosa, “Brick—pipe—anything, hit his head!”

*Agent reasoning: I can’t out-wrestle a man with a gun, but I can foul the weapon and buy seconds for Niall and Tommy to get up. Rosa’s unarmed, so I need to keep the Saint from turning on her, and also keep us out of the headlights by staying deep in the recess.*

### Turn 121 [GAME]

You get both hands on his gun wrist and ram it up into the corrugated door. The metal bites back with a hollow *BONG* that vibrates through your forearms. The barrel skates sideways, scraping paint, and the Saint snarls as his wrist bends against the angle.

Your knee comes up hard between his legs.

He folds with a strangled, animal sound—air and fight leaving him at once. His revolver-hand goes slack for a heartbeat, and his forehead bumps the door as he doubles. He’s not out, but he’s hurt and off-balance, boots sliding in the wet.

Rosa doesn’t hesitate. She snatches a short length of rusted pipe from the recess—something left behind in the loading bay—and swings two-handed like she’s chopping wood.

The pipe connects with the side of his head with a wet *thock*.

His eyes roll, and he drops straight down, knees first, then collapses onto his shoulder. The revolver clatters on the concrete and skids toward the bay mouth, stopping just short of the rain-slick line of light.

Rosa stands over him for half a second, chest heaving, pipe raised again in case he twitches. Blood runs from his temple into the puddles.

But the gunshot already did its work.

The car’s headlights sweep fully onto the recessed bay now, bleaching the mouth of it white. In the fog beyond the light, you catch the outline of a sedan nosing closer, slow and deliberate, like they’re about to park right in front of you. A door handle clicks somewhere in the glare—someone shifting inside.

Above, the ladder shudders as Niall and Tommy reach the top; you hear the faint metallic rattle of them getting onto the catwalk.

From behind—back the way you came—another Saints voice barks, nearer than before: “He fired! In the bay—move!”

Immediate threats are clear: a car is pulling up and about to disgorge someone into the lit bay mouth, and more Saints are closing in on foot from the warehouse corner. The downed Saint is out of the fight for the moment, but not guaranteed dead.

### Turn 122 [PLAYER]

I snatch the fallen revolver and back into the deepest shadow of the bay, shoving it into Rosa’s good hand. “Up the ladder—now. Don’t argue.”

I raise my empty hand toward the headlights like I’m stepping out to surrender, then tuck in tight and fire one shot low at the sedan’s front tire the moment I see a door start to open. “MOVE!” I bark up at Niall and Tommy, and I start for the ladder right behind Rosa.

*Agent reasoning: We’re about to be lit up by the sedan and pinched by footmen; I need a gun in my hand, get Rosa up, and buy seconds by forcing the car to hesitate while we climb out of the kill zone.*

### Turn 123 [GAME]

You snatch the revolver off the wet concrete and shove it into Rosa’s good hand. For a split second she looks like she might argue out of sheer pride—then she sees the headlights swallowing the bay mouth and she takes it. She holsters it clumsy in her grip and limps for the ladder, boots scraping as she starts up.

You lift your empty hand into the light like you’re about to step out.

The sedan creeps closer, and through the glare you catch movement: the driver-side door latch pops, the door cracking open a few inches.

You tuck in and fire low.

The shot punches into the front tire with a sharp *whap* and an immediate, ugly *hiss*. Rubber collapses fast. The sedan lurches to a stop at an angle, its nose dipping. The driver yelps—more surprise than pain—and the door swings wider as he tries to get out anyway.

“MOVE!” you bark up.

On the catwalk, Niall hauls Tommy by the elbow and they scramble along the eaves into the darkness, metal grating rattling under their feet. Tommy’s breathing is loud, panicked.

The sedan’s interior light flashes on as the driver spills out—Saint in a cap, revolver already in hand. He uses the open door as cover and fires twice into the recess.

One round snaps into the brick above your head, spraying grit. The other slams into the corrugated roll-up door with a shriek that makes your teeth ring.

From the warehouse corner behind you, boots pound closer—at least two men, maybe three. You hear one shout, “Up there! Ladder!”

Rosa is halfway up now, one-handed, dragging herself rung to rung. The revolver you gave her is clenched in her good fist, but she can’t aim while climbing.

You break for the ladder behind her. As you hit the first rungs, the sedan gunman leans out from behind his door, trying to angle a shot upward into the recess. The headlights keep the bay mouth lit, turning the ladder into a bright target.

Clear danger: you’re exposed on the ladder with Rosa above you, a gunman behind the sedan door firing into the recess, and more Saints closing from the rear shouting about the ladder.

### Turn 124 [PLAYER]

I snarl up at Rosa, “Turn and shoot—just once—make him duck!” and I jerk my weight hard side to side on the rungs, trying to set the ladder rattling and spoil the sedan man’s aim. Then I climb fast, keeping my body tight to the wall, and hiss to Niall above, “If there’s anything to drop—crate, chain—drop it on that car door!”

*Agent reasoning: I’m a sitting duck in those headlights; I need to buy Rosa seconds and keep the ladder from becoming a shooting gallery. I don’t have a gun, so I’ll use height and noise—get Rosa to fire from above while I kick the ladder to throw off their aim and scramble up.*

### Turn 125 [GAME]

Rosa pauses two rungs up, teeth bared. She twists her torso around the ladder one-handed—awkward, dangerous—and brings the revolver down toward the bay mouth.

The sedan gunman is half-crouched behind his open door, using it like a shield. As Rosa turns, he catches the movement and snaps a shot up the ladder.

The round punches into the ladder’s side rail with a hard *PING* just below Rosa’s boot. The whole ladder shivers.

Rosa fires once anyway. Her shot goes wide but close—sparks kick off the sedan’s door frame and the gunman flinches back behind cover, instinctively ducking his head and shrinking his profile.

You throw your weight side to side. The ladder rattles violently against its mounts, the rungs buzzing under your palms. It does spoil his aim—but it also makes every movement louder, a metallic clatter that carries.

From the corner behind, one of the approaching Saints answers the noise with certainty: “They’re on it—shoot the ladder!”

A second muzzle flash from below—one of the footmen—cracks, and a bullet smacks the brick beside you, showering dust into your eyes. Another hits the ladder lower down with a ringing *clang*, not cutting it but making your hands sting through the vibration.

You climb hard, body tight to the wall, arms burning.

Up on the catwalk, Niall’s silhouette jerks in the gloom. “Got chain!” he hisses back, voice strained. You hear metal scrape—links dragged over grating—then a heavy, ugly *CHUNK* as something drops.

A length of chain with a hook at the end swings down and slams into the sedan’s open door. The impact dents the door edge and yanks it outward; the gunman stumbles, his cover shifting and the door momentarily pulled off the angle he wanted. He curses—loud, furious—and fires blindly once, the shot going high into the warehouse wall.

Immediate threats: Saints on foot are now actively shooting at the ladder from behind, and the sedan gunman is still armed and recovering his cover. The chain is hanging and swaying—an obstacle and potential tool—but it’s also a clear marker of where you are in the headlights.

### Turn 126 [PLAYER]

I spit the brick dust out and grab the swinging chain with one hand, heaving it hard toward the sedan’s door to tangle his arm and yank his cover again. “Niall—pull it back up! Rosa—keep climbing!”

Then I climb like hell, tight to the wall, and as I near the top I hiss, “When I’m up, we cut left—no heroics, just run.”

*Agent reasoning: The ladder’s turning into a shooting gallery; if I can buy seconds, we live. The chain’s already there—use it to foul the sedan man and block the footmen’s line, then get up and away before the ladder gets chewed apart.*

### Turn 127 [GAME]

You catch the chain one-handed mid-swing. The links bite into your palm, slick with rain and grit, and the sudden weight yanks your shoulder down hard enough your boot slips a rung. For a half-beat you’re hanging by forearms and stubbornness.

You heave anyway—put your whole body into it—and the hook-end whips toward the sedan.

It doesn’t neatly tangle his gun arm. It’s uglier than that.

The hook clips the top edge of the open door and *grabs*. The chain goes taut with a teeth-jarring snap, and the door jerks outward. The Saint behind it is forced to lunge, one hand shooting out to keep his balance. His revolver arm swings wide, exposed.

Rosa, above you, doesn’t stop to look. She just climbs, faster now, boots hammering rungs.

“Niall—pull it back up!” you bark.

Niall braces on the catwalk and hauls. The chain scrapes over the grating, shrieking, and as it tightens it drags the sedan door another few inches—enough that the Saint loses his crouch and stumbles into the headlight beam, fully visible for a second. He snaps a shot upward out of reflex.

The round cracks past your ear and smacks into the brick near the catwalk, showering dust over Niall’s sleeve. He swears and yanks harder.

Behind you, the foot Saints reach the base of the ladder. One of them grabs at the lower rungs and *shoves*—not enough to topple it, but enough to set it bucking. Another fires up the rails again; the bullet punches through a rung two steps below where you just were, splintering wood/metal and leaving a sharp-edged gap.

“You want ’em alive?” a voice snarls from below.

“Not her!” another answers—meaning you, and it lands like a hook in your gut.

You climb like hell, tight to the wall. Your hands find the top edge of the catwalk; you swing a knee over and get up onto the grating beside Niall. Rosa is already limping left, revolver in her good hand now that she’s off the ladder.

Below, the sedan gunman is still fighting the chain and his door, trying to free it; the two Saints at the ladder base start climbing after you, boots ringing on the rungs.

You’re up. Left is open along the catwalk into darker roofline—runable—but you have immediate pursuit coming up the ladder and a gunman below who’s about to get his cover back.

### Turn 128 [PLAYER]

I grab the chain with both hands and stomp my heel against it on the grating, pinning it. “Niall—help me HOLD!” I hiss, then I yank hard to keep it taut and whipping, trying to smash the hook-end down the ladder line into the first climber’s hands.

I snap my head at Rosa. “Go—left, don’t stop!” Then the moment the climber recoils, I let the chain go and bolt after her along the catwalk, keeping low and moving fast into the dark.

*Agent reasoning: They’re coming up the ladder and they want me specifically; I need to buy seconds, not win a shootout. The chain’s already doing work—use it to punish the climbers, then run left with the others.*

### Turn 129 [GAME]

You plant your heel on the chain and haul with both hands. The links grind against the grating and your boot sole, and the tension sings through your arms.

Niall drops into it with you, shoulder and forearms braced. “Hold—hold—” he mutters, face tight.

You snap the chain downward along the ladder line. The hook-end whips like a mean pendulum and catches the first climber—Saint in a flat cap—right across the knuckles as he reaches up.

He howls and his grip breaks. His revolver clatters down the rungs, bouncing and spinning into the recess below. He flails, boots scraping, and drops two rungs hard before catching himself with his forearms, stunned and swearing.

That half-second is all you wanted.

“GO—left!” you bark at Rosa.

Rosa doesn’t argue. She limps into the darkness along the catwalk, shoulders hunched, revolver tight in her fist.

You release the chain and bolt after her, low. Niall peels off right behind you.

The moment you let go, the chain slackens. Down below, the sedan gunman finally wrenches his door free of the hook with a violent jerk. The door swings and slams half-shut, and he immediately uses it again—then angles his revolver up toward the catwalk line.

Two shots crack in quick succession. One punches sparks off the grating behind you; the other smacks into the brick parapet ahead, spraying chips into the dark.

Behind you, the second climber keeps coming, faster now. You can hear him gaining—boots ringing up the ladder, breath ragged, furious: “She’s on the roof—don’t let her get off!”

As you and Rosa push left into the darker run, the catwalk narrows past a roof vent and a sagging section of grating. The vent’s metal housing blocks sightlines for a moment—good for cover, bad for footing. Rosa stumbles once on the uneven grate but catches herself on the rail and keeps moving.

Immediate danger is now a foot pursuit: at least one Saint is about to crest the ladder onto the catwalk behind you, with the sedan gunman firing up from below whenever he gets an angle.

### Turn 130 [PLAYER]

I grab Rosa’s elbow and steer her tight around the vent, hissing, “Eyes on your feet—don’t look back.” At the corner of the vent, I snatch a loose bit of scrap/grating edge and kick at the sagging section to make it give way behind us, then whisper to Niall, “If he pops up, shove him—no bullets.”

*Agent reasoning: Rosa’s hurt and we can’t win a rooftop gunfight; I’ll use the vent as a blind corner to slow the climber, then get us off this narrow catwalk fast.*

### Turn 131 [GAME]

You clamp a hand on Rosa’s elbow and steer her tight around the vent housing. She’s breathing through her teeth, eyes down like you ordered, boots finding the safer line along the rail. “I’m good,” she spits, but she doesn’t look back.

At the vent corner you snatch up a loose strip of metal—more a torn grating flange than a proper bar—and stomp the sagging section with your heel.

It doesn’t collapse cleanly. The first kick makes it *boing* and dip, screaming against its fasteners. The second kick tears one end free with a harsh *RIP*—and the whole section drops a foot, hanging like a sprung trapdoor rather than falling away. It’ll catch a boot, twist an ankle, maybe dump someone if they’re running hard… but it’s still there, half-attached, rattling and obvious.

Niall nods once at your whisper, jaw set. He doesn’t draw—just plants himself on the safe side of the vent, hands open, ready to shove.

The Saint crests the ladder a heartbeat later—flat cap, knuckles red where the chain kissed him, eyes wild. He swings a leg onto the catwalk and lunges after you without thinking.

His boot hits the weakened section.

The grating drops under him and his weight pitches forward. He slams chest-first into the rail with a grunt, one arm plunging down through the gap. He’s not gone—he’s stuck, half-kneeling, scrambling for leverage.

Niall steps in and shoves hard, both palms to the Saint’s shoulder and neck. The man’s balance breaks; he slides, then drops with a yelp as the remaining fastener finally gives. Metal shrieks. The Saint falls out of sight into the darkness below—followed a beat later by the torn grating, clanging as it bounces off something down there.

Immediate consequence: you’ve bought distance—one pursuer is down and likely hurt—but the collapse is loud as a bell. Below, someone shouts, “Up top!” and the sedan gunman’s next shots start walking toward the vent line, trying to find you through sound rather than sight.

### Turn 132 [PLAYER]

I duck low and shove Rosa ahead, “Keep moving—breathe, just one foot after the other.” 

I grab Niall’s sleeve and pull him with us into the darkest stretch past the vent, scanning for a stairwell door or an adjacent roofline we can jump, and I hiss, “No more noise—next shot you hear, we drop flat.”

*Agent reasoning: The noise just painted a target on us; staying near the vent gets us pinned. Rosa’s hurt, so I need cover and a quick exit route—somewhere the headlights and gunman can’t angle up. I also don’t want Niall playing hero and catching a bullet.*

### Turn 133 [GAME]

You keep Rosa moving, palm between her shoulder blades, and she obeys—breathing ragged but steadying, eyes still on the grating. “One foot,” she mutters like she’s counting herself back into her body.

You hook two fingers into Niall’s sleeve and drag him with you into the darker stretch beyond the vent. The light from the yard thins here; the catwalk runs alongside a higher brick wall, and the shadow under the parapet gives you a strip of cover—thin, but real.

Ahead, you spot two options as you move:

- **A metal stairwell bulkhead door** set into the roofline, about twenty feet ahead on your left. It’s the squat kind with a slanted top. There’s a **padlock** on the hasp, but the door is slightly misaligned like it’s been forced before.
- **An adjacent roofline** across a gap to your right—another warehouse roof, lower by maybe three feet. The gap looks **six to eight feet** wide. Doable for someone uninjured. Rosa’s limp makes it a question.

You hiss your rule about noise and dropping flat.

A shot answers you almost immediately—*CRACK*—and you all hit the deck on instinct.

The bullet doesn’t hit you. It **pings off the parapet lip** above your heads and whines away into the night. The sedan gunman is firing blind, using the earlier collapse and your footfalls to guess.

From below, you hear boots and shouting spreading: at least **two more Saints** are moving in the yard now, not just the sedan man. One voice calls, “Find the roof access—cut ’em off!”

Rosa, prone beside you, turns her head just enough to whisper, “Stairs. Please tell me that’s stairs.”

Niall’s breathing is loud in the quiet; he clamps a hand over his own mouth, eyes wide, listening. Another shot doesn’t come right away—meaning the gunman’s either repositioning or reloading, but the men on foot are clearly trying to reach a **different way up**.

### Turn 134 [PLAYER]

I squeeze Rosa’s hand once. “Stairs,” I whisper. “Keep low. On my count.”

I crawl to the bulkhead door and test the padlock and hasp with a careful tug, then jam my scrap of metal into the misaligned seam and lean my weight into it, trying to pop it without a big clang. “Niall—cover her. If you hear boots on metal, we freeze.”

*Agent reasoning: Rosa’s hurt—jumping roofs could kill her. The stairwell is risky with the lock, but it’s cover and a way down; Eve will try force over finesse and keep everyone quiet.*

### Turn 135 [GAME]

You squeeze Rosa’s hand once. She squeezes back—hard, like she’s anchoring herself to the roof.

You belly-crawl to the bulkhead. Up close, the padlock is old and cheap, but the hasp is bolted into the doorframe with thick screws. You give it a careful tug: the lock holds, but the door *does* flex against the frame—the misalignment is real.

You slide the torn strip of metal into the seam near the latch side and lean in slow, putting your weight on it the way you’d ease a stuck window.

For a second it’s almost silent—just metal whispering on metal.

Then the strip bites, slips, and the edge of the door jumps a fraction of an inch with a sharp *tink*.

Not a full clang, but not nothing.

Niall stays back with Rosa, one hand out like he’s holding her in place without touching. He whispers, barely air: “I got her.”

From below and behind, you hear it: boots on metal—distant but distinct—someone has found another ladder or exterior stair and is coming up fast. A voice carries up through the structure: “Roof! Roof!”

Niall freezes instantly, eyes snapping toward the sound. Rosa goes statue-still, face pressed to the grating, trying not to sob-breathe.

You keep pressure on the improvised pry, gentler now. The door gives another hair, enough that you can see darkness through the seam—but the padlock still pins the hasp. You’re not popping the lock this way without either:
- ripping the hasp screws (loud, likely), or
- getting leverage on the lock itself (also likely loud), or
- finding another way in.

The immediate threat is now concrete: at least one Saint is ascending onto the roof from a nearer access point, and he’ll be on the roof within seconds—close enough to see the bulkhead and the three of you if he rounds the parapet line.

### Turn 136 [PLAYER]

I grit my teeth and whisper, “Sorry,” then hook the scrap under the padlock and stomp down hard, trying to shear it or twist the hasp enough to slip it free. 

I glance back at Niall and Rosa. “Soon as it gives—inside, fast and quiet. If he shows, Niall, put him on his back.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re out of time for quiet finesse; I’d rather gamble on one sharp noise than get cornered on the roof. The lock looks cheap—if I can break or twist it fast, we vanish downstairs before they crest.*

### Turn 137 [GAME]

You hook the jagged scrap under the padlock body, brace your boot on the door’s edge for purchase, and stomp down.

The roof answers with a brutal, ringing *CLANG* that slices through the rain like a dinner bell.

The lock doesn’t shear cleanly. Instead, the hasp twists—metal protesting—then one of the frame screws rips halfway out with a squeal. The padlock pops free of the staple on one side and hangs crooked, still attached to the hasp plate. The door jumps outward an inch.

Enough.

But the noise is a flare.

Niall’s head snaps toward the far side of the roof. He pulls Rosa tighter behind the vent line, keeping her low with his forearm. “Stay down,” he breathes at her, then shifts his weight forward, ready to intercept.

A Saint appears at the roof edge near the other access—coat collar up, face slick with rain, a short club in his hand. He sees the bulkhead door move and barks, “HEY—”

You don’t give him the rest of the word. You wrench the bulkhead door with both hands. The twisted hasp scrapes and then tears away with a screech, and the door swings open onto a steep, dark stairwell that smells of rust and wet concrete.

The Saint starts toward you, boots hammering the grating.

Niall surges out of cover and meets him halfway. He doesn’t punch—he rams shoulder-first into the man’s chest. The Saint staggers, tries to bring the club down; Niall catches the wrist, twists, and drives him back into the parapet. The club clatters once—loud—then skitters.

“Inside!” Niall snaps without looking at you, teeth bared as he keeps the Saint pinned.

Rosa crawls, then scrambles, favoring her leg, and slips past you into the stairwell. You’re at the threshold with the door in your hands, the open stairwell yawning below.

Behind Niall, from the yard, a voice shouts up: “They’re at the bulkhead!” Another set of boots hits the metal ladder—someone else is coming.

You have a narrow window: Rosa is in. Niall is engaged. The door is open, but closing it will mean leaving Niall out—or trusting him to follow under pressure.

### Turn 138 [PLAYER]

I grab the fallen club by the handle as I step out of the doorway, swing it low into the Saint’s knee to buckle him, and snap at Niall, “NOW—MOVE!”

As Niall breaks for the bulkhead, I back into the stairwell after him, hauling the door inward and jamming the twisted hasp and my scrap into the gap like a wedge. “Rosa—down, down—don’t stop till you hit the next landing.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m not leaving Niall on the roof—he’s the only thing between us and the Saints. I need to buy him a heartbeat, get him through the door, then jam it shut behind us.*

### Turn 139 [GAME]

The club’s handle is slick with rain, but you get a fistful and swing low.

It connects with the Saint’s knee with a dull, wet *thunk*. His leg buckles sideways and he lets out a sharp, involuntary yelp—more surprise than bravery. Niall uses the instant: he shoves the man off the parapet line and bolts for the bulkhead.

The Saint drops to one knee, one hand clawing at the metal grating, the other reaching blindly for his club—then realizing it’s gone. He snarls, “You—!”

You’re already backing into the stairwell. Niall dives in after you, shoulder clipping the doorframe. You haul the bulkhead door inward; it scrapes on its warped hinge and slams almost shut.

You jam the twisted hasp and your scrap into the gap. It doesn’t “lock,” but it wedges—hard. The door holds with a trembling, metal-on-metal grind.

“Rosa—down, down—don’t stop—” you snap.

Rosa is already half-running, half-falling down the steep steps, one hand on the rail, the other on her ribs. She doesn’t answer—just goes, feet slapping the concrete stairs. You hear her hit the next landing and keep going.

From above, the wounded Saint limps to the door and throws his weight into it.

The wedge holds—barely. The door bows inward a fraction with each hit, vibrating through the frame into your hands and forearms. He shouts, voice close and furious, “OPEN IT! OPEN IT OR I SWEAR—”

Then another sound joins him: boots arriving on the roof access outside, someone else barking, “He’s in the door—get it!”

They start working the bulkhead from the roof side—shoulders, hands, maybe a boot—trying to force it. The wedge buys you seconds, not minutes.

Niall grabs your elbow and yanks you down the stairs. “Move,” he says, breath tight. “They’ll tear that door off.”

As you descend, the stairwell opens into a dim utility corridor below—light leaking from a bare bulb somewhere ahead. The pounding above continues, but muffled now. You can still hear the metal door flexing.

At the bottom landing, Rosa is bent over, trying to breathe quietly. She looks up at you, eyes shining with fear. “Which way?” she whispers.

Behind you, from above, the wedge gives a sharp, warning *squeal*—metal slipping a hair.

### Turn 140 [PLAYER]

I grip Rosa’s arm and point her toward the faint light. “That way—keep your head down and your mouth shut, sweetheart.”  

I press the club into Niall’s hands and murmur, “You’re rear—if that door goes, you slow ’em, then run like hell.”  

Then I creep toward the bulb-lit corridor, eyes sweeping for an office door, a freight elevator, or any sign of a loading bay, and I whisper, “Rosa—can you run if I have to pull you?”

*Agent reasoning: The bulkhead won’t hold; we need distance and a way out. Light ahead means people, but also exits and cover—better than being trapped at the stair. I’ll keep Rosa moving, use Niall as rear guard, and listen for doors/loading bay sounds.*

### Turn 141 [GAME]

Rosa flinches when you take her arm, but she lets you steer her. She nods fast at your instruction, swallowing whatever sound wants to come out.

You shove the Saint’s club into Niall’s hands. He grips it like he’s held one before, knuckles whitening. “Rear,” he repeats, more to himself than you, and backs a step up the stairs to keep eyes on the bulkhead.

Overhead, the pounding turns into coordinated forcing—two bodies at least—then a harsh, metallic *crack* as something gives. Dust sifts down the stairwell.

You start forward toward the faint light. The corridor is concrete and narrow, with sweating pipes along the ceiling and a single bare bulb in a wire cage throwing a sick yellow pool ahead. Your shoes scuff grit and something that smells like old brine and machine oil.

In that light you catch shapes:

- On the right: a small office door, painted gray, with a frosted glass panel. Black stenciled letters read **FOREMAN**. The door is shut.
- Straight ahead: a wider opening into a utility run where the bulb hangs; beyond it, you can hear a slow **drip…drip** and the faint hum of electrical gear.
- On the left: a heavy steel door with a wheel-handle like a ship hatch—chalked with the same surveyor marks you saw upstairs, and that marrow-white key symbol faintly sketched beside it. It’s shut.

Rosa limps after you, trying to keep her steps quiet, one hand pressed to her thigh. When you whisper, “Rosa—can you run if I have to pull you?” she shakes her head once, then forces out, “Not… fast.” She looks up at you, jaw tight. “But I can go. Don’t leave me.”

Behind you, Niall hisses, “Eve—” and you hear him shift his stance.

Up the stairwell, the wedge finally gives with a screeching slide. The bulkhead door slams inward somewhere above, and a Saint’s voice carries down the concrete throat: “DOWN HERE! NOW!”

Niall snaps, loud and sharp: “GO!” Then the first boot thuds onto the top steps.

The threat is immediate and closing: at least two Saints have breached the roof door and are starting down the stairwell toward your corridor.

### Turn 142 [PLAYER]

I grab Rosa and haul her left to the wheel-handled steel hatch, planting my feet and cranking it hard. “Come on, come on—open,” I mutter, then throw a quick look over my shoulder and hiss, “Niall—hit the first one in the throat and fall back, don’t play hero!”

*Agent reasoning: The Saints are on the stairs; we need a barrier and a hiding place. The key-marked hatch feels like the “real” way out, but it might be locked—still worth a desperate try while the foreman’s office could buy seconds and maybe a phone or window.*

### Turn 143 [GAME]

You haul Rosa left; she stumbles, catches herself on the wall, and you shove her shoulder against the cold steel for cover.

You get both hands on the wheel-handle and crank.

It doesn’t budge.

Not even a fraction.

The wheel is seized or locked from the other side—your arms strain, the metal bites into your palms, and the only thing that moves is a faint tremor in the pipework overhead. You try the opposite direction—same result. Solid.

Rosa’s breath comes quick and thin. “It’s—” she starts, then clamps her mouth shut like you told her.

You glance back and hiss at Niall.

He’s already doing what you asked, but the stairwell has narrowed his options. The first Saint comes down hard, club raised, face slick and furious. Niall steps into him—not to brawl, just to interrupt—jabs up with the club’s butt end toward the man’s throat.

It lands with a choking grunt. The Saint staggers, grabbing at his neck.

But the second Saint is right behind him, hand on the rail, and he uses the first man’s stumble like a shield—shoving past, forcing the choke-gasping one sideways into the wall. The second one has a short pistol out, low and ugly in the dim. He doesn’t fire yet—he’s trying not to hit his own man—but he levels it down the steps and barks, “DON’T MOVE!”

Niall freezes for a half-beat, then starts backing down, one step at a time, keeping his body between them and you, club held like he means it. He’s breathing hard. “Eve—hatch’s no good?”

The first Saint coughs and spits, then finds his feet again, eyes watering with rage. “That’s her,” he rasps. “That’s the club girl.”

The pistol Saint advances to the bottom steps. Now you’re in a tight triangle: you and Rosa pinned against the steel hatch that won’t open; Niall a few paces away in the corridor; two Saints at the stairwell mouth—one with a pistol, one with a club and a bad throat—closing the distance.

The pistol Saint’s gaze flicks to the chalked key mark on the hatch and back to you. “Funny door to die in front of,” he says, and raises the muzzle a little higher.

### Turn 144 [PLAYER]

I raise my empty hands slow, stepping half in front of Rosa. “Easy, boys—no need to make a sermon outta this,” I say, voice soft as smoke, eyes on the pistol. “You want the girl? Fine. Let her go—she’s just a limping witness.”

Without looking back, I murmur through my teeth, “Niall… office door. When he blinks.”

Then I tilt my chin at the key mark on the hatch like it’s a joke between us. “You really think I know what that little drawing means? I sing for drunks—I don’t draw maps.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re cornered and that gun will end this fast if I lunge. Eve survives by talking and reading men; buy seconds, shift their attention, and look for a softer exit—office door—while keeping Rosa behind me and giving Niall a cue.*

### Turn 145 [GAME]

Your hands come up slow. You step half in front of Rosa, blocking her with your body.

The pistol Saint doesn’t lower the gun. He lowers his voice instead, like that makes it merciful. “Look at that,” he says to his partner, “she’s got manners.”

The throat-hit Saint swallows hard, winces, and spits again. “Manners don’t mean she ain’t got our paper.” He takes two limping steps into the corridor, club dragging in his fist.

You pitch it soft, offer Rosa like a compromise.

The pistol Saint’s eyes flick to Rosa—then back to you. “We ain’t here for the witness,” he says. “We’re here for what you lifted.” He keeps the muzzle trained center-mass, steady hands. “But—” He jerks his chin. “The limper can go sit in the corner. Quiet. If she runs, she bleeds.”

Rosa starts to edge away from you, terrified but obeying the opening. She limps toward the wall by the foreman’s office door, pressing her back to the concrete, hands up near her chest.

Your murmur to Niall lands. Niall’s eyes cut to the **FOREMAN** door. He shifts his weight like he’s just trying to breathe.

The throat-hit Saint notices the movement and snaps his head toward Niall. “Hey—”

That single distraction is the blink you were waiting for, but it isn’t clean: the pistol Saint doesn’t blink. He tracks Niall with the gun without moving his feet, and the muzzle follows like it’s on a string.

“Don’t,” the pistol Saint says—flat, certain. “You touch that door, I put one in him.”

Niall stops mid-step, jaw tight, club still up. He doesn’t retreat—doesn’t advance. He’s stuck.

The throat-hit Saint closes the remaining distance toward you, eyes wet and furious. He reaches out with his free hand—not to strike, to grab—fingers going for your wrist like you’re a package with a tag.

“Turn your pockets out,” he rasps. “Slow.”

The threat is immediate and explicit: one Saint is within arm’s reach and about to physically search you; the other has a pistol trained on Niall and can shoot if anyone makes for the office door.

### Turn 146 [PLAYER]

I let my shoulders sag like I’m beaten and hold my hands out, palms open. “Alright… alright. Slow,” I murmur, eyes on his face—then I catch his grabbing wrist with both hands and wrench it down and in, slamming my knee up into his groin and yanking him tight against me.  

I press my forearm up under his throat and snarl over his shoulder at the pistol man, “Shoot and you’re baptizin’ your own.”  

“Niall—NOW, office!” I bark, dragging the choking Saint sideways toward the foreman’s door as cover.

*Agent reasoning: I can’t let him search me—whatever I’m carrying will damn us. I’ll play compliant to get his hands where I want them, then turn it ugly fast and use him as a shield from the gun.*

### Turn 147 [GAME]

You sell the surrender well—shoulders dropping, palms open—close enough that the throat-hit Saint commits his weight into the grab.

You trap his wrist with both hands and wrench it down and inward. His elbow buckles; his club-hand jerks uselessly. Your knee drives up hard into his groin.

He makes a wet, strangled sound and folds—then you yank him upright into you before he can collapse, using his pain like a handle. Your forearm snakes up under his throat and you cinch him tight, his heels skidding on the gritty concrete as you drag him sideways.

The pistol Saint reacts instantly: he snaps the gun up, sighting past his partner’s shoulder—then checks himself. The muzzle wavers, hunting for an angle that won’t punch through his own man. “You—” he spits, furious, but he doesn’t fire.

The hostage Saint claws at your forearm, face blotching red, eyes watering. He can’t get air clean; the earlier throat shot makes it worse. His club slips from his fingers and clatters to the floor, ringing in the corridor.

You snarl your warning. It lands—because the pistol Saint’s next move is to shift left, trying to widen his line of fire.

“Niall—NOW, office!” you bark.

Niall moves. Fast. He lunges for the **FOREMAN** door, shoulder-first.

The door doesn’t swing open—it's locked—but the frame is old. His first hit cracks the frosted glass panel with a sharp spiderweb. His second slam caves the glass inward with a crash, and he rams an arm through, fumbling for the inside latch.

The pistol Saint sees the play and commits: he steps laterally, trying to get a clean shot on Niall through the broken glass. He barks, “STOP—” and squeezes off a round.

The shot is deafening in the concrete throat. The bullet punches into the office doorframe near Niall’s shoulder, spitting a chip of wood and plaster into his face. Niall flinches but stays on the latch, teeth bared.

Your hostage bucks, panicking, and his boots scrape for purchase. He manages a hoarse, broken shout around your forearm: “H—HE’S GOT THE—”

The pistol Saint’s eyes flick to you—calculating—then back to Niall, gun still up, ready to fire again the moment he has a line.

Immediate threats:
- The pistol Saint has fired once and is repositioning for another shot at Niall.
- Your hostage is choking and thrashing; if he slips free, you’re exposed in the open corridor.
- The office door is partially breached; Niall is seconds from either popping the latch or getting shot.

### Turn 148 [PLAYER]

I wrench the Saint tighter and drag him hard into the pistol man’s line, his head and shoulders blocking the shot, and I rasp in his ear, “Scream louder, sweetheart—help your friend aim.”  

Then I shout at the gunman, “Drop it and you get him breathin’ again—try for Niall and I’ll crush his windpipe right here!”  

Without waiting to see if he believes me, I heave the choking Saint sideways into the pistol man like a battering ram and lunge after the impact toward the foreman’s door, snapping, “Niall—get it OPEN, now—Rosa, move!”

*Agent reasoning: I can’t outshoot a pistol, so I’ll keep my body shield between him and Niall and force the gunman to hesitate; I’ll use the hostage’s panic to make noise and buy Niall seconds to get that door open, even if it means getting my hands dirty.*

### Turn 149 [GAME]

You haul the choking Saint sideways, forcing his bulk into the pistol man’s sightline. The gunman’s stance shifts again—he has to—because his own partner’s head is now the closest target.

Your rasp in the Saint’s ear makes him panic harder. He doesn’t scream so much as wheeze and gag, clawing at your forearm, eyes bulging.

“Drop it—” you shout, and then you don’t wait.

You heave.

The Saint’s body slams into the pistol man with a meaty impact. The gunman staggers back a half-step, shoulder clipping the stairwell rail; his pistol arm jerks up. Reflex takes over—his finger tightens.

A second shot cracks off.

It goes wild—straight into the ceiling pipe run—sparks spit and a thin jet of water hisses down like a sudden cold rain. The corridor fills with the sharp stink of wet rust and gunpowder.

The collision buys you a heartbeat. You lunge for the foreman’s office door.

Niall is still working the busted panel, arm inside up to the elbow. “I—got—” he grunts, and then the latch finally gives.

The office door swings inward.

“IN!” Niall barks, grabbing your sleeve and yanking you across the threshold.

Behind you, Rosa scrambles—limping fast, nearly falling—then stumbles into the doorway after you, hands up over her head like that’ll stop bullets.

The pistol Saint recovers quicker than you’d like. He shoves his partner off him with a snarl—“GET OFF”—and drives forward, gun coming level again. He doesn’t fire into the office immediately; he snaps his gaze to the doorframe, measuring the angle.

The choking Saint drops to one knee in the corridor, one hand on his throat, sucking air in ragged, high pulls. He’s not out—just hurt and furious.

Inside the foreman’s office: stale cigar smoke, a metal desk, a wall safe half-hidden behind a peeling pin-up calendar, and a rear interior door (solid, unglazed) that likely leads deeper into the warehouse.

Niall shoves the office door toward closed—but it won’t latch clean with the glass shattered and the frame twisted. It hangs mostly shut, leaving a jagged, fist-wide gap at the edge.

Threat, clear and immediate: the pistol Saint is stepping up to that gap with his gun ready; he can shoot through the opening the moment he sees movement. The other Saint is regaining his breath and will be back on his feet in seconds.

### Turn 150 [PLAYER]

I grab the metal desk with both hands and heave it sideways into the office door, ramming it to jam the gap. “Niall—back door, now. Rosa—stay low and stick to me.”

As I shove, I snap a look at the wall safe and hiss, “If it’s already open, we take it—if it ain’t, we don’t die for it,” then I pull Rosa toward the rear interior door and reach for the handle.

*Agent reasoning: That gap is a gun barrel waiting to happen; I need a dirty, fast block and get us out the back before they regroup. If there’s a desk, it’s a shield—if there’s a rear door, it’s our way out.*

### Turn 151 [GAME]

You get both hands under the desk edge and heave. It’s heavier than it looks—solid steel frame, drawers full of paperweight junk—but it slides with a screech that sets your teeth on edge.

You ram it into the office door. The desk corner bites into the warped frame and the door shudders inward, the jagged gap shrinking to a narrow seam. The desk doesn’t “lock” it shut, but it **blocks the line of sight** and forces anyone outside to either shove the desk back or fire blind through wood and metal.

Outside, the pistol Saint steps up and immediately tries to muscle the door. It gives an inch—then stops dead against the desk. He curses, breath sharp. “MOVE THIS—” he barks to his partner in the corridor.

A shot cracks—**not through the seam**, but into the door panel itself, testing. The round thuds into the wood with a splintering smack and ricochets inside the desk cavity with a metallic whine. No one’s hit, but you feel how thin the margin is.

Niall doesn’t argue. He peels off toward the rear interior door, grabbing the knob with both hands.

Rosa stays low like you told her, but her panic makes her clumsy—she bumps your hip as you pull her along, whispering “I can’t— I can’t—” through her teeth.

Your glance at the wall safe catches it clearly: **it’s closed**. Dial intact. No handle hanging loose. Not already open.

You reach the rear door and clamp your fingers around the handle.

It turns—stiff, like it hasn’t been used in months—and the door opens inward onto a narrow utility passage that smells of oil and wet concrete. A bare bulb hangs further down, dim and buzzing.

Behind you, the Saints start their next move: the pistol Saint stops wasting shots and puts his shoulder into the office door. The desk shudders and scrapes a half-inch across the floor.

He’s not in yet—but he’s **coming through**, and now you can hear the second Saint rejoining him, both of them grunting as they lean their weight into it.

### Turn 152 [PLAYER]

I grab Rosa by the forearm and haul her through the rear door, keeping her low. “You can—because you have to,” I hiss, then glance back at Niall. “Last one through kicks that door and runs—don’t play tough.”

*Agent reasoning: The desk won’t hold long and the safe’s a dead dream; I need to get Rosa moving and keep Niall close, and I’d rather flee into the utility passage than get pinned in the office.*

### Turn 153 [GAME]

You clamp Rosa’s forearm and haul her through the rear door. She stumbles on the threshold, nearly goes down, and you catch her by the elbow and force her low, pushing her into the utility passage.

She’s shaking hard, breath coming in little bites. “I can’t—” she starts again.

“You can—because you have to,” you hiss, and she swallows it, eyes wide, moving because your grip won’t let her stop.

You glance back. Niall is half-turned between you and the office, jaw tight, listening to the Saints on the other side of the jammed door. The desk scrapes again—another half-inch—metal screaming against concrete.

Your warning lands. Niall gives you a sharp nod, no bravado in it. “Go. Go.”

He backs through the rear doorway after you, one hand on the doorframe for balance, the other already lifting to swing the rear door.

Behind him, the foreman’s office door buckles with a sudden slam—both Saints hitting it together. The desk jumps, skidding, and the seam at the hinge side opens just enough for a sliver of corridor light to cut in.

A voice barks from the other side, close now, furious: “THE BACK—DON’T LET ’EM—”

Niall doesn’t wait. He kicks the rear door shut with the heel of his boot and throws his weight into it. There’s no lock you can hear catch—just wood on wood and a heavy thud as he braces it with his shoulder.

Then—metallic clatter: the pistol Saint has stopped shoving and is moving, likely to circle or find another way through.

The utility passage ahead runs narrow and straight for about twenty feet before turning left. At that corner, the buzzing bulb throws a weak cone of light over pipes and a low, square opening in the wall—like a crawl access or service hatch—half covered by a loose board.

Immediate threat: the Saints are about to abandon forcing the jammed office door and **reposition**; if they know the building, they can cut you off from another corridor or come through this rear route fast.

### Turn 154 [PLAYER]

I tug Rosa toward the corner light and point her at the low square opening. “In there—on your belly. Don’t argue.”  

I look back at Niall, breath tight. “Give that door ten seconds, then get your pretty head in the hole with us—if they come through, you shoot, not shout.”  

Then I yank the loose board off the hatch and drop to my knees, pushing Rosa through first and sliding in after her, listening for footsteps on the other side.

*Agent reasoning: That loose service hatch is our fastest disappearing act, and I don’t trust the rear door to hold once they circle. Rosa’s panicking, so I need to keep her moving and give Niall a clear job—cover, then follow.*

### Turn 155 [GAME]

You drag Rosa to the corner under the buzzing bulb and point her at the low square opening. Up close it’s a rough service hatch cut into brick—about shoulder-width, maybe two feet off the floor—meant for pipe access. The loose board is only resting there, not nailed.

Rosa starts to protest on instinct, then sees your face and clamps her mouth shut. She drops to her belly and wriggles in, dress snagging on a splinter. She hisses in pain but keeps moving, elbows scraping concrete.

You yank the board away and drop to your knees. The hatch breathes cold air—damp, river-stink, and old lime. You shove Rosa’s heel to get her deeper, then slide in after her, shoulders tight in the narrow opening.

Inside is a cramped crawlspace running parallel to the passage, just high enough to army-crawl. Pipes sweat above you. The floor is gritty and wet; your palms come up black.

Behind you, Niall’s voice is close, controlled. “Ten.” He braces the rear door one last time—then you hear him peel off, boots quick on concrete.

A hard, immediate sound answers: **the rear door gets hit from the other side**—not a shoulder, a kick. The wood booms. Niall isn’t there to take it anymore.

Second impact—heavier. The doorframe cracks with a sharp snap like a rib.

You’re half in the hatch when the pistol Saint’s voice barks from the utility passage: “RIGHT HERE—!”

A third slam and the rear door gives way enough to swing inward several inches, scraping. Light spills into the passage in a bright wedge.

Niall appears at the hatch, dropping fast. He’s got his pistol out, but he doesn’t raise it to shoot—he tucks it close so he can fit. “Move,” he whispers, and shoves himself in behind you, boots kicking the loose board aside.

As he disappears into the crawlspace, a gunshot cracks in the passage—**not aimed, more warning than precision**—and chips brick near the hatch mouth. Dust puffs into your face.

Threat is now immediate and concrete: the Saints have breached the rear door and are in the utility passage; they’ve seen the hatch and are close enough to fire into it.

### Turn 156 [PLAYER]

“Crawl—now, Rosa. Don’t stop for anything,” I hiss, shoving her ankle forward, then I twist back and kick the loose board up into the hatch mouth as best I can to spoil their aim.  

Over my shoulder at Niall, breath burning, “If you got a shot, take it—otherwise move your ass,” and I start army-crawling hard into the dark, keeping my head down and listening for them forcing their way in behind us.

*Agent reasoning: They’ve got the hatch sighted—if we linger, we get pinned and shot. I need to get Rosa moving and put distance fast, but I also want to buy us a breath by denying them a clean angle.*

### Turn 157 [GAME]

Rosa lurches forward when you shove her ankle. She makes a small, strangled sound and then commits—elbows pumping, knees sliding, dress dragging grit. She doesn’t stop again.

You twist in the tight space and kick the loose board up into the hatch mouth. It catches crooked, wedged between brick and pipe, leaving a jagged gap. It’s not a seal, but it **breaks the clean line** into the crawlspace.

A shot cracks immediately after—wood splinters, the board jerks, and a shard skitters down the crawlspace and taps your cheek. The bullet doesn’t come through clean; it thumps into something solid above you with a dull, ringing complaint.

Niall doesn’t take a hero shot. He glances back once, sees the angle, and decides fast. “No line,” he mutters. Then he shoves in behind you, crawling hard, pistol tucked along his forearm so it doesn’t snag.

Behind, boots scrape and pivot in the utility passage. A Saint’s voice, close and furious: “They’re in the goddamn wall—get a light!”

Another voice answers, more cautious: “Don’t crawl in blind—”

Then metal clanks—someone yanks at piping or a bracket near the hatch. The board you wedged shudders as they grab it from outside and start worrying it loose.

You drive forward, head down, forearms burning. The crawlspace goes about ten feet and then narrows slightly where a pipe drops lower; you have to flatten your cheek to the wet grit to slide under it. Rosa makes it through, but she snags—fabric catches—and you hear her gasp as she tears free with a rip.

Behind you, the board finally gets pulled aside with a loud scrape. Light spills in again, thinner now, and you hear the Saints right at the opening.

Concrete threat: they’re about to either **fire into the crawlspace** now that the board is off, or **send someone in** with a light. You can hear a match strike—then a hiss as it dies in the damp—followed by a curse.

### Turn 158 [PLAYER]

“Rosa—keep crawling, don’t you dare freeze,” I whisper-shout, then twist my shoulders just enough to hiss back at Niall, “One shot at the light-hand if he sticks it in—then MOVE.”

I scrape my fingers along the grit till I find a loose chunk of brick or pipe-scale, then whip it back toward the hatch mouth to clatter and draw their flinch, and I shove forward after Rosa, keeping my head low and my body tight to the floor.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to start firing or crawl in; I need to buy seconds and keep Rosa moving without getting Niall killed trying to be brave.*

### Turn 159 [GAME]

Rosa’s crawl stutters for half a second when she hears you—then she forces herself onward, shoulders shaking, breathing loud in the tight space. The rip in her dress keeps catching on grit, but she doesn’t stop to fix it.

You twist enough to murmur to Niall. He gives a terse “Yeah,” and shifts his pistol to a two-finger grip so he can aim one-handed without lifting his whole body.

Your fingers find a jagged bit of pipe-scale—flaky rust and mineral crust. You whip it back.

It clatters off brick at the hatch mouth and skitters out into the utility passage with a sharp, unmistakable *tick-tick*.

Outside, one of the Saints flinches hard enough you hear his boot scrape. “Jesus—” he snaps, then immediately, angry at himself: “Don’t spook—get your light in there!”

A hand appears at the opening with a small pocket torch—electric, not a match this time. The beam stabs into the crawlspace, sweeping low.

Niall fires once.

The shot in the confined space is a hammer-blow. The torch explodes into glass and sparks; the hand jerks back with a choked shout. “Ahh—my—!”

But the muzzle flash gives you away for an instant, and the Saints answer on instinct: two quick shots slam into the brick lip and the pipe above you. One round punches through the pipe’s outer skin with a metallic *ping* and a wet hiss starts—steam or pressurized water venting into the crawlspace, hot and stinging as it sprays in a thin, angry line.

“IN THERE!” the pistol Saint barks. “PUT LEAD DOWN THE HOLE!”

They don’t crawl in yet, but they start firing **blindly** into the crawlspace entrance, trying to rake the first few feet.

You and Rosa are already past the low pipe pinch-point; Niall is just clearing it when the hot spray catches his sleeve. He grunts, jerks his arm in, and crawls faster, teeth clenched.

Immediate threat is now twofold: sporadic gunfire is chewing up the first stretch behind you, and the ruptured pipe is filling the crawlspace with scalding mist that will make breathing and visibility worse the longer you stay inside.

### Turn 160 [PLAYER]

I cough into my sleeve and shove forward, voice raw. “Rosa—eyes on me, keep going, don’t breathe deep.”  

I reach back and grab Niall’s wrist for a second, tugging him close. “You’re bleeding or burned, you tell me now—then save the last rounds for when they crawl in.”  

Then I feel ahead in the dark for any grate, seam, or ladder up—anything that’ll get us out of this wall—and if I find one, I hiss, “Exit—here,” and start working it with my fingers like my life depends on it.

*Agent reasoning: The crawlspace is turning into a boiling, bullet-raked trap; I need to get Rosa moving and find an exit fast, even if it means taking a riskier route.*

### Turn 161 [GAME]

Rosa cranes her head back just enough to catch your shape in the dark. Her eyes are wide, wet with the sting. She nods once—hard—and keeps crawling, taking shorter breaths like you told her, chest tight.

The mist behind you thickens as the ruptured pipe keeps hissing. It’s not a full flood, but it’s a hot, needling spray that turns the air into a scalding fog near the entrance. The Saints’ shots keep snapping and chipping at the brick lip—farther back now, mostly noise and ricochets, but close enough that you hear fragments patter down the crawlspace.

You catch Niall’s wrist and tug him in tight. He answers between clenched teeth, voice low. “Burn. Not blood.” He flexes his hand once like he’s checking he can still use it. “Two rounds left.”

Outside, a Saint barks, “He shot my hand—!” and another voice, colder: “Then don’t reach in again. Get the pry bar. We’ll open the wall.”

Metal scrapes—someone drags something heavy, then a *clang* against brick. They’re not crawling in yet; they’re preparing to **widen the hatch** so they can pour fire and bodies into it.

You push forward, feeling ahead with your fingertips. The crawlspace runs another few yards, then your hand finds a change: a vertical seam in the brickwork with a corroded iron frame—an old maintenance grate set into the wall, flush and painted over a dozen times. It’s held by two slotted screws and a latch that’s been half-fused by rust.

You hiss, “Exit—here,” and start working it.

Your nails scrape paint off. The latch doesn’t give at first. You jam two fingers into the crack and wrench—skin tears, and you feel warm blood smear on iron. On the second heave, the rusted latch *pops* with a small, ugly sound.

The grate swings outward an inch… then catches on something beyond it.

Through the gap you see why: there’s a chain looped across the other side, padlocked—someone secured this access from the outside. Past the chain is a dim basement room with stacked crates and a single bare bulb swaying slightly, like it heard the gunshots through the walls.

Immediate threat: you’ve found an exit, but it’s **locked from the far side**; behind you the Saints are bringing tools to break the hatch wider, and the hot mist is getting worse the longer you stay in the crawlspace.

### Turn 162 [PLAYER]

I press my mouth close to Rosa’s ear. “Keep low. Keep quiet. I’m getting this open—don’t look back.”

I grab the chain through the crack and yank hard, testing the padlock, then wedge my fingers under the grate and try to lever it wider against the frame to pop the chain’s anchor. Over my shoulder to Niall, voice tight: “If I can’t break it—shoot the padlock, close as you can. One clean round.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re boxed in and the Saints are about to pry the other end open; I’m not waiting to be smoked out. I’ll try brute force first—quietly—then use Niall’s last rounds only if we must, and I’ll keep Rosa moving so she doesn’t panic.*

### Turn 163 [GAME]

Rosa shrinks even lower, cheek to grit, arms wrapped tight under her like she can make herself smaller than sound. She doesn’t look back.

You hook the chain with two fingers through the narrow gap and yank. It bites into your knuckles and comes up dead-hard: the padlock holds, and so does the anchor point—bolted into the far-side wall. Whoever chained this did it to keep people *in* or *out* on purpose, not as an afterthought.

You wedge your fingers under the grate and lever it wider. The iron frame groans, flakes of rust raining down. The gap widens another inch—enough to see the chain’s path clearly—but the anchor doesn’t pop. Instead, the grate’s hinge starts to complain: a high, metallic squeal that carries.

Out in the utility passage behind you, the Saints hear it. The tool noise stops for a beat.

“There!” one of them snaps. “They’re close—keep opening it!”

A pry bar bites into the hatch behind you with a brutal *crack* of wood. Light spills farther into the crawlspace, and with it comes a fresh burst of gunfire—three shots, fast. One round punches into the crawlspace wall a few feet behind Niall, spitting brick chips that sting your calf.

Niall crawls up tight behind you, jaw set, trying not to breathe the hot mist drifting forward. “I can do it,” he says, but his burned sleeve is stuck slightly to his forearm where the spray hit; he peels it free with a hiss.

You can’t lever the anchor loose with your hands; the chain is too well set. The only clean options are force (shooting the padlock) or finding a way to reach the lock from the other side.

Niall angles his pistol toward the gap, trying to line up the padlock through the crack without putting his face in the opening. It’s a bad angle—iron grate, chain links, and a swaying bulb beyond.

Danger is immediate and concrete: the Saints are widening the rear hatch and raking the entrance; if Niall fires and misses, the ricochet in this tight space could hit you or Rosa, and the shot will also draw the Saints into a full, committed push into the crawlspace now that they know you’ve found an exit point.

### Turn 164 [PLAYER]

I bare my teeth and grab the chain, yanking it through the crack to pull the padlock as tight and centered as I can. “Rosa—face down, hands over your head,” I snap, then I press my shoulder over her like a shield.  

“Niall,” I hiss, low and sharp, “wait for it to stop swinging—then put it through the lock. Don’t miss.”

*Agent reasoning: Niall’s got only two rounds and a bad angle; I don’t trust a ricochet in this tight space. Better to get the lock closer and steadier—even if it hurts—then have him take the shot while I shield Rosa and keep him from rushing.*

### Turn 165 [GAME]

You yank the chain until your knuckles go white, hauling the padlock tight into the narrowest part of the gap. The links bite and chatter against the grate, then settle—taut, centered, as still as you can make it.

“Rosa—face down, hands over your head.”

Rosa obeys instantly. She folds into the dirt, forearms over her skull. You drop your shoulder over her, the closest thing to cover you can give in a tunnel this tight.

Niall inches the pistol forward, careful not to scrape the barrel on iron. He waits—one breath, two—watching the padlock through the crack. The bare bulb in the room beyond sways once more, then slows.

Behind you, the Saints’ pry bar tears at the hatch again: *CRACK—CRACK.* A voice barks, “Wider! WIDER!” and the hot mist keeps creeping forward, burning your throat with every shallow inhale.

Niall fires.

In the crawlspace, the shot is a concussion. The bullet hits true—metal shrieks, then *snaps*. The padlock jumps, split at the shackle, and the chain slumps loose with a heavy, satisfying clatter onto the basement floor beyond.

But the report is a beacon. Outside, one Saint shouts, sharp with triumph: “They’re right there—MOVE!”

Boots hammer the boards. The hatch behind you is wrenched wider in a final, violent heave, and a wedge of light and gun smoke pours into the crawlspace mouth. You hear a body drop to knees at the opening—someone getting ready to crawl in, pistol-first.

At the grate, with the chain now slack, you can shove it wider. It swings open another foot, enough for a person to squeeze through.

Rosa makes a small, broken sound—half sob, half cough—still face-down. Niall’s breathing is ragged; his burned arm trembles, but he keeps the pistol up, eyes fixed back toward the incoming light.

Immediate threat: the Saints are about to enter the crawlspace from behind and fire down the tunnel at close range. You have an open (but tight) exit into the basement room now, and only a moment before they’re on you.

*Triggered: secret_Ed As I Can_0_e42de4*

### Turn 166 [PLAYER]

I shove the grate wider and grab Rosa by the back of her dress and elbow. “Up—through, now. Don’t think.”  

To Niall, eyes on the widening light behind us: “Last round if you have to—then get your ass through.” I push Rosa into the basement first and scramble after her, kicking the grate toward closing as soon as my hips clear.

*Agent reasoning: We’ve bought a second—standing our ground in a tunnel gets us killed. Rosa’s shaken, Niall’s low on rounds; I need to get them through the grate fast and use the door as a choke point while we find cover.*

### Turn 167 [GAME]

You wrench the grate wide enough to force a body through and haul Rosa by dress-back and elbow. She scrambles like a frightened cat, knees and palms slapping iron, then spills into the basement room on the other side—hard on her shoulder against a crate stack. She bites down a cry, coughing instead.

You follow, hips catching for a half-second on the iron frame. From behind, the crawlspace flashes with a muzzle flare—someone at the hatch fires blind down the tunnel. The round *whangs* off the grate’s edge as you clear it, a hot sting of metal flecking your thigh through the stocking, not deep but sharp.

You kick back at the grate as you land in the basement. It swings toward closed—but not all the way. The hinge is bent from age and your levering; it catches, leaving a hand-width gap.

Niall is still on the crawlspace side for a heartbeat, face ghost-pale in the bulb-light. He fires one shot back into the tunnel—more to make them flinch than to hit—and then lunges through the opening. His burned sleeve snags on the jagged hinge; cloth tears with a wet rip, and he hisses, yanking himself free. He tumbles into the basement on his side, pistol skittering a foot across the concrete.

On the other side of the half-closed grate, you hear boots and a voice close now, right at the opening: “They went through—get that grate—!”

Something slams into the iron from the crawlspace side. The grate shudders in its frame, gap widening slightly as fingers probe for purchase.

In the basement room: stacked crates stenciled with shipping marks, a single bare bulb on a cord, and—ten feet to your left—a steel personnel door with a fresh chalk survey mark near its jamb: a marrow-white key. The door’s handle is down, but you don’t know if it’s locked.

Immediate threat is clear and physical: a Saint is starting to force the grate from the crawlspace side; if they get it open, they’ll be in this room with guns in seconds.

*Triggered: secret_Ed As I Can_0_e42de4*

### Turn 168 [PLAYER]

I lunge for the nearest crate and heave it sideways into the grate, jamming it hard against the frame, then grab Rosa under the arm. “On your feet—door, now.”  

I snatch up Niall’s pistol off the floor and shove it into his chest as I herd him toward the steel door. “Open it—now. If it’s locked, you break it or you pick it, I don’t care which—just move.”

*Agent reasoning: The grate won’t hold and we’re out of bullets; the only chance is to buy seconds by blocking it and get everyone through that steel door fast.*

### Turn 169 [GAME]

You slam your shoulder into the nearest crate stack and wrestle one loose. It’s heavier than it looks—wet wood, nails, and whatever’s inside shifting like ballast. You heave it sideways into the grate.

The crate hits iron with a teeth-rattling *BANG* and wedges hard against the frame. On the other side, the probing fingers vanish. A fist pounds once, then twice—muffled now, angry and frustrated.

“Goddamn—” a man growls through the gap. “Get a bar—!”

The grate shudders as they try again, but the crate holds for the moment. Not forever. You can hear them repositioning, scraping metal on stone in the crawlspace like someone passing a tool forward.

You yank Rosa up under the arm. She’s shaking so badly her knees want to fold, but she gets her feet under her when you drag her forward. “Door,” you snap, and she lurches with you, eyes wide and unfocused.

Niall’s pistol is on the floor where he dropped it. You snatch it up and shove it into his chest. He catches it with his good hand, breath hitching, then nods once—no talk, just motion.

You herd both of them to the steel personnel door with the chalk-marked white key. Up close you see fresh scuffs around the latch—recent use—and a faint line of light at the threshold.

Niall grabs the handle and throws his weight into it.

It doesn’t budge.

“Locked,” he spits, voice tight. He tries again, harder, shoulder into steel. The door answers with a dull *THUNK* and a vibration up his arm, but the latch holds.

Behind you, in the crawlspace wall, the crate shifts a fraction as something pries at the grate. Wood groans. The Saints aren’t in yet—but they’re actively working on it, and you can hear their breathing through the crack.

Rosa clutches your sleeve, whispering, “Eve—please—” like she can’t find the rest of the sentence.

Niall steps back from the door, jaw clenched, eyes flicking around the room for anything—tool, hinge, latch plate—anything he can use before that crate gives.

*Triggered: secret_Ed As I Can_0_e42de4, guard_Ed As I Can_0_9cd6de*

### Turn 170 [PLAYER]

I grab Rosa by the shoulders and squeeze once, hard. “Rosa—look at me. Breathe shallow. If they come through that grate, you run at that door and keep low, understand?”

I spin to the crates, rip at the nearest lid with my fingers until I get purchase, then snatch out anything long and solid—crowbar, iron rod, even a bottle—and shove it into Niall’s hand. “Hinges or latch—pick one and ruin it.”

Then I raise the pistol toward the jammed grate, planting my feet. “I’ll cover. Niall, talk to me—what’s the plan, and how many seconds?”

*Agent reasoning: The grate won’t hold long and the door’s locked; we need a tool fast—something from the crates—to either smash the latch or pry hinges, and keep Rosa from freezing up.*

### Turn 171 [GAME]

Rosa’s eyes snap to yours when you squeeze. She nods too fast, swallowing air like it hurts. “Low,” she whispers, and plants herself near the steel door, hunched, ready to bolt on your word.

You rip at a crate lid. The nails fight you—splinters bite under your fingernails—then the board pops loose with a sharp crack. Inside: straw packing and three long-neck bottles wrapped in paper, plus a length of rust-freckled iron pipe used as a spacer.

You grab the pipe—about two feet, heavy—and shove it into Niall’s good hand.

He doesn’t waste time choosing. He crouches at the latch side and jams the pipe between the door and the frame, trying to lever the latch plate. “Plan is ugly,” he says through his teeth. “We peel the strike plate or we shear the screws. If the frame’s rotten, it gives. If it’s not—”

A hard *SCREEE* cuts him off: metal on metal from the crawlspace. They’ve got a pry bar on the grate now.

The crate you jammed against it jerks an inch. Wood groans like it’s about to split. A voice barks, close and clear through the gap: “On three—HEAVE!”

Niall throws his weight on the pipe. The steel door flexes slightly; the latch side squeals. Nothing opens, but one screw on the strike plate lifts a hair, proud of the wood.

“Ten seconds if they’re strong,” Niall says, breath ragged. “Maybe less.”

You bring the pistol up on the grate gap.

On “three,” the grate slams outward against the crate. The crate holds—but the lid you tore off earlier skitters across the floor, and the crate shifts again. A thin crack opens between crate and frame, just enough for a gun barrel to probe through.

A Saint’s pistol nose appears in the crack, searching for you, wobbling as the man tries to aim blind.

Niall grunts and levers again. The strike plate gives a sharp *POP*—one screw tears out entirely and spins across the concrete.

The threat is immediate: a gun is now pointed into the room through a growing gap, and the crate is losing its wedge. Niall has partially torn the latch hardware but the door is still shut.

*Triggered: secret_Ed As I Can_0_e42de4, guard_Ed As I Can_0_9cd6de*

### Turn 172 [PLAYER]

“Rosa—DOWN. Flat!”

I step in close to the jammed grate, angle the pistol at the crack, and fire once at the barrel/hand through the gap—then immediately kick the crate back into the frame with my heel and backpedal toward Niall. “How many screws left—talk to me!”

*Agent reasoning: That barrel in the gap is the first thing that can kill us; if I can disable the hand or gun, it buys Niall seconds to finish the door. I’ll keep Rosa low and out of the line while I take a close, dirty shot.*

### Turn 173 [GAME]

“Down!” you bark, and Rosa drops like her strings got cut—flat to the concrete, hands over her head, skirt pooled around her knees.

You close the distance to the grate. The crack is narrow, but the pistol barrel is there, nosing in, hunting. You angle your shot and squeeze.

The report is deafening in the low room. Your round punches through the gap and clips metal—*PING*—then meat. The gun jerks back out of sight and a man howls, raw and shocked. His weapon clatters in the crawlspace, followed by frantic shuffling.

But the shot buys you only a blink.

The Saints answer immediately: a second muzzle flashes from the crack and a bullet snaps into the crate wood an inch from your knee, spraying splinters. Another round follows—lower—skipping off the concrete with a nasty whine and ricocheting into the far wall.

You kick the crate hard with your heel, driving it back into the frame. It thuds into place and the crack narrows again, choking off their line of fire. You backpedal, pistol still up, keeping your body between the grate and the others.

At the door, Niall is sweating and furious, pipe wedged into the latch side. He yanks, then slams his shoulder into the steel in the same motion.

“One’s out, two left—” he spits, eyes on the strike plate. “They’re long screws—old wood—if it strips, it strips—”

Behind you, the pry bar scrapes again. The crate shudders as they reset their leverage—more controlled now. A voice, calmer, meaner: “Stop pushing it. Split the box. Ax—bring the ax.”

You hear it: the hollow thump of someone crawling back, then the heavier cadence of boots repositioning in the tunnel.

Niall drives the pipe again. The strike plate bends; another screw squeals as it starts to pull—slow, stubborn.

Rosa stays flat, trembling, eyes squeezed shut.

Threat is escalating: they’ve switched tactics. Instead of forcing the grate, they’re about to chop the crate apart from the crawlspace side, which will remove your jam entirely and reopen a firing lane. The door is still locked, but one more screw is starting to give.

*Triggered: secret_Ed As I Can_0_e42de4, guard_Ed As I Can_0_9cd6de*

### Turn 174 [PLAYER]

I swallow the smoke in my throat and keep the pistol trained on the grate. “Niall—don’t baby it. Rip the damn latch clean, I don’t care if you take the frame with it.”

I drop to one knee by the crate and fire a quick shot through the smallest gap I can find, not to hit pretty—just to make them flinch—then I shove my free hand under the crate’s edge and drag it tighter to the frame. “Rosa—stay flat, and if that door pops, you crawl first.”

*Agent reasoning: The crate won’t hold once they start chopping, so I need to buy seconds and get that door open. I’ll force Niall to commit to ripping the latch while I keep the Saints’ heads down, even if it costs me nerves and bullets.*

### Turn 175 [GAME]

Niall hears the edge in your voice and stops trying to be careful. He repositions the pipe higher, closer to the latch itself, and puts his whole body into it—boot braced, shoulder tight, face twisted with pain and spite.

You drop to a knee at the crate. There’s a hairline gap where wood meets iron. You shove the pistol in as far as it’ll go without losing it and fire.

The shot cracks inside the crawlspace like a drum. You don’t see who it hits, but you get what you wanted: a startled curse and a sudden scramble backward, boots and knees skidding on stone.

Then something answers from deeper in the tunnel—a different sound than a pry bar: the dull, heavy *thunk* of an axe head testing a swing.

You hook your fingers under the crate’s edge and drag. The crate scrapes, nails squealing against the grate frame, and you manage to tighten it back into the corner—your fingertips burning where the wood bites. It’s tighter, but you can feel the crate’s side panel flexing; if they start chopping, it won’t stay a wall for long.

At the door, Niall gives one last savage wrench.

Metal shrieks. The strike plate tears free with a ripping sound that’s half wood, half steel. The door doesn’t swing open clean—its latch side jumps outward an inch, then sticks, caught on a twisted lip of frame.

“Frame’s snagged!” Niall barks, yanking with his good hand. “It’s—come on—”

Rosa, still flat, crawls two inches in panic and freezes, looking to you like she’s waiting for permission to exist.

From the crawlspace: a voice, closer again, controlled and cold. “She’s in there. Don’t rush it.”

Then the axe hits the crate—*WHAM*—and the wood dents inward. Straw puffs out through a split like breath.

Threat is immediate and specific: they’re chopping the crate apart from the tunnel side. Your jam will fail in seconds, and once it does they’ll have a clear opening to shoot through. The steel door is partially freed but caught on broken frame wood; it needs one hard pull or shove to clear before the crate gives.

### Turn 176 [PLAYER]

I lunge to the steel door and slam my shoulder into the latch side, then grab the torn edge and wrench it like I’m trying to rip it off the wall. “Rosa—crawl, NOW—through the crack, don’t stand up!”

I shove my pistol into Niall’s hand as I pull. “You go right behind her—cover the hall. I’m last.”

*Agent reasoning: The crate won’t hold against an axe; the only real chance is forcing the door now. I’m protective of Rosa and I trust Niall’s grit, so I’ll throw my weight into the snagged frame while keeping them moving in order—Rosa first, then Niall, then me.*

### Turn 177 [GAME]

You slam your shoulder into the latch side. Pain blooms down your arm, but the snag in the frame finally gives with a wet, splintering *CRACK*. The steel door swings inward a foot—then two—dragging a torn strip of wood with it like a broken tooth.

Cold, stale air rolls out of the corridor beyond: dust, oil, old paper.

“Move!” you snap.

Rosa doesn’t argue. She scrambles on her elbows and knees, keeping her head low like you ordered, and slips through the opening first, disappearing into the dim utility corridor.

You shove the pistol into Niall’s hand. He catches it clumsy with his injured fingers, winces, then nods once—grim, focused. He ducks through behind Rosa, half-turning immediately to aim down the hall the way you told him, breathing hard as he tries to steady the muzzle.

Behind you, the axe hits again—*WHAM*—and the crate’s side panel caves. Straw and a bottle neck burst through the split. The crate shifts, no longer a solid wedge.

A Saint’s hand punches through the broken wood, grabbing at the grate frame. A face flashes in the gap—cap brim, eyes bright with hate—then a second man crowds behind him with something long and dark: the axe handle.

You’re still in the room, last like you said, one hand on the torn edge of the door, the other empty. The corridor is open, but you’ve bought it with your gun: you don’t have it now.

From the hallway, Niall barks, “Eve—NOW!”

The Saints don’t wait. The grate heaves outward as the crate collapses inward. The opening widens to a fist, then a forearm. A pistol appears again through the wreckage, searching for a target.

Immediate threat: they have a firing lane into the room and are seconds from getting a man through the grate. You have a clear exit through the steel door, but you must cross the room unarmed while a gun is probing for you.

### Turn 178 [PLAYER]

I yank the steel door wider and throw myself behind it, using it as a shield as I crouch low. “Saints!” I shout toward the grate, sharp and venomous. “You want me, come take me—” Then I duck and sprint through the doorway on hands and feet, keeping my head down as I scramble into the corridor after Rosa and Niall.

*Agent reasoning: I’m not dying in a back room for pride; I’ll use the door as cover, make them hesitate, and bolt low. If I can buy a heartbeat for Niall and Rosa, I will.*

### Turn 179 [GAME]

You wrench the steel door wider until its hinges groan, then drop behind it, pressing your shoulder and cheek to cold metal. For a half-second it’s a wall between you and that widening grate.

Your shout snaps across the room. The Saints answer with action, not words.

A pistol barks through the wrecked crate. The first round slams into the steel door with a flat, brutal *CLANG* inches above your head, sending a shiver through the slab into your teeth. A second shot follows—lower—sparks skitter off the bottom edge and bite the concrete near your hand.

They’re aiming at the gap under the door now.

You duck even lower and go. Hands and feet, head tucked, you scramble through the doorway like you’re diving under a closing gate. Another shot cracks—this one catches the torn wooden frame, exploding a splintered chunk that whips past your ear and stings your cheek.

You clear the threshold and spill into the utility corridor, breath ragged, palms scraping gritty concrete. Behind you, the Saints’ voices rise, urgent and close, and the grate gives a final tortured screech as it’s forced wider.

In the corridor, Rosa is already halfway down, crawling then stumbling into a crouched run. Niall is posted just beyond the door, pistol up with both hands, trying to hold the sight picture despite his busted arm.

“Go!” he snaps at you, then fires once down toward the doorway behind you—not at you, but to discourage the first Saint who’s about to push through.

The shot echoes hard in the corridor. A man yells from the room you left—pain and anger—and then you hear boots hitting concrete: at least one Saint is through the grate now, moving fast toward the steel door you just used.

Threat is explicit: one or more Saints are now inside the basement room and closing on the corridor entrance. They have at least one pistol and an axe, and they know exactly which way you fled.

### Turn 180 [PLAYER]

I grab Rosa by the back of her coat and shove her forward. “Keep low—don’t you stop.”

I tug Niall’s sleeve and hiss, “Fall back—one shot, then move, don’t play hero,” and I scan the corridor for the nearest side door, stairwell, or hard corner we can duck around.

*Agent reasoning: I’m unarmed and they’re right behind us; the only thing I can do is buy distance and find a way to break line-of-sight. Niall’s hurt—he can’t be our rear guard for long—so I need to get Rosa moving and find a door, a turn, anything to funnel them.*

### Turn 181 [GAME]

Your fist knots in the back of Rosa’s coat and you shove. She stumbles, catches herself on the wall with her fingertips, then keeps moving—low, fast, breath whistling like she’s trying not to sob. She doesn’t stop again.

You catch Niall’s sleeve and yank him back a step. He flinches at the touch—injured arm—but the message lands. “Yeah,” he spits, jaw clenched. He backs up two short steps, pivots, and squeezes off a single round toward the steel doorway.

The shot punches the corridor with a sharp crack. A split-second later, a Saint’s silhouette fills the doorway behind you—hat brim and shoulders—then jerks back with a barked curse. Not dropped, but checked.

Niall doesn’t admire his work. He retreats, gun still up, moving sideways to keep his eyes on the threat while giving ground.

You scan fast.

Ten feet ahead on the right: a narrow side door with a frosted glass panel stenciled **“FOREMAN”**—its frame scarred, but the knob intact. The door is shut.

Another fifteen feet beyond that: the corridor bends hard left around a concrete corner. Past the corner you can see the bottom of a stairwell—metal steps rising, a bare bulb swinging slightly, throwing a strobe of light.

Behind you, boots slap into the corridor—two sets now, not one. One voice calls, “Down the hall!” Another answers, “Don’t shoot your own—”

A pistol muzzle flashes from the doorway. The round hits the corridor wall just above Niall’s shoulder, showering dust and plaster.

Immediate threat: two Saints are advancing into the corridor with at least one pistol, firing down the hall. You have a side office door close enough to grab, and a hard corner plus stairwell farther ahead that could break their line of sight if you reach it.

*Triggered: secret_Ed As I Can_0_e42de4, guard_Ed As I Can_0_9cd6de*

### Turn 182 [PLAYER]

“Forget that door—keep moving!” I hiss, shoving Rosa ahead harder as I herd her toward the left bend.

I grab a fistful of Niall’s coat and haul him with me. “Back to the corner—then up the stairs, quick as you can.” At the bend I drop low and flatten against the wall, listening for their boots and waiting to bolt the instant the line of fire breaks.

*Agent reasoning: The corner and stairwell are our best chance to break their line of sight; stopping to fiddle with the Foreman door could get us pinned in a dead-end office. I’ll keep Rosa moving and use the corner as cover, buying us seconds with noise and urgency rather than heroics.*

### Turn 183 [GAME]

You drive Rosa forward and she shoots around the left bend first, shoulders hunched, one hand skimming the wall to keep balance. Niall comes with you, dragged more than guided—his boots scuffing as he tries not to jolt his bad arm.

The instant you hit the corner you drop and flatten to the concrete, cheek near the grit, listening.

The gunfire line breaks the moment you’re out of sight. The corridor behind you fills with hard, fast footfalls—then a Saint barks, “Corner—corner!”

A shot cracks anyway, blind-fired. It smacks the concrete edge above you with a sharp *PING* and spits stone dust into your hair. Too close, but it doesn’t tag you.

Rosa is already at the base of the stairwell ahead—metal steps bolted into the wall, climbing into a dim rectangle of light. She starts up on hands and feet, skirt snagging on a tread. She yanks it free and keeps going.

Niall reaches the first step and hesitates half a beat, trying to climb one-handed while keeping the pistol up. His breathing turns ugly with pain. He looks back over his shoulder at you, eyes wide.

From behind the corner, the Saints’ boots close in—now clearly three men by the rhythm, one heavier than the others. One of them laughs once, short and mean. “Got you penned, songbird.”

Then a new sound cuts under it: a metallic rattle from above—like a chain being drawn, or a latch being worked at the top of the stairwell.

Someone up there is moving the door.

If that door gets shut or barred, you’ll be trapped on the stairs with Saints coming from below. If it opens, whoever’s up there will see you first—friend or not.

*Triggered: secret_Ed As I Can_0_e42de4, guard_Ed As I Can_0_9cd6de*

### Turn 184 [PLAYER]

I grab the stair rail and hiss up through my teeth, “Hey—whoever’s up there—don’t you lock that door! It’s Eve Marlowe, and I’m coming up with company you don’t want!”

Then I shove Niall up a step with my shoulder. “Move, damn you—keep that pistol pointed down.” I snatch a loose bit of rubble and whip it back around the corner hard, like I’m tossing a grenade, and dart onto the first steps right behind him.

*Agent reasoning: We can’t get bottled on the stairs; I need to force that top door decision—either ally opens or enemy reveals themselves—while buying Niall and Rosa seconds. I’m unarmed, but I can still bluff and make noise to control the moment.*

### Turn 185 [GAME]

Your voice knifes up the stairwell, raw and tight. “Eve Marlowe—don’t you lock that door!”

Up top, the rattling stops dead.

A beat later, a man’s voice answers—close enough to carry, not close enough to see. “Marlowe?” Suspicion, and a quick edge of recognition. “You alone?”

You slam your shoulder into Niall and he lurches up a step, jaw clenched so hard it looks like it might crack. He keeps the pistol angled down the stairwell like you told him, but his wrist tremors with the effort.

You scoop a jagged chunk of concrete from the stairwell edge and whip it back around the corner. It clatters and skitters loudly down the corridor floor, striking the wall with a sharp *KRAK* like something heavier than it is.

The Saints react exactly the way you want for half a second.

“Jesus—!” one of them yelps, and their boots stutter. Another barks, “It’s not— it’s a rock, you idiot—!”

That half-second buys you two steps.

Then the heavier Saint commits. Boots hammer the corner and a broad shape leans into the bend, pistol outstretched. He fires up the stairwell on instinct.

The round slams into the metal rail beside your hand with a vicious *SMACK*, tearing a bright chip of steel and vibrating the whole railing. Your fingers go numb from the shock, but you’re not hit.

Niall answers with one shot downward. The muzzle flash lights his face. The Saint at the corner jerks back with a grunt—hit or grazed, you can’t tell—then disappears from view, replaced by another man’s shoulder as they crowd for the angle.

Above, the door at the top of the stairs opens a crack. Light spills down in a thin wedge. A face appears in it—pale, sweating, hair slicked back—Tommy Coyle’s, eyes wide and feral.

He’s not holding a gun. He’s holding the door with both hands like it weighs a ton.

“Eve,” he says, voice breaking. “Hurry. They’ll—” A shout from somewhere above him cuts him off, and Tommy flinches like someone just yanked a chain attached to his ribs.

Threat is immediate and specific: Saints are at the stairwell corner firing up; at least one is willing to shoot blindly. The top door is open only a crack and Tommy is being pressured by someone above to close it.

*Triggered: secret_Ed As I Can_0_e42de4, guard_Ed As I Can_0_9cd6de*

### Turn 186 [PLAYER]

I snap up at Tommy, “Tommy—open it WIDER, now! Tell whoever’s got you: if that door shuts, I swear I’ll sing their name to every copper on the docks.”

Then I lean down the stairs and bark toward the corner, “You Saints keep firing and you’ll hit your own—there’s three of you stacked like cheap suits!” I grab Niall by the back of his coat and haul him up another step. “Rosa—GO, keep climbing—don’t look back.”

*Agent reasoning: Tommy’s our only way through, but someone’s forcing his hand; we need that door fully open and we need the Saints’ angle broken long enough to get Rosa and Niall through. I’ll bluff leverage on whoever’s above and buy seconds by making the Saints hesitate with a threat.*

### Turn 187 [GAME]

“Tommy—open it wider, now!”

Tommy’s hands tremble on the door edge. He swallows hard, then forces it another few inches. The wedge of light broadens, spilling down the stairs and catching Rosa’s face as she climbs—eyes blown wide, mascara streaking.

From above Tommy, a second voice snaps, tight and controlled: “Shut it. Now.” You don’t see the speaker, only a shadow crossing behind him.

Tommy flinches, but your threat lands. He blurts upward, fast and desperate: “She’ll talk to the cops—she knows names—” His voice cracks on the last word.

The unseen person above answers with a low, cold laugh. “So do we.”

Down below, you bark at the Saints about their stack. For a moment, it works: their firing stops, replaced by angry, hurried shuffling as they try to spread out.

Then the heavy one at the corner snarls, “Don’t listen to her—MOVE!” He doesn’t fire again—he advances.

A hand appears around the bend, not with a pistol but with a squat bottle. The bottle arcs up toward the stairwell, rag stuffed in its mouth burning bright.

It hits two steps below you and bursts.

Flame blooms across the metal treads with a wet *WHOOMPH*, licking up fast—cheap spirits and oil. Heat punches your shins. Smoke curls up the stairwell, harsh and sweet, and the fire starts climbing the steps toward you, fed by the spill running downhill.

You haul Niall up another step; he nearly goes down on his knee, catches himself, and keeps climbing, teeth bared. Rosa doesn’t stop—she scrambles higher, coughing as the first smoke reaches her.

Above, Tommy yanks the door wider—now open enough for one person to squeeze through at a time—but he’s losing leverage. Something tugs him from behind, and his shoulders jerk back as if someone’s grabbed his belt.

Threats now: fire is spreading up from below, cutting off retreat and forcing you upward fast; Saints are closing the bend behind the flames; and someone above is physically pulling Tommy away from the door, risking it slamming shut again before you reach it.

### Turn 188 [PLAYER]

I rip off my scarf and slap it over my mouth and nose, then yank my flask free and splash what’s left down onto the burning steps to knock the flame back just enough to climb. “Rosa—through the door, now! Tommy—HOLD IT!” I hook my arm under Niall’s good side and half-drag, half-shove him up, and as I pass the door I snap my free hand out to grab Tommy’s wrist and haul him toward us.

*Agent reasoning: Fire’s eating the stairs and that door’s about to slam; I need to get Rosa through, keep Niall moving, and buy one breath of time by choking the flames or at least making the Saints hesitate.*

### Turn 189 [GAME]

You clamp the scarf over your mouth and nose and it helps—smoke still burns your eyes, but you can breathe without gagging.

You whip the flask out and splash what’s left onto the nearest tongues of flame. The alcohol doesn’t smother it—if anything, it flares for an instant, a bright hungry lick that crawls sideways across the spill. But the liquid also breaks up the pooled fuel on two steps, thinning it just enough that the fire stutters there instead of rolling solid.

It buys you a narrow, ugly path: hot metal, patchy flame, and a lot of smoke.

“Rosa—through the door, now!”

Rosa hits the top, shoulders first, and squeezes through the crack. Inside, she stumbles and falls out of sight with a yelp.

You get Niall up the last few steps by brute force—his good side under your arm, his boots scraping. He’s coughing hard now, pistol still in his hand but lowered, more dead weight than threat.

At the doorway, you snap your hand out and catch Tommy’s wrist.

You feel the answer immediately: a violent tug from above yanks him the other way. Tommy’s skin is slick with sweat; your grip almost slips. He cries out, “Eve—!”

You plant your heel on the top step and haul. For half a second it’s a rope pull—your shoulder screams, Niall lurches into you, and the scarf shifts, letting smoke bite your throat.

Then Tommy comes free—hard.

He stumbles into the stairwell and collides with you and Niall in a three-body knot at the threshold. The door swings wider with the sudden release—

—and a hand from inside slams it inward, trying to close it on you.

The edge catches Niall across the shoulder and spins him sideways with a pained grunt. His pistol clatters once against the doorframe but doesn’t drop.

Through the widening gap, you finally see the one who tried to take Tommy: a Vice Bureau officer in shirtsleeves, tie loose, badge chain glinting at his belt. His face is soot-smudged, eyes hard, and he’s got a revolver up at chest height.

He snaps, “Nobody else comes through.”

Below you, the Saints shout through the smoke—closer now—and the fire is still climbing, feeding on the spill you didn’t fully break. You’ve got seconds before the stairwell becomes a chimney.

### Turn 190 [PLAYER]

I shove my shoulder into the door to keep it from closing and glare straight at the Vice man. “Then quit pointing that thing at me and help—unless you want three Saints and a fire in your lap.”

I hook my arm around Niall’s coat and drag him through the gap, then snatch Tommy by the collar and yank him inside after us. “Rosa—find me something heavy to bar this damn door!”

*Agent reasoning: The stairwell’s turning into an oven and the Saints are right there; arguing won’t stop a bullet. I need that door open now, and the quickest lever is the cop’s fear of a mess and my willingness to make one.*

### Turn 191 [GAME]

Your shoulder hits the door and stops it mid-swing. The Vice man’s revolver wavers an inch, then steadies again—more from habit than intent. He looks past you, down the stairwell, and the orange pulse of the fire reflects in his eyes.

“Saints?” he spits, like the word tastes bad. Another beat, and he makes a decision he’ll hate later: he drops the muzzle and reaches for the door edge with his free hand. “Move, then.”

You hook Niall by the coat and drag. Niall stumbles through the gap, half-falling onto the floorboards inside. He lands hard on his hip and hisses through his teeth, smoke cough turning wet. The room you’ve entered isn’t an office—it’s a narrow utility space off the roof bulkhead: tar-papered walls, a mop sink, a coil of hose, a metal shelving unit with paint cans and rags. One small window is painted over from the inside.

Tommy comes next—your fist in his collar. He trips over Niall’s legs and scrambles upright, wide-eyed, staring at the Vice man like he’s seeing a ghost.

Rosa, already inside, is on her hands and knees near the shelving, hacking coughs into her sleeve. At your bark she pushes up, frantic, and starts yanking at whatever she can reach. A paint can clatters. A bundle of rags spills. She grabs a squat iron valve wheel off a shelf—heavy but awkward—and drags it toward the door.

The Vice man braces the door with you, then glances down at your hands and Niall and Tommy in a quick tally. “That’s it,” he says, voice flat. “Door shuts after—”

A gunshot cracks from the stairwell below—close enough to make the painted window vibrate. Then a Saint’s voice, hoarse through smoke: “UP THERE! SHE WENT UP!”

Heat and smoke surge into the doorway gap as the stairwell turns into a draft. The fire isn’t just below anymore—you can see flame licking the underside of the top landing through the crack, trying to climb into this room.

Rosa reaches you with the valve wheel. “This—this heavy enough?”

The immediate threat is the Saints reaching the top of the stairwell in seconds, with smoke and fire pushing them upward and into you if the door isn’t sealed and barred.

### Turn 192 [PLAYER]

“Yeah—jam it in, NOW.” I snatch the valve wheel from Rosa and slam it down at the base of the door as a wedge, then shove my weight into the door until it bites tight. 

I bark at the Vice man, “Put your shoulder on it—unless you’re planning to arrest a bonfire,” and kick the hose coil loose with my heel. “Rosa, wrap that hose around the handle if there is one—anything to keep it from giving.” 

Over my shoulder I snap at Niall, “Get up—back from the door. If it bursts open, shoot low and don’t hit me.”

*Agent reasoning: We need that door shut and sealed immediately or the Saints and fire pour in; I’ll use the valve wheel as a wedge/bar and the hose as backup, while keeping the Vice man committed and getting Rosa/Niall away from the choke point.*

### Turn 193 [GAME]

You rip the valve wheel from Rosa and slam it down into the gap at the base of the door. It bites—metal on wood—then skitters a half-inch as the door shudders from a hit on the other side. You throw your weight forward and grind it in again until it wedges tight enough to hold.

The Vice man hesitates at your order, jaw working like he’s swallowing pride. Then he steps in and plants his shoulder beside yours. “If this goes bad,” he mutters, “it’s on you.” He leans hard.

The door bucks—once, twice—heavy bodies on the stairwell side. A Saints voice snarls through the crack, close and muffled: “Kick it! KICK—”

A third impact hits higher, near the latch. The frame creaks; dust shakes loose from the tar-paper seam. The valve wheel holds, but it’s not pretty—every shove makes it grind and threaten to spit out.

You kick the hose coil loose. It unspools across the floor with a rubbery slap.

Rosa darts in, coughing, and finds the handle—a simple metal pull. She loops the hose around it and then around a short pipe riser by the mop sink, cinching it like a tourniquet. “Hold—hold—” she gasps, yanking until her knuckles whiten. The hose stretches but doesn’t snap.

Niall drags himself backward on his elbows, then gets a knee under him. He brings his pistol up two-handed, barrel angled toward the bottom hinge line like you said—low, ready, shaking from pain and smoke. “I’m up,” he wheezes. “Just—don’t let them—”

On the other side, the fire finally finds the gap. Smoke pours in around the jamb in a solid stream, and a thin orange lick curls under the door, tasting the utility room floor. The heat coming through is immediate—like an oven door cracked open.

Then something changes: the pounding stops for half a heartbeat, replaced by hurried shouting and a scrape like someone dragging something metal up the stairwell.

The Vice man’s eyes flick to you. “They’re not kicking anymore,” he says, low. “They’re bringing a tool.”

*Triggered: secret_Ed As I Can_0_e42de4, guard_Ed As I Can_0_9cd6de, watcher_Ed As I Can_0_ccf26f*

### Turn 194 [PLAYER]

I peel off the door long enough to scan the room—window, ceiling, anything. “Tool means they’re coming through. Where’s this lead—roof? Another exit?”  

I grab the hose near the sink and twist the tap, trying to get water running; if it spits even a little, I aim it low at the door crack to kill that licking flame. “Rosa—help me with the hose. Niall—if you see metal bite the latch, put two rounds through the hinge line.”  

Then I lean in close to the Vice man, voice like a threat and a plea at once. “You want to pin this on me later, fine—right now you’re our way out. You got keys? A way to the roof?”

*Agent reasoning: A tool means they’ll pry the latch or chop hinges; holding the door will fail. Eve’s a survivor—she’ll pivot to escape routes, use the hose/water if possible, and try to turn the Vice into a reluctant ally while keeping Rosa moving and Niall ready.*

### Turn 195 [GAME]

You peel off the door and sweep the utility room with a fast, desperate look.

There’s a ceiling hatch panel—painted shut, with old pry marks—set between two joists. The painted-over window is small, wired glass, and the paint is thick enough you can’t see through it. The only other way out you can spot is the bulkhead door you came in through… which leads back onto the roof.

You twist the mop-sink tap.

Nothing.

It gives a dry metallic squeal and spits a single brown cough of air that smells like rust, then goes dead. No pressure. Either the line’s cut, the building’s feed is shut, or the whole place is running off a tank that’s already empty.

The flame under the door keeps licking in, thin and persistent, fed by the draft. Smoke is worse now—your scarf helps, but your eyes water hard.

Rosa grabs the hose anyway and helps you aim it at the crack on instinct. It’s just rubber in your hands—no water, no weight. “It’s dead,” she says, voice breaking. “No water—Eve—”

On the other side of the door: metal bites wood. A harsh scraping, then a thunk-thunk like a pry bar testing purchase at the latch. The hose loop around the handle tightens and creaks as the door flexes.

Niall shifts, shoulders squared despite the pain, and aims low like you told him. “I see it,” he rasps. He doesn’t fire yet—waiting for a clean angle through the gap.

You lean in on the Vice man.

He answers without looking at you, eyes locked on the door seam. “Keys, yeah.” He pats his pocket like it’s still there. “Roof’s out that bulkhead. But the roof’s not empty.”

Another hard pry. The latch side of the door bows inward a fraction. The valve wheel wedge shudders.

The Vice man finally turns his head enough to meet your stare. “You want out? We go up. But if I open that bulkhead, somebody up there will hear it. And if the Saints don’t get us, the Bureau will.”

A sharp crack—wood fibers giving at the latch—telegraphs the next pry will open a gap big enough for a hand, then a gun.

The immediate threat is the Saints forcing the latch within seconds.

### Turn 196 [PLAYER]

“Alright—roof, then. But you go first, Officer: you open it, you listen, you eat the first bullet if your friends are up there.”

I grab a paint can off the shelf and shove it into Rosa’s hands. “On my mark, smash it at the door—make a mess, slow their feet.” Then I nod to Niall. “Now—two rounds. Low. Ruin that pry bar hand.”

As the shots go, I hook my arm around Tommy’s collar again and drag him toward the bulkhead door, pressing close to the Vice man. “Keys out. Open it quiet, and if you double-cross me, I’ll make sure the Saints don’t miss.”

*Agent reasoning: The door won’t hold and we’ve got no water; the roof is risky but it’s movement. I’m not letting the Vice man steer me into a trap, so I’ll force him to lead while we prep a distraction and buy a second with Niall’s shots.*

### Turn 197 [GAME]

The Vice man’s mouth tightens at your terms, but he nods once—short, angry. He pulls a ring of keys from his pocket, already half-crouched by the bulkhead door to keep his silhouette low.

You shove the paint can into Rosa’s hands. It’s a gallon can—heavy. She almost drops it, catches it against her hip, and coughs out, “On your mark.”

Niall takes your nod like permission he’s been begging for. He fires twice.

The first shot cracks so loud in the tiny room your ears ring. The second comes a heartbeat later. Both rounds go low, through the bottom panel of the door near the hinge line. Splinters jump. On the other side, there’s a sharp yelp—more surprise than agony—and the pry-scrape stops abruptly.

A metal bar clatters down the stairwell steps.

Then a voice—different than before, higher—shouts, “He’s shooting through! Back—BACK!”

The door doesn’t open, but the pressure against it returns as a shoulder hits it once, testing. The valve wheel wedge holds. The hose loop creaks, stretched tight around the handle.

You hook Tommy by the collar and haul him toward the bulkhead. He stumbles, wheezing, eyes wild, but he goes.

At the bulkhead, the Vice man fits a key into the lock. He tries to turn it slow.

The lock resists—stiff with weather and grit. The key scrapes metal, loud in your ears because everything else has gone suddenly quiet except the fire’s hungry hiss.

Up on the roof side, someone answers that scrape with a soft, unmistakable sound: a shoe scuffing on gravel-tar, close to the door.

A man’s voice, calm and bored, calls through the bulkhead from outside: “Vice? That you in there?”

The Vice man freezes with the key half-turned, eyes flicking to you.

Behind you, the stairwell side goes from prying to planning: you hear hurried footsteps retreating down a few steps, then the wet glug of something being poured, followed by a match-strike hiss.

Rosa, clutching the paint can, whispers, “They’re… they’re lighting it.”

Immediate threats:
- On the stairwell side, the Saints are about to feed accelerant into the doorway/fire, which will turn this room into a blowtorch.
- On the roof side, someone is posted right outside the bulkhead and has identified the Vice man by voice.

### Turn 198 [PLAYER]

I lean close to the bulkhead and pitch my voice rough and official, trying to mimic the Vice man’s cadence. “Yeah—open up, you idiot, we’ve got smoke and Saints on the stair!”

Then I grab the Vice man by his tie and yank him tight to the door, hissing, “Turn it—NOW,” and as soon as it clicks I drive my shoulder into the bulkhead to burst it outward, using him like cover while I shove Tommy and Rosa through first. “Move, move—Rosa, paint can ready—if he’s there, you swing.”

*Agent reasoning: Fire’s about to turn this room into an oven, so we can’t stay; the roof guard recognizing the Vice means we need deception and speed, and I’ll risk a messy shove to buy seconds.*

### Turn 200 [PLAYER]

I press my mouth to the bulkhead and bark in my best clipped-cop tone, “Yeah—open it, we’ve got smoke and Saints on the stair!”  

Then I fist the Vice man’s tie and haul him close. “Turn the key—now,” I hiss, and the second it gives I slam the bulkhead outward and shove Tommy through first, then Rosa with the paint can raised like a club. “Go—move!”

*Agent reasoning: Something glitched; I’ll repeat the last move but simplify it and make sure we act fast before the Saints light us up.*

### Turn 201 [GAME]

Your bark through the bulkhead lands—there’s a half-beat of hesitation outside, like the man is deciding whether to believe you.

The Vice man’s hand shakes once on the key. You yank his tie tight enough to choke off argument.

The lock finally gives with a gritty click.

You drive your shoulder into the bulkhead and it bursts outward—hard—slamming into something solid on the other side.

A man grunts and staggers back. He’d been posted close, ear near the seam. He isn’t in uniform—dock coat, flat cap—but he’s got a Bureau-style shoulder holster under it, and his pistol is already halfway out when the door hits him.

You shove Tommy through first. Tommy tumbles onto the roof gravel, catching himself on his palms, coughing so hard he nearly vomits.

Rosa comes next, paint can raised. She swings on instinct at the shape in front of her.

The can connects with the man’s forearm and the side of his jaw in a single ugly arc. Metal rings. He cries out, gun hand jerking wide; the pistol goes off once—

The shot cracks into the bulkhead frame above your head, showering splinters and tar grit down onto your hair and shoulders.

The man stumbles, trying to bring the gun back on line. He’s dazed, not down.

The Vice man lurches forward into the doorway as you use him for cover, and the roof air hits you like a slap—cold, wet, and clean compared to the smoke behind.

But the roof isn’t empty.

To your left, near a low vent stack, a second figure rises from a crouch—this one in a dark rain cape, rifle leveled, watching the doorway like he’s been waiting for the exact moment it opens. He doesn’t fire yet; he tracks the movement, controlled.

From behind you, the stairwell side flares: the Saints’ accelerant catches. A sudden whoof of orange light blooms under the utility-room door, and heat punches through the bulkhead opening at your back. The room you just left starts to roar.

Threats, immediate and concrete:
- On the roof: one armed man (pistol) is wounded/dazed but still up at arm’s length; a second man has a rifle trained on the doorway and is steady.
- Behind you: the utility room is about to become untenable as the fire surges; staying in the threshold will cook you and cut off retreat in seconds.

### Turn 202 [PLAYER]

I lunge for the dazed pistol man, hooking an arm around his throat and yanking him in front of me, my other hand clamping his gun wrist down. “Rifle—EASY! You squeeze, you kill your own man.”

Over his shoulder I snap at Rosa and Tommy, “Get left—vent stack, now! Low!” Then I bark at the Vice man through clenched teeth, “Tell him to stand down—tell him or I walk this one right into your line of fire.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re trapped between a rifle and a fire; talking buys a second, but I need the rifleman’s muzzle off us. The lookout with the pistol is close enough to use as a shield, ugly as that is. I’ll also get Rosa and Tommy moving away from the doorway so one burst doesn’t drop us all.*

### Turn 203 [GAME]

You hit the dazed pistol man before he can reset his feet. Your forearm snakes under his chin and you haul him back into you; his breath barks once, then turns into a strangled rasp. Your other hand clamps his gun wrist down hard against his ribs. The pistol’s muzzle points uselessly at tar and gravel.

The rifleman by the vent stack reacts on training: the rifle comes up tighter, cheek welded to stock. But he doesn’t fire—because you’ve put his line through his own man’s spine.

“Easy,” you warn.

He answers without moving his aim. “Let him go.” Flat, controlled. No panic—like he’s done this in alleys before.

Rosa and Tommy scramble left when you snap at them. Tommy crawls, coughing, dragging a knee that doesn’t want to bend. Rosa stays low, paint can hugged to her chest now, eyes huge as she scoots behind the vent stack.

The Vice man hesitates in the bulkhead mouth, heat washing over him from behind. The fire inside surges again; the doorway vomits smoke and a lick of orange that curls up the bulkhead frame. He flinches like it burned his eyelashes.

You bark at him to talk the rifle down.

The Vice man swallows, then forces his voice out toward the rifleman: “Eddie—hold it! Don’t shoot!”

The rifleman’s muzzle shifts a fraction—not lowering, just adjusting—so it’s still on you but no longer pinned to the hostage’s head. “That ain’t Vice,” he says. “That’s the Lark girl.”

Your hostage bucks once, trying to stomp your foot and peel your arm. You tighten; his face purples at the edges, and his pistol hand spasms against your grip.

From the bulkhead behind you comes a sharp, wet crack—wood giving way—followed by a rush of flame that punches outward. The utility-room interior is starting to flash; the threshold is becoming a chimney.

The rifleman glances once at the growing firelight and makes a decision. He raises his voice, not to you—to someone farther off on the roofline: “Crowe! It’s her—she’s got a man!”

A woman’s voice answers from the darkness beyond the vent stacks—closer than you’d like, amused and cold: “I heard.”

Now you’ve got:
- a rifle trained on you at mid-range,
- a hostage thrashing in your arms,
- fire behind you cutting off the bulkhead fast,
- and someone named Crowe closing in on the roof.

### Turn 204 [PLAYER]

I clamp down harder, dragging the hostage sideways toward the vent stack, keeping his spine square in the rifle’s line. “Eddie—if Crowe wants me so bad, she can come take me herself. You shoot, you’re burying your pal for her.”

I shout over my shoulder, “Rosa—Tommy—keep crawling, find the next hatch or stair, don’t look back!” Then, to the Vice man, eyes cutting like a razor: “Get off that damn doorway before you catch, and tell me where this roof goes—other stairs, ladder, anything—NOW.”

*Agent reasoning: The fire is about to cut us off, and a rifle plus this Crowe means we’re seconds from getting boxed in. I need leverage and space—use the hostage to force a retreat toward cover and get Rosa/Tommy moving, while trying to needle Eddie’s loyalty against Crowe/Bureau.*

### Turn 205 [GAME]

You drag the hostage sideways, boots skidding on wet gravel, until the vent stack is at your flank. You keep his back square to Eddie’s rifle like a shield.

Eddie’s jaw works. He doesn’t lower the rifle, but his trigger finger eases—white-knuckled restraint. “Crowe don’t bury her own,” he calls back at you. “She makes examples.”

Your hostage makes a desperate, ugly move—he throws his head back, smashing the crown of his skull into your cheekbone. Stars pop at the edge of your vision. Your grip holds, but it loosens a fraction; his gun wrist twitches, trying to angle the muzzle up.

Rosa and Tommy keep crawling left, exactly like you ordered. Tommy disappears behind a low skylight curb; Rosa follows, paint can scraping tar.

The Vice man jerks back from the bulkhead as the fire belches again. The bulkhead frame is actively burning now; tar bubbles and spits. He coughs hard, eyes watering, and staggers onto the roof proper.

He spits out the answer you demanded, fast and panicked: “North side—there’s a service ladder down to the catwalk over the loading bay. And—” he points with a shaking hand past the vent stacks “—a roof hatch by the water tank. Leads to the upper landing—if it ain’t chained.”

Before you can press him, movement cuts across the roofline.

Crowe shows herself: a lean silhouette in a dark coat, hat brim shedding rain, coming in low behind a row of vents so Eddie’s rifle never has to swing far. She’s not rushing; she’s closing like she owns the distance. In her right hand, something small and pale flashes—wire or chain—held loose, ready.

She calls out, voice calm as a hymn: “Eve Marlowe. Let the boy breathe and I’ll let your friends keep their knees.”

Eddie’s rifle stays trained, but now it’s not just a threat—it’s a bracket, holding you in place while Crowe angles to cut you off from the ladder route.

Behind you, the bulkhead opening vomits thicker smoke; the doorway is no longer a viable retreat. In another few breaths, the heat will force anyone near it to the ground or off the roof.

Immediate threats are now clear:
- Crowe is within a few strides of striking distance, circling to block escape routes.
- Eddie maintains a firing line and is steady.
- Your hostage is still fighting and trying to bring his pistol up.
- Fire has effectively sealed the bulkhead.

### Turn 206 [PLAYER]

I wrench the pistol hard, twisting his wrist until it pops and the gun skitters away on the tar, then I shove him backward into Eddie’s line with a snarl. “Fetch.”

I don’t wait to see if it buys me mercy— I bolt low toward the water tank hatch, calling over my shoulder to Crowe, “You want me, Crowe? Keep up,” and I shout for Rosa and Tommy, “Hatch by the tank—MOVE!”

*Agent reasoning: Crowe’s closing to take me alive and Eddie’s got me bracketed; I need distance and cover more than leverage. The hostage is turning into a liability with that pistol, so I’ll disarm him and use him as a thrown problem to break Eddie’s aim, then run for the water-tank hatch before Crowe can get her wire on me.*

### Turn 207 [GAME]

You torque the hostage’s wrist down and out.

There’s a wet, sick pop—his scream comes a beat later. The pistol slips free of his fingers and skitters across the tar in a short, scraping arc, stopping near the base of a vent.

You shove him backward toward Eddie’s sightline. He stumbles, clutching his ruined wrist to his chest, eyes blown wide with pain.

“Fetch,” you snarl—and you go.

You drop low and bolt for the water-tank hatch, boots slipping once on rain-slick gravel before you catch yourself on a hand and keep moving.

Eddie’s rifle snaps a hair to follow you, but his own man lurching into the lane fouls the shot. Eddie barks, “Get down!” and doesn’t fire—yet.

Crowe moves immediately. Not chasing straight—cutting angle. She sprints in a shallow arc to beat you to the hatch line, coat tails snapping, that pale length of wire/chain swinging ready at her side.

Behind you, the injured man half-falls, half-crawls toward his gun with his good hand, teeth bared. Eddie shifts his weight like he’s about to step in and cover him.

Rosa and Tommy, hearing you, break from cover and scramble the direction you shouted—low, fast, panicked. Tommy’s limp makes him slower; Rosa grabs his sleeve and yanks him along.

You reach the hatch: a squat metal door set into the roof near the tank’s iron legs. There’s a chain on it—looped through the handle—and a cheap padlock, already rust-bitten.

Crowe is closing from your right, maybe ten yards and shrinking. Eddie’s rifle is recovering its lane as his man clears it.

The immediate threat is simple and brutal:
- The hatch is chained and locked; you can’t just drop through.
- Crowe will be on you in seconds.
- Eddie now has a clearer shot as you’re pinned at the hatch.

### Turn 208 [PLAYER]

I duck hard behind the water tank’s iron legs, putting metal between me and Eddie’s rifle, and rip off a loose chunk of tarred gravel/brick from the roof edge. “Rosa—Tommy—get on me, now!” I bark, then I slam the makeshift club down on the padlock and chain like I’m ringing a bell, over and over.  

Without looking up, I spit toward Crowe, “You always come with a leash, Crowe, or is that just for girls you can’t scare?” and if she gets within arm’s reach I whip a bootful of wet gravel at her face and lunge back into the lock again.

*Agent reasoning: I’m cornered at a locked hatch with a rifle on me and Crowe rushing—no time for finesse. I’ll use the tank legs as cover from Eddie and gamble on brute force: smash the lock/chain with whatever’s at hand, and if Crowe closes, I’ll kick gravel/strike dirty to buy a second.*

### Turn 209 [GAME]

You duck behind the water tank’s iron legs. The thick, riveted supports cut Eddie’s line clean; his rifle barrel tracks, but there’s no shot without stepping wide.

You wrench at the roof edge and get a fist-sized chunk of tarred brick and gravel. It’s ugly and heavy. You bring it down on the padlock.

First strike: a metallic *clang* that rings through the rain.
Second: the lock jumps, but holds.
Third: the chain bites into the hatch handle and sprays rust dust.

Rosa and Tommy scramble toward you. Tommy’s breathing is a ragged saw; Rosa is half-dragging him, shoes slipping. They’re still a few strides out.

Crowe closes to within a few yards, then slows—smart. She doesn’t rush into your swing. The pale thing in her hand is clearer now: a short length of fine chain with a weighted end, like a sap made for bones and breath. She keeps it low, ready to snap up.

“You talk pretty when you’re cornered,” she says, voice steady. “Doesn’t change the math.”

You spit the line about her leash without looking up and keep hammering.

The padlock finally gives—not cleanly. On the next blow, the shackle twists and cracks, and the lock body splits. The chain slumps loose across the hatch.

At the exact moment the lock breaks, Eddie steps wide left to re-find an angle around the tank legs. He gets a slice of you—shoulder and head—between iron uprights. He doesn’t take a careful shot. He fires once, quick.

The bullet whines off iron with a vicious *ping* and throws a hot fleck that stings your upper arm like a cigarette kiss. Not a through-and-through—more a grazing burn and torn fabric—but it jolts you.

Crowe uses the gunshot as cover. She surges in the last steps.

You scoop a bootful of wet gravel and whip it up. It splatters across her cheek and into one eye. She hisses and turns her face away, blinking hard—but she’s already committed. The weighted chain snaps out anyway, low and fast, aiming for your wrist/hand on the hatch.

Rosa reaches the tank legs just as the chain whistles past her shoulder. She yelps and ducks. Tommy drops to his knees, scrambling for the hatch handle with shaking hands.

The hatch is now unchained and can be opened—but Crowe is in striking distance, Eddie has a partial angle again, and the Saints man with the busted wrist is still somewhere behind you on the roof, not out of this yet.
