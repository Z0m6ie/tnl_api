      "content": "Morning in **Gullhook Row**, Brinewick’s dockside warren, arrives as a dim gray smear behind salt fog. Your office sits above a shuttered bait shop, the stairwell smelling of fish-oil and cheap violet incense. Outside, a Mourning Office checkpoint bell clinks on the corner, and the gaslamps still burn like they forgot it’s day.\n\nYou’re at your desk with yesterday’s case photos spread under a cracked magnifier. A thin line of chalk dust marks where you tested for residue sigils, and your coat is still damp at the cuffs from leaning over seawall stones. You’re scraping wax from a seal with a scalpel, careful not to tear the paper—old habit from an archivist’s backroom, where the truth was always folded small.\n\nThree soft taps land on your door. Not knuckles. A mourner’s code.\n\nWhen you open it, the hall is empty. On the floor sits a **Civic Mourning Office satchel**, salt-damp, tagged with your name in immaculate ink. The strap is tied with **dock-twine** you recognize from the Drownmarket piers. Inside: a grief permit stamped **UNREGISTERED**, still tacky as if rushed; a **Sableglass Theater** masque invitation that leaks perfume into your fingertips; and a shard of **black glass** wrapped in tar paper. You tilt the shard toward the window. The reflection is wrong—your desk is there, but the shadows don’t match. For a second they arrange into a lovers’ sigil you’ve only seen half-scraped off alley brick before the “Emergency Decency Audit” crews arrived.\n\nFrom the street below, a clerk’s voice carries through the fog: “Audit sweep moving east. Seal the next block. Confiscate papers.” The checkpoint bell clinks again, closer this time.\n\nThe satchel is contraband, the permit could get you through sealed streets, and the invitation is a timed lure. You’re standing in your doorway with evidence that shouldn’t exist and footsteps coming up the stairs.",

When you whisper the reveal-thread, the shard answers with a faint vibration that climbs your bones like a tuning fork. A hairline cut opens where the edge kisses skin—no gush, just a bead of blood that the glass seems eager to drink.\n\nIn the shard’s reflection, your office shadows detach from their corners and braid together into a sigil: two figures back-to-back, each holding the other’s throat with a ribbon. The ribbon knots into a lantern shape at the center—**a Lacquered Lantern binding mark**—but the outer ring is municipal: tidy little registry ticks like those on Mourning Office forms. It isn’t just romance. It’s *filed* romance.\n\nThe perfume from the invitation thickens as you focus on it—violet-amber ash, sweet enough to make your tongue feel slow. For half a second, the printed masquerade text seems to shift, as if it’s trying to replace your name with someone else’s.\n\nFootsteps reach your landing.\n\nYou slide shard and invitation into the hollowed ledger in your desk. The moment the ledger closes, the room feels fractionally warmer, like you’ve shut a window on the sea. You keep the grief permit in hand—its stamp reads **UNREGISTERED** in red, the ink still slightly raised.\n\nYou move to the door and call out, bored and crisp: “One moment—Mourning Office business.”\n\nOn the other side, a pause. Then a man’s voice, young, careful, trained to sound harmless.\n\n“Registrar’s assistant. **Tollin Wreave**. Audit support.” Paper rustles. “We’re verifying permits on this stair. I’ll need to see yours through the gap, Investigator Lorne.”\n\nSomething thin slides against the wood near the latch—metal, testing, not forcing. A second set of steps stops one flight below and stays there, silent.\n\nWreave adds, softer: “Chain stays on. Just… show the stamp. Quick as breath.”\n\nIf you open the door more than the chain allows, they’ll have a line of sight into your office. If you don’t show it, they can mark you noncompliant and call in the checkpoint bell.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"Civic Mourning Office satchel\",\"Grief permit (UNREGISTERED)\",\"Sableglass Masque invitation\",\"Black glass shard\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Gullhook Row - Vesper's office\"],\"npcs_add\":[\"Tollin Wreave (Civic Mourning Office registrar's assistant)\"]}\n```",

The thin metal you felt at the latch withdraws immediately—he tucks a little flat pick back behind his clipboard as if it was always just a pen.\n\n“Testing?” he repeats, smile tight. “No, sir. Old locks. Buildings swell in the fog.”\n\nAt your comment about the breathing, the silence below breaks: a small, deliberate cough from one landing down—polite, practiced, like a signal. A man you can’t fully see shifts position; you catch the corner of a grief-permit satchel and a pale hand on the rail. He doesn’t come up. He just *listens*.\n\nTollin clears his throat and, without asking, reaches two fingers toward the permit as if to “steady it for a look.” His nails are ink-stained, the kind you get handling registry books all day.\n\n“Let me just confirm the seal impression,” he says. “Audit protocol. Quick as breath.”\n\nBehind him, farther down the stairs, the checkpoint bell on the street gives a single clink—answered by a second clink, closer, like someone has stepped under it.\n\nTollin’s voice drops, still friendly: “If the stamp’s clean, this takes five seconds. If it isn’t… I have to log the address.”\n\nThe threat is plain: if he gets his fingers on the permit, he can tilt it into the light and catch the **UNREGISTERED**.

The sound is sharp in the cramped stairwell.\n\n“What’s my file number, Tollin? Say it out loud.”\n\nTollin looks down at his clipboard as if it’s going to rescue him.

There is no number to read, and you can see him decide, in real time, not to say that part.\n\n“And whose pick were you using on my latch?”\n\nThe “friend” below takes one step up—close enough that you can finally see him: broad-shouldered, coat too fine for this stairwell, Mourning satchel carried like a prop.

You get compliance.”\n\nThen he does something concrete: he reaches past Tollin and hooks a thin strip of paper—an official logging tag—onto your doorchain.

A pause—long enough to be deliberate—then a voice answers from the dark below the half-landing, smooth and almost bored:\n\n“Bailiff Kettle. Shadow Court mediation detail.”\n\nAs he speaks, the gaslamp on the landing gutter-flares—steady, then a sudden bright lick of light along the banister. In that flare you see it: a shadow shaped wrong, folded into the darkest wedge beneath the half-landing where banister meets wall. It’s not attached to any feet you can see.

Don’t make it theatrical, Lorne.”\n\nConcrete threat: the tag on your chain is now a sympathetic anchor at your threshold, and Kettle’s unnatural shadow is probing toward the doorcrack—staying just shy of the lamp-bright line, like it’s waiting for someone to shift, dim the light, or open wider.",

The remaining bristle twitches once, like a cut nerve, then lies still.\n\nThe logging tag itself loosens and slides half an inch down the chain, no longer “hugging” the link. You’ve damaged whatever sympathetic purchase it had, but you haven’t removed the tag entirely; part of the anchor is still present.\n\nFrom below, Kettle’s voice comes up the stairwell, amused in that professional way that never reaches kindness. “Petitioner prefers not to be named.”\n\nHis shadow advances two treads at once—too fast for the pace of his boots. It lengthens toward the doorcrack, thinning as it goes, like ink pulled under a knife. It stops just short of the bright strip cast by the landing lamp, pressing against the light-line as if it’s testing how firm reality is today.\n\nThe gloved man finally answers your “theatrical” remark by pulling a pen from inside his sleeve. Not a fountain pen—something with a blunt nib meant for carbon forms. He taps it against the notice. *Tap tap.* “Sign, and the tag comes off. Refuse, and we start logging what’s inside your office as ‘indecent materials.’”\n\nTollin’s eyes flick to your hand on the chain, then to the damaged bristle, and you see him decide to save himself.\n\nHe whispers, fast and ragged: “Cipher—” He hesitates as the gloved man’s gaze pins him. Tollin forces it out anyway, barely audible: “**L**.”\n\nThe gloved man’s jaw tightens. His free hand closes around Tollin’s clipboard hard enough the board creaks.\n\nKettle’s boots stop again. His shadow stays pressed to the edge of the lamp-light, poised—waiting for the smallest change: the door opening wider, the lamp guttering, or you stepping back from the threshold.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}",

You can’t fully strip it without either tearing the tag or opening the door wider. You do manage to pull the tag flush against the inside hardware, tucking it out of the crack’s line—reducing whatever line-of-sight the stairwell has on it.\n\nThe gloved man sees the movement anyway. His pen stops tapping.\n\nKettle answers your raised voice from below, tone flattening into official recitation. “Mediation matter: breach of civic decency by continued pursuit of sealed romantic-ritual deaths. Petitioner alleges harassment of protected mourners.”\n\nAs he says *protected mourners*, his shadow does something new: it spreads sideways along the edge of the lamp-light, like liquid trying to find a seam. It doesn’t cross the bright line—but it begins to *map* it, tracing the boundary as if learning where it will be weakest if the flame gutters.\n\nTollin’s face goes pale at “protected mourners.” That phrase has teeth in the Mourning Office; it means someone important is in the ledger.\n\nYou tell him to walk away.\n\nHe tries.\n\nTollin shifts his weight back, turning his shoulder—then the gloved man’s hand clamps the top of Tollin’s clipboard and yanks him forward half a step, using him like a hooked coat. Tollin makes a small, involuntary sound, and the papers on the board flutter.\n\n“Registrar’s assistant,” the gloved man says quietly, “you’re staying until this is logged.”\n\nThen, to you, still controlled: “For the record, refusal noted. Next step is service and entry with witness.”\n\nHe reaches into his coat and produces a thin brass token stamped with the Mourning Office’s crescent—an entry warrant marker. He doesn’t present it through the crack; he just lets you see it.\n\nDownstairs, Kettle finally comes into partial view: a shoulder, a gloved hand on the banister, and a strip of face in gaslight. He doesn’t climb into the brightest patch. He angles his chin toward your door.\n\nConcrete threat, now immediate: they are moving from “pressure” to “forced entry with a keywright and Bailiff witness.” Kettle’s shadow is actively testing the light boundary, and Tollin has been physically restrained—meaning they’re willing to escalate and create leverage if you don’t comply.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}",

His head tilts a fraction.\n\nYou speak, level: token through the crack.\n\nHe doesn’t comply. He steps closer, and you see the brass token again, but held back from the gap—displayed for intimidation, not inspection. “You don’t get to audit my marks,” he says. “You get to sign, or you get to be witnessed.”\n\nDownstairs, Bailiff Kettle answers your raised voice without moving into the brightest patch. “Careful with threats, Lorne.”\n\nThen he gives you what you asked for—crookedly, like a bone tossed to a dog. “Initials: **E. S.** That’s all you’re owed.”\n\nThe gloved man’s free hand tightens on Tollin’s clipboard. Tollin flinches, and you hear the board’s clip creak. The registrar’s assistant’s eyes flick to you—pleading, angry, trapped.\n\nKettle continues, voice carrying up the stairwell: “Unsigned notice becomes signed the moment you refuse under service. Keywright’s book won’t help you if the entry is lawful.”\n\nConcrete threat: they’re not negotiating. Kettle is prepared to call a keywright and force the chain, and the gloved man is actively using Tollin as leverage. Your unbinding partially weakened the latch, but the tension from the hallway side is preventing it from releasing fully—meaning if they apply force with tools, your chain will likely give faster than it would have before.  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"Torn logging tag (inside half)\"],\"inventory_remove\":[\"Logging tag (intact)\"],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}",

Then a man answers close to the wood, amused and careful. “You’ve got the wrong name, Lorne. Kettle doesn’t climb stairs.”\n\nPaper slides under the door—thick, official stock. Not a writ. A notice form, half-folded so you can see the header: **SHADOW COURT BAILIFF SERVICE — INTENT TO CLASSIFY: UNREGISTERED GRIEF**. No magistrate seal visible from this angle; just a blank line where one should be, and a red wax thumbprint that isn’t impressed with a signet—just pressed on, messy.\n\n“I’m here,” the voice continues, “to give you one last chance to make yourself tidy. You withdraw from the vanished-couples inquiry, you sign, you stay registered. You don’t—” a soft tap on the door, right where your chain used to be “—and the city’s allowed to treat you like a loose death.”\n\nWhile he talks, you crouch and scratch the salt-chalk sigil on the inside threshold. The chalk bites the varnish; the lines go down quick and ugly. The air around it goes faintly metallic, like you’ve just licked a coin.\n\nBack at the rear window, you watch the alley.\n\nThe first watcher’s boots are still by your discarded coat. The newcomer arrives into view: narrow shoes, polished toes, no municipal hobnails. Their hem is dark and tailored, the kind that doesn’t brush tenement filth unless it has to. When they step, a small glint swings at knee-height—an enamel token on a short chain, catching lamp-light: a lacquered lantern emblem, black on gold.\n\nThey stop beside the first watcher. You hear a low exchange, half-swallowed by fog.\n\n“Is it him?” the newcomer asks.\n\n“Up there. Window line,” the first replies.\n\nAt the front door, something scrapes—metal on metal—followed by the quiet click of a tool finding the lock. They’re not waiting for your answer anymore.

You slip to the rear, shoulder through the narrow window gap, and drop to the alley by the drainpipe. Your landing is light—boots kiss wet stone, no slip—though your palm scrapes on the pipe’s rust seam.\n\nIn the fog, the lacquer-token newcomer turns at the sound from upstairs. Their head tips, listening. They don’t run; they *signal*—two fingers lifted, a small circular motion.\n\nFrom the street mouth of the alley, a reply comes: the muted clop of approaching steps, multiple, measured.\n\nThe newcomer murmurs to the watcher you saw earlier, close enough for you to catch: “He’s out. Don’t grab—guide.”\n\nThey start walking, not away, but *along* the alley line that leads toward Gullhook Row’s main artery—hands visible at their sides, posture deliberately nonthreatening. The enamel token glints once, and when they pass a lamp, you see their other hand is ink-stained at the thumb and forefinger, as if they’ve been handling perfumed paper.\n\nBehind you, above, the front door bangs wider.

Her head turns slightly toward your drainpipe shadow. She doesn’t look right at you—she looks *past* you, as if checking the air.\n\nHer hand rises, fingers pinched, and she touches the enamel lantern token. It gives a tiny click, like a clasp.\n\n“Wind,” she says softly to the watcher. “He’s here.”\n\nThe watcher’s hand goes under his coat.\n\nYou don’t wait. You climb—boots finding the drainpipe brackets, hands biting rust. A bracket groans once under your weight; rust flakes into your sleeve. You swing onto a narrow overhang—an ugly little rain-lip above a boarded window. Your knee knocks wood; the board thuds, but holds.\n\nBelow, Mira steps back into the alley and lifts her voice toward the street-mouth, controlled and clear: “Rear line. Up. He’s above the second boarded pane.”\n\nSo much for missing the sweep.\n\nThe steps from the street arrive: four figures, not municipal. No hobnails. Soft-soled shoes and long coats that don’t flap. Two of them wear black gloves; one has a short truncheon tucked like a tool, not a weapon. On the lead one’s lapel, a pin catches the lamplight—black-and-gold lantern enamel, same motif as Mira’s token, but smaller, more discreet.\n\nThey don’t rush you. They spread to box the alley: two at the street mouth, one halfway in, Mira nearest your building line. The watcher you first saw keeps his hand under his coat and watches your perch.\n\nMira tilts her chin up. “Vesper. Don’t make us bleed in public. Come down and be *guided*.”\n\nYou are perched above them, exposed if they decide to climb or throw something. They have you located, and they’re coordinating rather than panicking.",

She plants her feet wider, like she’s bracing for a shove that won’t come.\n\n“Cute,” she calls back. “You think we’re Mourning?

A snare.\n\nThe cord lowers toward your perch, aiming to catch your wrist or hook around your ankle if you move wrong. The person holding it stays out of sight on the roofline, but their position is clear: they’re directly above your escape route back up.\n\nBelow, the halfway-in bailiff (the one without gloves) tests the wall with his palm—careful. His hand hits your chalked bracket and skates a fraction. He freezes, then pulls back and wipes his palm on his coat, eyes narrowing.\n\nMira’s voice flattens. “Vesper. Last clean offer.

The cord’s weighted end whips back down once, uncontrolled, and clips your forearm—more sting than impact—leaving a wet burn where the chalk dust has mixed with saltwater.\n\nBelow, Mira’s posture changes. She doesn’t look up anymore; she looks at the men around her and makes a two-finger sign—tight, impatient.\n\nThe gloved one with the lantern pin steps forward and produces something flat from inside his coat: a folded document board, wax-smeared at one corner.

Wood complains; the seam compresses to nearly nothing. When you press your palm flat over it through your sleeve, the airflow drops from a jet to a spiteful, intermittent hiss—like a kettle trying to breathe through a pinhole. The perfume still seeps, but slower, and it’s mostly trapped against your sleeve and the wall.\n\nConsequence: your sleeve is now **saturated**. The cloth clings to your skin, damp and cold, and the violet-amber stink is strong enough you taste it through your teeth even without inhaling.\n\nMira keeps her face turned away, speaking fast. “Lantern stink means *pairing medium.* It doesn’t just bind skin-to-skin—” She swallows, eyes flicking to Harrow and then to the lantern-pin man. “—it binds *story.* It makes you decide you’ve always wanted what it wants.”\n\nKnife-dog’s voice comes small now. “It gets in your head. Makes you—” he stops, jaw working, refusing to say the rest.\n\n“How do I choke a siphon without breathing it?” you ask.\n\nMira answers with what she can, not what you want. “You don’t *choke* it from this side. You cap the source or you drown it. Water cuts the perfume—saltwater best. But if it’s pressurized, it’ll keep pushing until the reservoir’s empty or the line breaks somewhere else.”\n\nAbove, Harrow shifts his stance; you feel the rope go from “held” to **anchored**—he’s braced it around something solid up there, taking the twitch out of it. “You’ve got slack,” he calls down, voice clipped. “You drop, you call it. I’m not catching surprises.”\n\nThe lantern-pin man takes out a small paper slip and a stub of pencil, shielding it from fog with his body. He starts writing anyway, eyes never leaving your wedged board. “This is municipal property,” he says, calm as a coffin. “You’re sealing evidence.”\n\nMira snaps back, “You’re *watching* evidence vent into a tenement.”\n\nThe immediate threat is now twofold and concrete:\n1) The siphon is still **actively pressurizing** against your seal; if the wedge shifts or your hand slips, it will vent a stronger burst directly into the stairwell air.\n2) Your sleeve and palm are contaminated; if you lower your guard and breathe normally, you risk inhaling enough pairing medium to start **memory-skips and compulsions**—and the lantern-pin clerk is already preparing to turn this into a charge.",

The gaslamp glow is still there, bruised and smeared by fog. What changes is sound: the stairwell’s usual drip and distant radio-prayer feel suddenly far away, as if someone shut a door between you and the building.\n\n“Mira—talk to me.”\n\nNo answer.\n\nYou turn your head as much as you can without breaking the seal. Mira is still on the stairs below—but she’s gone rigid, chin slightly lifted like she’s listening for a name in a crowd. Her hand, the one that held the lantern hook, has loosened. The hook hangs from two fingers, swaying.\n\n“Harrow—status on the line.”\n\nUp above: rope creaks against brick. Harrow’s silhouette shifts. “Line’s good,” he calls down immediately. “You didn’t black out. You’re still with me.” Then, sharper: “Don’t breathe deep. Your sleeve’s soaked.”\n\nKnife-dog isn’t running. He’s staring at Mira with an expression that’s half hunger, half panic—like he recognizes her as an answer to a question he never asked. He takes one involuntary step toward her.\n\nThe lantern-pin clerk has stopped writing. His pencil hovers. He’s looking at Mira too, and his mouth is slightly open, as if he’s about to speak a familiar pet name and can’t remember whose it belongs to.\n\nYou feel it in your own body—not a swoon, not a spell-circle snapping shut, but a **pull**: a thought trying to form around the idea that this moment has always been leading to a particular pairing. It’s not fully in you yet, but it’s at the edge, testing the seams.\n\nBehind your palm, the siphon gives a single stronger **puff**, like it found a new path. The board shifts a hair against your chalk wedge—still closed, but the pressure is actively working it.\n\nThreat, immediate and concrete: the medium is now affecting the people below you first. Mira is on the cusp of a compulsion state; knife-dog and the clerk are being drawn toward her.

His eyes keep trying to slide back to Mira anyway, but he forces them to the floorboards. “I’m— I’m sitting. I’m sitting,” he repeats, breath fast.\n\nThe clerk hesitates half a beat too long. Then whatever professional composure he had loses a tooth: he turns his back to Mira and the stairwell, shoulders hunched, and pulls his coat sleeve up over his mouth and nose. His pencil drops and clatters down two steps. “This is— this is highly irregular,” he muffles into wool, but he doesn’t turn back.\n\nHarrow answers with action, not words. The rope jerks—tightens—then starts moving with measured pulls. You hear brick grit as it runs over the parapet above.\n\n“Mira—name five things you can see.”\n\nMira blinks like she’s waking up underwater. Her lips part; no sound at first. Then, on the second try, she speaks—flat, forced, anchoring herself one object at a time.\n\n“Rail. Rust… on the rail.” Swallow. “Your… sleeve. Chalk. The— the clerk’s pin. Knife-dog’s boots.”\n\nThe rope goes taut again. Harrow has hooked it down—using the lantern hook as an ugly improvised lift point. Mira’s fingers clamp reflexively around the hook as it pulls. It bites into her grip; she gasps, pain punching through the haze. Good: pain is reality. Bad: her body is now moving toward you, up the stairwell, through air that’s still contaminated.\n\n“Nobody touches anybody,” Harrow calls down, voice strained with the haul. “I’ve got her. Keep your seal.”\n\nAs Mira rises, the siphon behind your palm gives another insistent **puff**. The board shudders against your wedge. Your chalk-sigil around the nail holes smears where your forearm brushes it—still there, but imperfect.\n\nConcrete threat: Mira is being lifted through the affected air toward the roofline. If the board shifts further, the next vent will hit her full in the face on the way up; if she coughs or panics, she’ll inhale deeper.

It lands between Mira and the wall in a heavy fold—an improvised curtain that blocks line-of-sight and catches some of the draft. It doesn’t stop the air itself, but it breaks the “seeing” part of whatever’s trying to form.\n\n“Mira—wrap your sleeve—”\n\nShe fumbles, then obeys. Sleeve over nose and mouth. Her breathing goes shallow, ragged but controlled.\n\n“Mother’s name,” you prompt.\n\n“E-Esme,” she says into cloth. “Esme Rook.”\n\n“Last meal.”\n\n“Pickled herring… and bread. Cold.” The answer comes quicker. Her eyes focus on your coat like it’s an instruction sheet.\n\nThe clerk, still facing away, pats his vest with one hand, then his coat. “I have water—work issue,” he says, voice pinched. He crouches, sets something metal on the step, and **rolls** it up the stairs without turning. It bumps twice, then comes to rest a step below Mira’s dangling boots: a dented, municipal canteen stamped with the Mourning Office seal. “No salt,” he adds. “Not on my person.”\n\nYou press your ear to the board.\n\nBehind it, the siphon isn’t a voice—it's infrastructure. You hear a **wet, periodic draw**, like a bellows pulling through a narrow throat, then the faintest slosh answering it. The reservoir isn’t right behind the board; it’s *lower*, feeding upward. Each draw is followed by that thin pressure tick you felt earlier.\n\nAs you listen, the board shifts another fraction against your wedge. Not open—yet—but the seam **breathes**. A cold, perfumed exhale threads out and hits your cheekbone where your seal isn’t perfect.\n\nImmediate consequence: your eyes sting and your throat tightens with the reflex to inhale deeper.\n\nMira, muffled, manages: “If it’s the… Lantern blend? It’s usually… bladdered. Pig bladder or gut-skin. Easy to hide under clothes, under seats. Piped is… municipal. Too loud. Too traceable.”\n\nHarrow swears under his breath. “Vesper—your wedge is walking.”\n\nThreat, clear and present: the feed is coming from below (a hidden bladder or line), and the seam is starting to leak around your ear/cheek. If the board gives any more, the next puff will vent directly into your face and down onto Mira’s position—she’ll take it full, and the clerk and knife-dog will catch the drift a heartbeat later.",

She nods once, small, and keeps her breaths shallow into her sleeve.\n\nYou snag the canteen with your boot and drag it up, metal scraping stone. With your free hand you work the cap. It resists—then gives with a sharp twist. Water slaps out in a sloppy sheet onto the seam and runs down into the nail holes, darkening the chalk-sigil to gray paste.\n\nFor a moment the board’s “breathing” changes: the **tick-tick** becomes a dampened **thup**, like the pressure has to push through wet fibers now. The seam swells slightly where the wood drinks.\n\nThen the downside hits. The perfumed medium catches in the wet and starts to **foam** at the edge—tiny pearled bubbles that cling instead of dissipating. The smell intensifies, sweeter and more intimate, because it’s no longer just air; it’s a film.\n\nBelow, the clerk stays faced away, rigid.

Hook I can lower.”\n\nA second later, something metal scrapes at the parapet. The lantern hook descends on the line, swinging slightly. It’s not a knife tip—more like a blunt, curved beak. Usable for prying or snagging, not for delicate probing.\n\nAs it comes down, the wet seam gives a sudden **spit**—a single bead of black-violet fluid pushes out from one nail hole and slides down your watered chalk, leaving an inky comet trail.\n\nThreat, immediate: your “gasket” is holding back open venting, but it’s concentrating the binding medium into a sticky film that can transfer by touch. If that hook (or your fingers) picks up the foamed residue and then contacts Mira, rope, or your own skin, you risk spreading the compulsion instead of containing it.

The foam on the steps stays scabbed and stalled; it does not cross the ash.\n\nThe porter backs away, palms up. “Varnish came from Latch & Lye on Mourners’ Cut—cheap stuff.

A teardrop of lacquer set like a punctuation mark. Someone put it there and wanted it overlooked.\n\nThe clerk jolts at your barked order and overfills the scoop, ash spilling onto his shoes. He dumps it onto the berm with shaking hands. “Flat—flat—” He looks around like the room might provide a miracle. No tile. No metal plate. The nearest “board” is his ledger’s stiff backing—but it’s wrapped in treated leather and pasteboard, and he hesitates at your “no wood” like it’s a gun to his head.\n\nHarrow makes the call instead. He yanks a thin, battered **tin serving tray** off a side table by the stairs—tarnished, dented, but metal. He slides it toward the thin patch with his boot, stopping short of the ash line. “That work?”\n\nYou nudge the warm tinder-tin farther along the stone.\n\nThe mist responds like a dog to a whistle: it peels away from the weak spot and follows the heat, pooling and pressing against the ash line where the tin now sits. The pressure at the thinned patch eases—briefly. But the mist is thicker now, and its testing is more coordinated: repeated pushes in the same place, like it’s learning.\n\nAt the post base, the shard-finger keeps clicking, still drawn toward the tin.

The nail scrapes once under the tourniquet.\n\n“The porter.”\n\nHarrow freezes so hard you can hear his breath stop. His hand goes up, reflexively, to the side of his neck—behind the ear. When his fingers touch skin there, he flinches like he found a burn. “I— I don’t—” he starts, then swallows. His eyes dart to the lacquer drip above the latch as if it’s accusing him personally.\n\nThe clerk, still crouched at the berm, stares at Harrow with a new kind of fear and edges his knees backward, away from him, without standing.\n\nThreats made plain:\n- The lacquer drip confirms this door is Lantern-marked.\n- The mist is now massing at the ash line near your heat lure; if the line fails anywhere, it will pour in fast.\n- Harrow is identified as marked; his panic could spike “warmth” and draw the mist’s attention if he bolts or breaks the boundary.",

His eyes are wide but fixed on yours—anchored by the fact that you’re treating him like a problem with steps, not a man being judged.\n\nYou angle his head. Keeping your sleeve between you and his skin, you peer behind his ear.\n\nThere’s a spot the size of a thumbnail that looks normal until you stop blinking: the skin there has a faint, varnish-like sheen, as if it’s been lacquered from the inside. No visible ink. No raised scar. But the air above it feels subtly wrong—like standing near a kettle you can’t see. When Harrow exhales, the sheen brightens a fraction, then dulls.\n\nAt your command, the clerk doesn’t argue. He hooks the tin serving tray with the edge of his metal scoop and slides it forward, flat, over the thin blackening patch like a lid. The tray kisses ash with a soft scrape. He then heaps ash along the tray’s edges, packing it down with the scoop’s back until the metal is choked in gray. The thinned patch is no longer exposed.\n\nImmediate effect: the mist’s probing at that weak spot stops. It shifts its pressure toward the nearest unreinforced arc of the ash line—closer to where your warm tinder-tin now sits—and begins pushing there instead, the fog thickening into a denser, more muscular smear against the boundary.\n\nYou lean into the puncture.\n\nThe voice answers, precise and unpleasantly satisfied:\n\n“**Beacon** first. It tells the Society where the warmth is.”\n\n“**Leash** second. It tugs when the invitation is near. When the music starts.”\n\nA pause—something scrapes under your cloth tourniquet, testing.\n\n“**Key** last. It opens *him*. Not doors.”\n\nWhen you ask how to make him cold enough, the puncture exhales brine again, and the reply comes like a recipe:\n\n“Take the warmth away. **Saltwater on the mark.** Cold iron close. Keep his mouth shut. Keep his pulse slow.”\n\nAs it speaks, Harrow’s lacquer-sheen flares—just once—like the mark heard its own description. The mist outside responds: a thicker tongue of it peels off the pooled mass and slides along the step toward Harrow’s side of the doorway, stopping at the ash line as if scenting him specifically.\n\nHarrow whispers, barely moving his lips, “I didn’t ask for it.”\n\nThe threat is now directional: the mist isn’t just testing the barrier randomly; it’s orienting toward Harrow’s marked heat, and it’s concentrating pressure near the lure you control. If the ash line breaks there, it will surge straight toward him.",

Not touching—still, the air around the key goes thin and cold. The lacquer-spot answers with a faint, insectile clicking you feel more than hear. Harrow’s jaw locks; he takes the “small breaths” you ordered, shallow and obedient, eyes wide on a point past your shoulder.\n\nThe clerk—sleeves rolled, face gray with the kind of fear that tries to become professionalism—does what you said.

Seats filled at a theater that isn’t only a theater.”\n\nHis eyes flick to your iron key like it burns.\n\n“Celyne gets… a clean page,” the borrowed voice adds, suddenly strained. “A pardon from the Audit.

The blackening that was tracing the lip hits your wet seal and stops dead—no hesitation, no probing. It *can’t* cross. It bunches up behind the brine line like soot caught in a gutter.\n\nYou dust ash over the wet. The ash drinks the brine and sets into a gritty, gray crust. The tray’s edge looks stitched shut.\n\nBut the mist doesn’t surrender—its pressure changes. The boundary line pulls inward a fraction, as if whatever’s on the far side has decided to stop testing the “door” and start leaning on the “wall.” The air inside your circle grows colder; Harrow’s breath fogs.\n\nForehead to forehead, you press the questions.\n\nThe lacquer-spot behind Harrow’s ear vibrates against your brined glove.

Tollin Wreave carries the keys when the senior hands are ‘praying.’”\n\nAt the name, the clerk’s eyes flick—just once—to the satchel on the floor like he knows exactly whose handwriting is on the tag.\n\nHarrow’s own voice breaks through in a hoarse rush, as if he’s trying to get it out before the other thing clamps down again.\n\n“Under the Lantern—door’s not wood. It’s… glass painted black from the inside.

It opens for the paired.”\n\nAs it speaks, the ash-crescent near the blackening darkens—not spreading, but deepening, as if soaking up light. The clerk suddenly inhales sharp.\n\n“Cold,” he says, teeth chattering. “On my ankle.”\n\nHe still hasn’t moved—yet.

It’s **testing**: pressing in one point, releasing, pressing again a few inches away—like a thumb checking for soft wood.\n\nNow, the specific checks you asked for:\n\n1) **Tin tray seam:** The ash crust at the lip has **split into a hairline crack** right where you’d sealed it earlier, no wider than a thread. From that crack, a damp shine beads—*not water*. It’s slightly oily, and it smells faintly of violet-amber perfume when you lean close.\n\n2) **Ash-crescent near Harrow:** The crescent has **spread by about a finger’s width** along the floor toward the clerk’s stance, but it hasn’t crossed your lines. The new growth is darker and finer-grained, like it burned hotter.\n\n3) **Clerk’s ankle cold:** The clerk—Tollin—keeps counting, voice thin: “...twelve… eleven…” He swallows hard. “Cold’s still at the foot. Numbness is **to the ball of the foot now**. Not up the ankle. It’s like it’s trying to make me *move*.”\n\n4) **Harrow’s lacquer-spot:** The spot has **raised** slightly, like a welt under the skin. The ticking-code continues. Harrow’s eyes are open now, unfocused, and he whispers without looking at you: “Vesper… it’s listening to the permit.”\n\nAs he says that, the **UNREGISTERED** stamp in your satchel gives a soft, papery *creak*—the sound of ink flexing—though nothing touches it.",

Tollin makes a broken sound in his throat but keeps counting. “Sixteen… seventeen…”\n\nYou lean to Harrow’s ear.

Your mouth still moves. You feel your throat work. But the sound is **cut**.\n\nWhat got “redacted” isn’t a sentence—it’s a **channel**. Something just took hold of the *act of saying* anything that names what’s happening.\n\nYour palms are still braced on the iron key. You can feel it: the key is cold enough to sting bone, and the brine under it is still reacting—bubbling in tiny, frantic pops you can now only sense through vibration.

The push trying to roll his foot eases the moment your brine “heel-cup” seals around the shoe. The saltwater hisses where it touches the frost on his boot, and the chalky white retreats a finger’s width up the leather.

He lifts his brine-wet finger again and draws.\n\nFirst: a mark that looks like an **official stamp** gone wrong—an oblong seal with a neat border, but the center is a **couple’s sigil** rendered in bureaucratic geometry: two interlocked hooks facing inward, joined by a thin line that ends in a tiny square checkbox. Around it he adds three short ticks like tally marks.\n\nAs the last tick goes down, the tray reacts: the oily line that had flattened against your reinforced weak point **rears** into a thin standing ridge, as if it’s trying to become a needle. It probes the salt at the exact whitened spot under the iron key-clamp, searching for a gap.\n\nSecond: he writes, slower, shaking harder:\n\n**STOP “THROUGH YOU” = NO NAME / NO PERMIT / NO THRESHOLD**\n**CUT THE RETURN PATH**\n**DON’T LET IT LOG YOU**\n\nWhen he finishes “LOG YOU,” Tollin’s pocket—where his registrar’s badge chain hangs—**jerks** once, metal tugged by an invisible hand.

The shard being muffled helped, but the Audit-mark being drawn gave it something to lock onto; the oily ridge is actively probing the one stressed point in your brine line, and Tollin’s registrar ID just got “noticed.”  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}",

Then the whole stack recoils as if yanked back by a cord.\n\nYou sweep your brine crescent through the collapsing “mouth,” dragging the severed edge into the catch-basin. The brine there boils in tiny, soundless pinpricks. The ink breaks up into beadlets that skitter around the crescent’s curve, refusing to settle—like living punctuation. A few beads try to climb back toward the crooked doorframe and fail, leaving thin gray smears like erased pencil.\n\nImmediate consequence: the decoy threshold is neutralized. Whatever was pushing through it has been forced back.\n\nNot free: the hall answers.\n\nFrom the real doorway comes a sharp, administrative *thunk*—a stamp landing on wood. Then another, lighter *thunk*, as if correcting alignment. The shadows under the door *bite* into the floorboards in three short bars, matching your thumb-stamp pattern. A thin line of dampness creeps in from under the door, not brine—ink-water, smelling faintly of violet-amber ash.\n\nTollin jerks at the sound but your two-finger jab holds him in place. He makes a small choking noise and clamps it down, eyes wide, still staring at the crack under the real door.\n\nHarrow doesn’t answer your look with words.

The ink-water line under the door thickens, searching for the brine cut you made earlier, trying to find purchase.\n\nThreat, clear: the hall-stamper is establishing a logged claim on this room through the real door; if it completes the “registration,” it won’t need the handle to come in.

The cloth immediately stiffens along the smear, fibers tightening as if starched; the violet-amber ash scent comes up sharp enough to sting the back of your throat.\n\nAt the real door, the ink line hesitates—thins where you stole from it—then surges to replace itself, now pushing in two narrow “tongues” instead of one.\n\nYou keep your palm on the iron key until the last instant, then drop low and slide toward the service gap.\n\nThe moment your pressure leaves the key, the floorboard gives a tiny, exhausted *creak*.

Tollin stumbles, catches himself, and follows—silent, eyes fixed forward like you ordered. When you hook two fingers into his sleeve to steer, you feel his arm shaking hard enough to telegraph through the fabric.\n\nAs you gesture your warning—no looking, no speaking—the real door handle does **not** turn.\n\nInstead, a thin rectangular shadow—perfectly straight-edged—slides under the door like a sheet of paper being fed through a slot.

As Tollin squeezes through, the satchel on your shoulder gives a sharp hum—your shard responding to the salt-air on the other side.\n\nBehind you, the paper-shadow pauses, then angles—like it has “noticed” the gap.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"Cloth scrap with ink-water smear\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

Below is an alley throat—cobbles slick, fish-oil sheen, a drain that breathes fog. To your left: a short iron stair down to the alley. To your right: the catwalk continues past shuttered windows toward a soot-stained ladder that climbs to the roofline. The sea is close enough you can hear stone being slapped.\n\nYou drag your brine-wet fingers across the metal lip of the gap. The salt leaves a smeared, gritty line. When you tug your coat hem over it, the fabric snags and you feel a brief tug—like a static pull—then it lets go. The “clean edge” is fouled, at least for the moment.\n\nInside, through the gap, something makes a dry sliding sound—paper searching for a slot. It doesn’t come through immediately, but you can hear it testing the opening from the other side.\n\nHarrow answers your whisper with a quick, practical murmur: “Catwalk. Down to the alley in ten steps. Up to roof if we need clean air.” He keeps his body between the gap and Tollin, one hand already on the stair rail.\n\nYou catch Tollin’s sleeve and turn his hands palm-up. His fingers are ink-stained from panic-sweat and old forms, but there’s no fresh three-bar log on his skin. Not on the knuckles, not in the creases. What you do find: a faint rectangular pressure mark on his wrist, like he recently wore a tight band—too straight-edged to be a watch.\n\nWhen you hold up the stiffened cloth scrap to the salt-air, it reacts fast. The smeared ink-water doesn’t dry; it *webs*. Fine lines crawl outward from the smear in right angles, sketching a partial grid across the fibers—ledger rulings. As the fog hits it, the violet-amber ash scent blooms, and the grid briefly resolves into three short bars near the center—then blurs again, as if the air is trying to “read” it and can’t keep focus.\n\nThreat becomes concrete: from inside the gap, a thin, straight-edged shadow presses toward the opening. Your salt-swipe makes it hesitate, but it starts to probe along the edges, looking for a clean, unbroken line to slip through. Harrow’s eyes flick to your cloth scrap, then back to the gap. “That thing’s keyed to records,” he says. “And it’s learning.” \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Back service catwalk (exterior)\"],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

The shadow there isn’t just darker—it’s broken up by old nail holes and hanging twine, making you harder to read at a glance.\n\nThe crooked salt loop goes onto the brick fast. When you flick the damp pebble through it, it doesn’t arc true—something about the loop “catches” the sound more than the stone. The pebble hits a puddle nearer the alley mouth with a convincing *splash-step*, followed by a second, lighter *skid* as it bounces.\n\nBoth men at the mouth react immediately.\n\nUmbrella tilts. One steps in—careful, toe-first—testing the alley like it might bite. The other stays at the threshold, head angled as if listening for a name, a breath, a confession. They’re not dockhands. Their shoes are too clean for this muck, even under the fog.\n\nThe one who entered crouches by the puddle, fingers hovering over the water without touching it, then straightens. He murmurs something you can’t catch. The other answers with a short, clipped sound—impatient.\n\nTollin whispers back to you, eyes fixed on their silhouettes. “The Ladder And Down—Registrar Seln mostly. Old crow, ink-stained cuffs. And… bailiff detail sometimes. They use it as a pass-through when they don’t want the front desk to see.” He swallows. “Third-step pry? Seln would notice. He counts things when he’s nervous.”\n\nYou angle the vial toward the watchers.\n\nThe clicking inside accelerates instantly—sharp, eager *tap-tap-tap-tap*—and you feel a faint pull in your palm, like a compass needle trying to swing your wrist.

No trouble if you’re properly logged.”\n\nThe man inside the alley takes one more step forward and stops, as if he’s reached an invisible edge. He doesn’t cross it—he scans the brickwork near you instead, eyes lingering on your fresh salt loop like he can see the disturbance it made.\n\nThey’re closing the net by patience, not speed.

He moves like he’s done this before: slow enough to be part of the trash, quick enough to not be counted.\n\nTollin leans in close, voice almost not there. “Seln’s tell—he wets his thumb even when he isn’t turning a page. Like he’s testing ink that isn’t on his skin.” He swallows hard. “And he answers to Lower Registry—Room 3B’s chain. Officially, the Senior Registrar. Unofficially…” His eyes flick toward the mouth. “He gets visits from men with umbrellas who don’t sign in.”\n\nYou scrape your boot through grit and fish-oil sheen, gather a smear of blackish muck, and drag it across the salt loop.

He doesn’t speak until he’s close enough to breathe in your ear.\n\n“Dirty exit,” he whispers. “Fishmonger’s cellar flap. Two paces behind you, right side—under the rotten scale table. It’s nailed, but the nails are old.”\n\nAs he says it, you hear it too: a faint, rhythmic *drip… drip…* not gutter-water—something from a low space under boards.\n\nThe man in the alley advances another step, and you see now what makes him wrong for a dockhand: his gloves are dry. Not a shine of wet on them, despite the fog.\n\nHe calls softly, closer than before. “Last chance to be civil.

      "Salt-fog thickens as the **Civic Mourning Office** begins an “Emergency Decency Audit,” sealing docks and tenements to re-log recent deaths—quietly scraping sigils from walls before anyone can sketch them. Simultaneously, the **Lacquered Lantern Society** announces a midnight charity masque at the Sableglass Theater, where invitations arrive already perfumed with binding ink; three prominent couples have vanished after receiving theirs.

      "Vesper Lorne wakes to a knock that doesn’t use knuckles—three soft taps, like a mourner’s code. On the floor outside their door sits a Civic Mourning Office satchel, salt-damp and reeked in violet-amber ash, tagged with Vesper’s name in an immaculate hand. Inside: a grief permit stamped **UNREGISTERED**, a theater invitation to the Sableglass Masque already bleeding perfume into the paper, and a shard of black glass wrapped in dock-twine. The glass reflects wrong; when Vesper tilts it, the room’s shadows rearrange into a lovers’ sigil they’ve only ever seen half-scraped off alley bricks during the new “Emergency Decency Audit.”\n\nBy noon, Mourning clerks have sealed Vesper’s last two case sites, citing “public decency,” and a junior registrar quietly offers to “return” confiscated evidence—for a favor, later, unspecified. By dusk, three of Vesper’s informants are missing, their rumor ledgers reduced to greasy ash piles stamped with the Shadow Court’s wax.\n\nThen the rival enforcer finds Vesper first. Not with a blade—worse, with paperwork: a notice of impending classification as *unregistered grief* unless Vesper signs a statement withdrawing from the vanished-couples inquiry. The enforcer’s gaze lingers on the Sableglass invitation as if they recognize the binding ink’s scent.\n\nSomebody inside the machine just handed Vesper contraband proof and a timed lure. The shard hums near saltwater. The invitation’s perfume grows stronger when Vesper lies. And the grief permit—if it’s real—grants access through checkpoints… straight into the Audit’s sealed streets."

The strap is tied with **dock-twine** you recognize from the Drownmarket piers. Inside: a grief permit stamped **UNREGISTERED**, still tacky as if rushed; a **Sableglass Theater** masque invitation that leaks perfume into your fingertips; and a shard of **black glass** wrapped in tar paper. You tilt the shard toward the window. The reflection is wrong—your desk is there, but the shadows don’t match. For a second they arrange into a lovers’ sigil you’ve only seen half-scraped off alley brick before the “Emergency Decency Audit” crews arrived.\n\nFrom the street below, a clerk’s voice carries through the fog: “Audit sweep moving east. Seal the next block. Confiscate papers.” The checkpoint bell clinks again, closer this time.\n\nThe satchel is contraband, the permit could get you through sealed streets, and the invitation is a timed lure. You’re standing in your doorway with evidence that shouldn’t exist and footsteps coming up the stairs."

      "Salt-fog politics in Brinewick hinge on three powers. The **Civic Mourning Office** publicly “protects decency” by cataloging deaths and issuing grief permits; privately it launders curse-evidence into a citywide romance ledger, matching victims to future sacrifices. The **Lacquered Lantern Society** hosts charity galas and patronizes the arts; beneath the perfume, it breeds fashionable love-spells to bind heirs, judges, and dock bosses into obedient couples. In the alleys, the **Shadow Court Bailiffs** pose as private security mediators; covertly they enforce the Court’s embargo on truth, disappearing investigators and buying silence with favors. The Mourning Office feeds the Lantern names, the Lantern funds the Bailiffs, and the Bailiffs strangle anyone—like Vesper—who notices the machine.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"factions\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Civic Mourning Office\",\n      \"public_front\": \"Municipal bureau that registers deaths, oversees funerary rites, and issues permits to prevent fraud and panic.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Collects occult forensics from scenes and compiles a romance-linked sacrifice ledger to steer future ritualized deaths.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Lacquered Lantern Society\",\n      \"public_front\": \"Elite philanthropic salon funding theaters, orphanages, and coastal relief through lavish galas.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Engineers love-spells and curated pairings to bind influential citizens into controllable, curse-chained relationships.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Shadow Court Bailiffs\",\n      \"public_front\": \"Discreet fixers and security mediators hired to settle disputes and protect patrons.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Enforces the Shadow Court’s secrecy by suppressing investigations, erasing witnesses, and maintaining an embargo on forbidden truths.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

      "Salt-fog thickens as the **Civic Mourning Office** begins an “Emergency Decency Audit,” sealing docks and tenements to re-log recent deaths—quietly scraping sigils from walls before anyone can sketch them. Simultaneously, the **Lacquered Lantern Society** announces a midnight charity masque at the Sableglass Theater, where invitations arrive already perfumed with binding ink; three prominent couples have vanished after receiving theirs.

      "Vesper Lorne wakes to a knock that doesn’t use knuckles—three soft taps, like a mourner’s code. On the floor outside their door sits a Civic Mourning Office satchel, salt-damp and reeked in violet-amber ash, tagged with Vesper’s name in an immaculate hand. Inside: a grief permit stamped **UNREGISTERED**, a theater invitation to the Sableglass Masque already bleeding perfume into the paper, and a shard of black glass wrapped in dock-twine. The glass reflects wrong; when Vesper tilts it, the room’s shadows rearrange into a lovers’ sigil they’ve only ever seen half-scraped off alley bricks during the new “Emergency Decency Audit.”\n\nBy noon, Mourning clerks have sealed Vesper’s last two case sites, citing “public decency,” and a junior registrar quietly offers to “return” confiscated evidence—for a favor, later, unspecified. By dusk, three of Vesper’s informants are missing, their rumor ledgers reduced to greasy ash piles stamped with the Shadow Court’s wax.\n\nThen the rival enforcer finds Vesper first. Not with a blade—worse, with paperwork: a notice of impending classification as *unregistered grief* unless Vesper signs a statement withdrawing from the vanished-couples inquiry. The enforcer’s gaze lingers on the Sableglass invitation as if they recognize the binding ink’s scent.\n\nSomebody inside the machine just handed Vesper contraband proof and a timed lure. The shard hums near saltwater. The invitation’s perfume grows stronger when Vesper lies. And the grief permit—if it’s real—grants access through checkpoints… straight into the Audit’s sealed streets."

Your office sits above a shuttered bait shop, the stairwell smelling of fish-oil and cheap violet incense. Outside, a Mourning Office checkpoint bell clinks on the corner, and the gaslamps still burn like they forgot it’s day.\n\nYou’re at your desk with yesterday’s case photos spread under a cracked magnifier. A thin line of chalk dust marks where you tested for residue sigils, and your coat is still damp at the cuffs from leaning over seawall stones. You’re scraping wax from a seal with a scalpel, careful not to tear the paper—old habit from an archivist’s backroom, where the truth was always folded small.\n\nThree soft taps land on your door. Not knuckles. A mourner’s code.\n\nWhen you open it, the hall is empty. On the floor sits a **Civic Mourning Office satchel**, salt-damp, tagged with your name in immaculate ink. The strap is tied with **dock-twine** you recognize from the Drownmarket piers. Inside: a grief permit stamped **UNREGISTERED**, still tacky as if rushed; a **Sableglass Theater** masque invitation that leaks perfume into your fingertips; and a shard of **black glass** wrapped in tar paper. You tilt the shard toward the window. The reflection is wrong—your desk is there, but the shadows don’t match. For a second they arrange into a lovers’ sigil you’ve only seen half-scraped off alley brick before the “Emergency Decency Audit” crews arrived.\n\nFrom the street below, a clerk’s voice carries through the fog: “Audit sweep moving east. Seal the next block. Confiscate papers.” The checkpoint bell clinks again, closer this time.\n\nThe satchel is contraband, the permit could get you through sealed streets, and the invitation is a timed lure. You’re standing in your doorway with evidence that shouldn’t exist and footsteps coming up the stairs."

The chain slides home with a metallic cough.\n\nYou press the black glass shard to your palm. It’s colder than seawater in winter. When you whisper the reveal-thread, the shard answers with a faint vibration that climbs your bones like a tuning fork. A hairline cut opens where the edge kisses skin—no gush, just a bead of blood that the glass seems eager to drink.\n\nIn the shard’s reflection, your office shadows detach from their corners and braid together into a sigil: two figures back-to-back, each holding the other’s throat with a ribbon. The ribbon knots into a lantern shape at the center—**a Lacquered Lantern binding mark**—but the outer ring is municipal: tidy little registry ticks like those on Mourning Office forms. It isn’t just romance. It’s *filed* romance.\n\nThe perfume from the invitation thickens as you focus on it—violet-amber ash, sweet enough to make your tongue feel slow. For half a second, the printed masquerade text seems to shift, as if it’s trying to replace your name with someone else’s.\n\nFootsteps reach your landing.\n\nYou slide shard and invitation into the hollowed ledger in your desk. The moment the ledger closes, the room feels fractionally warmer, like you’ve shut a window on the sea. You keep the grief permit in hand—its stamp reads **UNREGISTERED** in red, the ink still slightly raised.\n\nYou move to the door and call out, bored and crisp: “One moment—Mourning Office business.”\n\nOn the other side, a pause. Then a man’s voice, young, careful, trained to sound harmless.\n\n“Registrar’s assistant. **Tollin Wreave**. Audit support.” Paper rustles. “We’re verifying permits on this stair. I’ll need to see yours through the gap, Investigator Lorne.”\n\nSomething thin slides against the wood near the latch—metal, testing, not forcing. A second set of steps stops one flight below and stays there, silent.\n\nWreave adds, softer: “Chain stays on. Just… show the stamp. Quick as breath.”\n\nIf you open the door more than the chain allows, they’ll have a line of sight into your office. If you don’t show it, they can mark you noncompliant and call in the checkpoint bell.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"Civic Mourning Office satchel\",\"Grief permit (UNREGISTERED)\",\"Sableglass Masque invitation\",\"Black glass shard\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Gullhook Row - Vesper's office\"],\"npcs_add\":[\"Tollin Wreave (Civic Mourning Office registrar's assistant)\"]}\n```"

The thin metal you felt at the latch withdraws immediately—he tucks a little flat pick back behind his clipboard as if it was always just a pen.\n\n“Testing?” he repeats, smile tight. “No, sir. Old locks. Buildings swell in the fog.”\n\nAt your comment about the breathing, the silence below breaks: a small, deliberate cough from one landing down—polite, practiced, like a signal. A man you can’t fully see shifts position; you catch the corner of a grief-permit satchel and a pale hand on the rail. He doesn’t come up. He just *listens*.\n\nTollin clears his throat and, without asking, reaches two fingers toward the permit as if to “steady it for a look.” His nails are ink-stained, the kind you get handling registry books all day.\n\n“Let me just confirm the seal impression,” he says. “Audit protocol. Quick as breath.”\n\nBehind him, farther down the stairs, the checkpoint bell on the street gives a single clink—answered by a second clink, closer, like someone has stepped under it.\n\nTollin’s voice drops, still friendly: “If the stamp’s clean, this takes five seconds. If it isn’t… I have to log the address.”\n\nThe threat is plain: if he gets his fingers on the permit, he can tilt it into the light and catch the **UNREGISTERED**. If you deny him, he can mark you for a compliance visit—possibly with more than two people next time."

The sound is sharp in the cramped stairwell.\n\n“What’s my file number, Tollin? Say it out loud.”\n\nTollin looks down at his clipboard as if it’s going to rescue him. He wets his lips. “Lorne, Vesper. Freelance investigator. Prior liaison—” He stops. There is no number to read, and you can see him decide, in real time, not to say that part.\n\n“And whose pick were you using on my latch?”\n\nThe “friend” below takes one step up—close enough that you can finally see him: broad-shouldered, coat too fine for this stairwell, Mourning satchel carried like a prop. Not a clerk. His eyes are flat and amused, and he’s wearing black gloves despite the indoor warmth.\n\nHe speaks, calm as a receipt: “Protocol’s flexible during an Emergency Decency Audit.”\n\nTollin’s throat bobs. He shifts his body half an inch to block your view into the stairwell as if *he’s* the door now. “Investigator, please. Don’t make this difficult. We can log you compliant and be gone.”\n\nThe gloved man’s hand drops to the satchel at his hip. Not reaching for a weapon—reaching for papers.\n\n“A notice,” he says. “Impending classification. Unregistered grief.” He lets the words hang where your permit can hear them.\n\nThreat, clear and immediate: if they log you *noncompliant* or *unregistered*, Mourning Office authority can legally seal your office and seize “indecent” materials—today, not later.

Read me the routing mark, and I’ll hold still while you ‘log’ me.”\n\nThen I lean closer to the crack, voice low. “And if you’re here for something other than a permit check, say it plainly—because my office is warded for forced entry, and I’d hate for you to bleed on municipal stationery.”"

He glances down the stairs the way clerks glance at supervisors.\n\nThe gloved man steps up into full view, one hand still on the rail, the other producing a folded document with a Mourning Office seal—real wax, fresh press. He holds it up so you can see the header through the crack:\n\n**NOTICE OF IMPENDING CLASSIFICATION — UNREGISTERED GRIEF**\n\nNo signature line is visible from your angle, just the seal and a block of dense, weaponized language.\n\n“Name,” you say. “Division.”\n\nHe gives you a small, tired look. “You don’t get my name. You get compliance.”\n\nThen he does something concrete: he reaches past Tollin and hooks a thin strip of paper—an official logging tag—onto your doorchain. The tag is threaded with a black fiber that looks like hair. It doesn’t *bite* the chain, but it clings like it wants to.\n\nTollin, voice tight, reads from his clipboard anyway, trying to salvage the fiction. “Routing mark is… D-9, salt docket, Audit annex.”\n\nIt’s too fast, too smooth—memorized. And wrong in a way that’s hard to prove without the ledger.\n\nYour permit’s stamp-edge catches light again. Tollin’s pupils tighten. He sees enough.\n\nThe gloved man continues, measured: “We’re here for a withdrawal statement. You sign that you’re stepping away from the vanished-couples inquiry. In exchange, we log you compliant and the Audit doesn’t seal your office tonight.”\n\nHe taps the notice with one gloved finger. *Tap.* “You don’t sign, we file you as unregistered grief. That authorizes a decency seizure. Wards or not, they’ll bring a Mourning keywright and a Bailiff to witness.”\n\nDownstairs, the checkpoint bell clinks again—closer now—and you hear a third set of footsteps enter the stairwell, heavier, unhurried.\n\nThe threat is immediate and specific: they’re escalating from “permit check” to “serve notice + force withdrawal,” and reinforcements are arriving to make refusal expensive."

I’m being served an unsigned notice by an unnamed division.”  \n\nI keep the door on the chain and add, quieter to Tollin, “You’re in over your head.

It’s been lacquered with something that dulls the shine of the chain where it touches, leaving a faint matte crescent on the link.\n\nTollin flinches when you say “sympathetic hair.” His eyes dart to the gloved man, then to the stairs, as if checking whether he’s allowed to react.\n\nYour voice carries down the stairwell.\n\nThe heavier boots stop. A pause—long enough to be deliberate—then a voice answers from the dark below the half-landing, smooth and almost bored:\n\n“Bailiff Kettle. Shadow Court mediation detail.”\n\nAs he speaks, the gaslamp on the landing gutter-flares—steady, then a sudden bright lick of light along the banister. In that flare you see it: a shadow shaped wrong, folded into the darkest wedge beneath the half-landing where banister meets wall. It’s not attached to any feet you can see. It lies on the steps like a patient blade, angled toward your threshold.\n\nWhen the flame steadies, the shadow is still there—thicker than it should be, as if it’s soaking up light.\n\nThe gloved man doesn’t look back. He only tilts his head a fraction, satisfied Kettle announced himself.\n\nTollin swallows hard at your quiet warning. His hand tightens on the clipboard until the paper creases. He whispers, barely moving his lips: “I don’t have—” then stops, because the gloved man’s gaze snaps to him like a leash.\n\nKettle’s boots start again, slow, one step up, then another—never crossing fully into the gaslamp’s brightest strip. His body remains mostly out of sight around the corner, but his *shadow* inches forward on the stair treads, testing the edge of the light like it’s feeling for a gap.\n\nKettle speaks again, still from below, voice carrying: “For the record: you’re being offered a clean exit. Don’t make it theatrical, Lorne.”\n\nConcrete threat: the tag on your chain is now a sympathetic anchor at your threshold, and Kettle’s unnatural shadow is probing toward the doorcrack—staying just shy of the lamp-bright line, like it’s waiting for someone to shift, dim the light, or open wider."

Who filed for this ‘clean exit’?” Then, to Tollin in a near-whisper, “If you can’t give me a signatory, give me a *departmental cipher*—one letter. I’ll do the rest.”"

The remaining bristle twitches once, like a cut nerve, then lies still.\n\nThe logging tag itself loosens and slides half an inch down the chain, no longer “hugging” the link. You’ve damaged whatever sympathetic purchase it had, but you haven’t removed the tag entirely; part of the anchor is still present.\n\nFrom below, Kettle’s voice comes up the stairwell, amused in that professional way that never reaches kindness. “Petitioner prefers not to be named.”\n\nHis shadow advances two treads at once—too fast for the pace of his boots. It lengthens toward the doorcrack, thinning as it goes, like ink pulled under a knife. It stops just short of the bright strip cast by the landing lamp, pressing against the light-line as if it’s testing how firm reality is today.\n\nThe gloved man finally answers your “theatrical” remark by pulling a pen from inside his sleeve. Not a fountain pen—something with a blunt nib meant for carbon forms. He taps it against the notice. *Tap tap.* “Sign, and the tag comes off. Refuse, and we start logging what’s inside your office as ‘indecent materials.’”\n\nTollin’s eyes flick to your hand on the chain, then to the damaged bristle, and you see him decide to save himself.\n\nHe whispers, fast and ragged: “Cipher—” He hesitates as the gloved man’s gaze pins him.

His shadow stays pressed to the edge of the lamp-light, poised—waiting for the smallest change: the door opening wider, the lamp guttering, or you stepping back from the threshold.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}"

The paper scrapes softly, a bureaucrat’s whisper.\n\nAt the latch, the tag snags again: the remaining bristle is still threaded through its hole, and the hole is too small to pass over the latch’s thicker metal. You can’t fully strip it without either tearing the tag or opening the door wider. You do manage to pull the tag flush against the inside hardware, tucking it out of the crack’s line—reducing whatever line-of-sight the stairwell has on it.\n\nThe gloved man sees the movement anyway. His pen stops tapping.\n\nKettle answers your raised voice from below, tone flattening into official recitation. “Mediation matter: breach of civic decency by continued pursuit of sealed romantic-ritual deaths. Petitioner alleges harassment of protected mourners.”\n\nAs he says *protected mourners*, his shadow does something new: it spreads sideways along the edge of the lamp-light, like liquid trying to find a seam. It doesn’t cross the bright line—but it begins to *map* it, tracing the boundary as if learning where it will be weakest if the flame gutters.\n\nTollin’s face goes pale at “protected mourners.” That phrase has teeth in the Mourning Office; it means someone important is in the ledger.\n\nYou tell him to walk away.\n\nHe tries.\n\nTollin shifts his weight back, turning his shoulder—then the gloved man’s hand clamps the top of Tollin’s clipboard and yanks him forward half a step, using him like a hooked coat. Tollin makes a small, involuntary sound, and the papers on the board flutter.\n\n“Registrar’s assistant,” the gloved man says quietly, “you’re staying until this is logged.”\n\nThen, to you, still controlled: “For the record, refusal noted. Next step is service and entry with witness.”\n\nHe reaches into his coat and produces a thin brass token stamped with the Mourning Office’s crescent—an entry warrant marker. He doesn’t present it through the crack; he just lets you see it.\n\nDownstairs, Kettle finally comes into partial view: a shoulder, a gloved hand on the banister, and a strip of face in gaslight. He doesn’t climb into the brightest patch. He angles his chin toward your door.\n\nConcrete threat, now immediate: they are moving from “pressure” to “forced entry with a keywright and Bailiff witness.” Kettle’s shadow is actively testing the light boundary, and Tollin has been physically restrained—meaning they’re willing to escalate and create leverage if you don’t comply.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}"

You murmur the unbinding.\n\nThe charm *takes*—but not cleanly.\n\nThe chain doesn’t fall. Instead, the metal goes briefly cold, as if it’s remembering a different shape. The crescent mark under your thumb pales a shade, like chalk rubbed thin. The latch gives a tiny, involuntary click—half a release—then holds, as though something on the other side is keeping tension on it.\n\nOutside, the gloved man hears that click. His head tilts a fraction.\n\nYou speak, level: token through the crack.\n\nHe doesn’t comply. He steps closer, and you see the brass token again, but held back from the gap—displayed for intimidation, not inspection. “You don’t get to audit my marks,” he says. “You get to sign, or you get to be witnessed.”\n\nDownstairs, Bailiff Kettle answers your raised voice without moving into the brightest patch. “Careful with threats, Lorne.”\n\nThen he gives you what you asked for—crookedly, like a bone tossed to a dog. “Initials: **E. S.** That’s all you’re owed.”\n\nThe gloved man’s free hand tightens on Tollin’s clipboard. Tollin flinches, and you hear the board’s clip creak. The registrar’s assistant’s eyes flick to you—pleading, angry, trapped.\n\nKettle continues, voice carrying up the stairwell: “Unsigned notice becomes signed the moment you refuse under service. Keywright’s book won’t help you if the entry is lawful.”\n\nConcrete threat: they’re not negotiating. Kettle is prepared to call a keywright and force the chain, and the gloved man is actively using Tollin as leverage. Your unbinding partially weakened the latch, but the tension from the hallway side is preventing it from releasing fully—meaning if they apply force with tools, your chain will likely give faster than it would have before.  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"Torn logging tag (inside half)\"],\"inventory_remove\":[\"Logging tag (intact)\"],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}"

But it dies loudly in the only way covert things can—by leaving a tell.\n\nOutside, the gloved man’s posture changes. He leans in toward the jamb as if he felt a draft, then raps once—hard—on the wood. “Cute,” he says, voice sharpened. “Add obstruction to the note.”\n\nBelow, Bailiff Kettle calls up, “Keywright—move.”\n\nBoots accelerate. The tool-clink comes closer, now distinct: picks, a tension bar, something heavier that could be a small pry.\n\nYou grab your coat and travel case and cross to the back window. The latch is shut, but it isn’t *latched right*: the hook sits a hair off its seat, and there’s a faint smear of violet-amber residue on the sill—perfume-ink, the same family as your invitation’s binding scent. Someone has had this window open recently and wiped it down badly.\n\nYou ease it up a fraction. Cold salt air pushes in.

They don’t leave. They’re positioned like they’re waiting for you to choose the window.\n\nAt the front door, metal touches metal: the keywright has started working the chain. The latch you half-loosened earlier gives a small, betraying click in response.\n\nThreats are now twofold and concrete: forced entry is underway at the front, and a watcher is posted to catch or follow you if you exit via the back.  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Back service gap (office window)\"],\"npcs_add\":[]}"

You climb—boots finding the drainpipe brackets, hands biting rust. A bracket groans once under your weight; rust flakes into your sleeve. You swing onto a narrow overhang—an ugly little rain-lip above a boarded window. Your knee knocks wood; the board thuds, but holds.\n\nBelow, Mira steps back into the alley and lifts her voice toward the street-mouth, controlled and clear: “Rear line. Up.

What changes is sound: the stairwell’s usual drip and distant radio-prayer feel suddenly far away, as if someone shut a door between you and the building.\n\n“Mira—talk to me.”\n\nNo answer.\n\nYou turn your head as much as you can without breaking the seal. Mira is still on the stairs below—but she’s gone rigid, chin slightly lifted like she’s listening for a name in a crowd. Her hand, the one that held the lantern hook, has loosened. The hook hangs from two fingers, swaying.\n\n“Harrow—status on the line.”\n\nUp above: rope creaks against brick. Harrow’s silhouette shifts. “Line’s good,” he calls down immediately. “You didn’t black out. You’re still with me.” Then, sharper: “Don’t breathe deep. Your sleeve’s soaked.”\n\nKnife-dog isn’t running. He’s staring at Mira with an expression that’s half hunger, half panic—like he recognizes her as an answer to a question he never asked. He takes one involuntary step toward her.\n\nThe lantern-pin clerk has stopped writing. His pencil hovers. He’s looking at Mira too, and his mouth is slightly open, as if he’s about to speak a familiar pet name and can’t remember whose it belongs to.\n\nYou feel it in your own body—not a swoon, not a spell-circle snapping shut, but a **pull**: a thought trying to form around the idea that this moment has always been leading to a particular pairing. It’s not fully in you yet, but it’s at the edge, testing the seams.\n\nBehind your palm, the siphon gives a single stronger **puff**, like it found a new path. The board shifts a hair against your chalk wedge—still closed, but the pressure is actively working it.\n\nThreat, immediate and concrete: the medium is now affecting the people below you first. Mira is on the cusp of a compulsion state; knife-dog and the clerk are being drawn toward her. If anyone touches anyone else while this is in the air, the binding can “take” faster—and if your seal slips, the next vent will hit the whole stairwell."

His eyes keep trying to slide back to Mira anyway, but he forces them to the floorboards. “I’m— I’m sitting. I’m sitting,” he repeats, breath fast.\n\nThe clerk hesitates half a beat too long. Then whatever professional composure he had loses a tooth: he turns his back to Mira and the stairwell, shoulders hunched, and pulls his coat sleeve up over his mouth and nose. His pencil drops and clatters down two steps. “This is— this is highly irregular,” he muffles into wool, but he doesn’t turn back.\n\nHarrow answers with action, not words. The rope jerks—tightens—then starts moving with measured pulls. You hear brick grit as it runs over the parapet above.\n\n“Mira—name five things you can see.”\n\nMira blinks like she’s waking up underwater. Her lips part; no sound at first. Then, on the second try, she speaks—flat, forced, anchoring herself one object at a time.\n\n“Rail. Rust… on the rail.” Swallow. “Your… sleeve. Chalk. The— the clerk’s pin. Knife-dog’s boots.”\n\nThe rope goes taut again. Harrow has hooked it down—using the lantern hook as an ugly improvised lift point. Mira’s fingers clamp reflexively around the hook as it pulls. It bites into her grip; she gasps, pain punching through the haze. Good: pain is reality. Bad: her body is now moving toward you, up the stairwell, through air that’s still contaminated.\n\n“Nobody touches anybody,” Harrow calls down, voice strained with the haul. “I’ve got her. Keep your seal.”\n\nAs Mira rises, the siphon behind your palm gives another insistent **puff**. The board shudders against your wedge. Your chalk-sigil around the nail holes smears where your forearm brushes it—still there, but imperfect.\n\nConcrete threat: Mira is being lifted through the affected air toward the roofline. If the board shifts further, the next vent will hit her full in the face on the way up; if she coughs or panics, she’ll inhale deeper. The clerk and knife-dog are contained for the moment, but both are still in the medium’s reach—one lapse, one touch, and the binding accelerates."

It lands between Mira and the wall in a heavy fold—an improvised curtain that blocks line-of-sight and catches some of the draft. It doesn’t stop the air itself, but it breaks the “seeing” part of whatever’s trying to form.\n\n“Mira—wrap your sleeve—”\n\nShe fumbles, then obeys. Sleeve over nose and mouth. Her breathing goes shallow, ragged but controlled.\n\n“Mother’s name,” you prompt.\n\n“E-Esme,” she says into cloth. “Esme Rook.”\n\n“Last meal.”\n\n“Pickled herring… and bread. Cold.” The answer comes quicker. Her eyes focus on your coat like it’s an instruction sheet.\n\nThe clerk, still facing away, pats his vest with one hand, then his coat. “I have water—work issue,” he says, voice pinched. He crouches, sets something metal on the step, and **rolls** it up the stairs without turning. It bumps twice, then comes to rest a step below Mira’s dangling boots: a dented, municipal canteen stamped with the Mourning Office seal. “No salt,” he adds. “Not on my person.”\n\nYou press your ear to the board.\n\nBehind it, the siphon isn’t a voice—it's infrastructure. You hear a **wet, periodic draw**, like a bellows pulling through a narrow throat, then the faintest slosh answering it. The reservoir isn’t right behind the board; it’s *lower*, feeding upward. Each draw is followed by that thin pressure tick you felt earlier.\n\nAs you listen, the board shifts another fraction against your wedge. Not open—yet—but the seam **breathes**. A cold, perfumed exhale threads out and hits your cheekbone where your seal isn’t perfect.\n\nImmediate consequence: your eyes sting and your throat tightens with the reflex to inhale deeper.\n\nMira, muffled, manages: “If it’s the… Lantern blend? It’s usually… bladdered. Pig bladder or gut-skin. Easy to hide under clothes, under seats. Piped is… municipal. Too loud. Too traceable.”\n\nHarrow swears under his breath. “Vesper—your wedge is walking.”\n\nThreat, clear and present: the feed is coming from below (a hidden bladder or line), and the seam is starting to leak around your ear/cheek. If the board gives any more, the next puff will vent directly into your face and down onto Mira’s position—she’ll take it full, and the clerk and knife-dog will catch the drift a heartbeat later."

She nods once, small, and keeps her breaths shallow into her sleeve.\n\nYou snag the canteen with your boot and drag it up, metal scraping stone. With your free hand you work the cap. It resists—then gives with a sharp twist. Water slaps out in a sloppy sheet onto the seam and runs down into the nail holes, darkening the chalk-sigil to gray paste.\n\nFor a moment the board’s “breathing” changes: the **tick-tick** becomes a dampened **thup**, like the pressure has to push through wet fibers now. The seam swells slightly where the wood drinks.\n\nThen the downside hits. The perfumed medium catches in the wet and starts to **foam** at the edge—tiny pearled bubbles that cling instead of dissipating. The smell intensifies, sweeter and more intimate, because it’s no longer just air; it’s a film.\n\nBelow, the clerk stays faced away, rigid. Knife-dog remains seated, but he begins rocking subtly, heel tapping the stair as if keeping time with a song only he can hear. He does not stand.\n\nYou rasp for a thin blade.\n\nHarrow shifts above; rope creaks. “I’ve got a hook and a penknife,” he calls. “Penknife’s on my belt—can’t drop it clean without losing it. Hook I can lower.”\n\nA second later, something metal scrapes at the parapet. The lantern hook descends on the line, swinging slightly. It’s not a knife tip—more like a blunt, curved beak. Usable for prying or snagging, not for delicate probing.\n\nAs it comes down, the wet seam gives a sudden **spit**—a single bead of black-violet fluid pushes out from one nail hole and slides down your watered chalk, leaving an inky comet trail.\n\nThreat, immediate: your “gasket” is holding back open venting, but it’s concentrating the binding medium into a sticky film that can transfer by touch. If that hook (or your fingers) picks up the foamed residue and then contacts Mira, rope, or your own skin, you risk spreading the compulsion instead of containing it. Also, the feed is still pressurizing from below; the board is still trying to walk.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"Mourning Office canteen (partially used)\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```"

The violet mist beyond the threshold *thins* where the lantern’s light hits it—like breath pulled away from a mirror—then *reforms* in a narrow band around the flame, reluctant but interested.\n\nMira plants the lantern on the curb. She turns and drives her boot into the porter’s shin. “Up. Now.” The porter jolts awake with a strangled yelp and immediately reaches for the rail out of habit—\n\nHarrow barks, “Hands off!” and slaps his wrist away before he makes contact. The porter freezes, wide-eyed, holding his hands up like he’s been accused.\n\nThe clerk—young, ink-stained fingers shaking—stammers, “Ash—yes, yes,” and bolts for a back closet. You hear a drawer ripped open, then a metal scoop clattering. He returns with a tin pail of cold stove-ash and a cracked salt packet pinched from a desk.\n\nHe dumps ash at the banister base and along the stair edge. Where it hits the foam on stone, it doesn’t just dry it—it *scabs* it: the crawling edge stiffens into a gray, granular crust that stops advancing across the step.\n\nBut the two tendrils on the banister don’t die. They tighten, darken, and climb another inch, as if the wood is feeding them something the stone won’t.\n\nOutside, the violet mist hasn’t thickened—it's *redirecting*, subtly leaning toward the lantern’s flame as if listening."

Any ‘cleaning’ with lye or saltwater in the last day?”\n\nI fish a small wax-sealed vial from my kit and, without touching the rail, flick a pinch of salt toward the climbing tendrils to see if it bites or beads. “And where does that banister join the wall—any cracks, rot, or a hollow post?”"

Inside the fold, the trapped line of foam is still chewing—wool fibers go dark, then slick, then vanish into a thin, black paste that *tries* to seep out along the seam. You cinch it tighter and it stays contained, but the coat’s inner hem is now visibly thinning.\n\nMira drags the lantern farther down the curb, slow like you said. The violet mist follows it in a narrow, attentive drift—less a cloud now than a leash.

The landlord had me do it. Two nights ago. Varnish. New coat. Smelled sweet—like flowers over rot.” He licks his lips. “And… saltwater. He said it keeps the wood from swelling in the damp. Poured it right along the posts.”\n\nYou flick a pinch of salt.\n\nThe grains strike the climbing tendrils and—wrongly—*bead*, as if the salt hit oil.

His breathing turns shallow and metered; the lacquer-sheen behind his ear dulls a touch, like a flame starved of air.\n\nThe clerk scrambles, nearly slipping in ash. “Brine—yes—” He bolts up the stairs two at a time, scoop clattering. You hear a cupboard thrown open, ceramic knocking ceramic, then the slosh of liquid. He’s moving fast enough to be useful, but not quietly.\n\nYou slide the warm tinder-tin a handspan farther along the stone.\n\nThe mist obeys the heat. The thick smear that had been orienting toward Harrow’s side peels away and migrates along the ash line toward the tin’s new position, pressing there in repeated, coordinated shoves. The reinforced thin patch under the tray holds. The ash line where the mist now pushes begins to blacken in small crescents—stress marks, not yet a breach.\n\nYou fish out cold iron: your keyring has an old, pitted iron key on it—real iron, not plated. You hold it close to the mark without touching.\n\nThe air around Harrow’s ear prickles. The lacquer-sheen reacts like oil meeting a magnet: it tightens, then dims. Harrow’s eyes squeeze shut for a second, jaw clenched, but he doesn’t pull away. The mist outside falters for half a heartbeat—its “push” stutters—then resumes, harder, as if angry at losing the scent.\n\nYou put the question to the puncture.\n\nThe voice answers immediately, like it’s been waiting to say it:\n\n“The **waltz** that isn’t written down.”\n\n“Three notes. Then the fourth is a **name**.”\n\nIt pauses; the nail scrapes once, slow.\n\n“Played at **Sableglass**. In the pit where the audience can’t see hands. The Lantern’s musician—**Maestro Celyne**—keeps the leash-time.”\n\nAs it finishes, the waxed paper over the puncture draws inward sharply, straining under your tourniquet, and a thin line of damp brine seeps at the cloth edge—pressure building behind the seal.\n\nFootsteps hammer back down the stairs: the clerk returns clutching a squat pickling jar, hands slick. “Salt—salt water,” he pants, holding it out like an offering.\n\nRight now the threats are clear and immediate:\n- The mist is concentrating its force where your tinder-tin sits; that segment of ash line is blackening and weakening.\n- Pressure behind the puncture is increasing; your tourniquet is holding, but it’s being tested.\n- You have brine in hand, and cold iron is damping the mark—temporarily.\n\nNo inventory changes yet (the jar is being held out, not in your possession)."

Not touching—still, the air around the key goes thin and cold. The lacquer-spot answers with a faint, insectile clicking you feel more than hear. Harrow’s jaw locks; he takes the “small breaths” you ordered, shallow and obedient, eyes wide on a point past your shoulder.\n\nThe clerk—sleeves rolled, face gray with the kind of fear that tries to become professionalism—does what you said. Ash pours in a heavy crescent where the blackening was creeping. It doesn’t stop the stain so much as *pins it*; the black edge hesitates, then reroutes along the ash like it’s following a rail.\n\nHe slides the tin tray into place. The moment metal bridges that weak arc, the mist at the boundary buckles inward, like a curtain yanked. A thin line of condensation beads along the tray’s lip—then freezes. The tinder-tin you nudge farther in gives a small, unhappy *ping* as if something tapped it from the other side.\n\nYou cinch the ash-stiffened cloth tighter. Harrow hisses through his teeth. Under the waxed paper, the puncture’s seep changes: not more blood—less. What does leak is darker and syrup-slow, and it carries that violet-amber perfume note, faint but unmistakable.\n\nWhen you murmur into the puncture, the answer doesn’t come from Harrow’s mouth at first. It comes from the lacquer-spot behind his ear, vibrating against your brined fingertips—like a throat trying to speak through sealed lips.\n\nThen Harrow speaks anyway, voice doubled, his own underneath and something smooth riding on top:\n\n“Bodies,” it says, too quickly—then corrects itself with a little laugh that isn’t his. “No. Names that *become* bodies. Couples in ledgers. Seats filled at a theater that isn’t only a theater.”\n\nHis eyes flick to your iron key like it burns.\n\n“Celyne gets… a clean page,” the borrowed voice adds, suddenly strained. “A pardon from the Audit. Permission to keep playing when the city decides music is indecent.”\n\nThe blackening at the ash-crescent twitches, testing the line again—this time pushing a hair-thin tendril toward the clerk’s ankle, slow and deliberate, like it’s learned where the fear is."

Where the droplets land, the hair-thin black line recoils in tight, jerky pulls, like a worm hitting salt. It tries to split around the wet spots—can’t—so it retreats, sliding back toward the ash-crescent with the reluctance of something being shoved into a corner.\n\nYou jab the iron key down beside it. The stone around the keyhead frosts in a coin-sized bloom. The mist doesn’t touch the iron, but it *acts* like it has: the tendril flattens, thins, and slinks backward along the ash rail, tucking itself into the darker patch as if hiding behind a legal technicality.\n\nHarrow’s forehead meets yours—clammy, fever-hot. His pupils jitter. The voice that answers you is still doubled, but now it’s fighting for purchase.\n\n“Which ledger—” Harrow’s own voice starts, then the smooth one cuts in, impatient:\n\n“Lower Registry,” it says. “Room numbers. Ink that bites. Not the public books.”\n\nHarrow swallows hard; his throat works like he’s choking on a word.\n\n“Names of the *nearly* dead,” the smooth voice continues, softer now, as if savoring it. “Names of the *unmourned*. The ones the Office can reclassify. Unregistered grief—easy to move. Easy to pair.”\n\nAt “Sableglass,” the lacquer-spot behind his ear clicks again, faster—warning, not speech.\n\n“The Lantern’s theater,” the voice says, and then—an involuntary flinch—“and under it.”\n\nHarrow’s eyes roll toward the boundary line, then snap back to you like a dog yanked by a chain.\n\n“Under the stage,” he whispers in his own voice, raw and terrified. “A second door. Salt stairs. I saw it once—only once—when they brought in the charity crates. It wasn’t crates.”\n\nThe clerk makes a small sound—half sob, half laugh—and clamps his mouth shut, still staring at you.

I swear I did.”\n\nYou slap the stiffened cloth scrap over the service-gap lip.\n\nThe probing shadow on the other side—thin as a file edge—touches the cloth and *sticks* for half a second. The grid on the fabric sharpens, the right-angled rulings going crisp like a form filling itself in. A cold, inky pressure pushes into the weave, and you feel it through your fingertips: not wet, not dry—like a stamp about to come down.\n\nThen you salt-swipe hard over the metal edge.\n\nThe salt fouls the line, and the shadow recoils, but it doesn’t retreat cleanly. It shears—leaving a small, hooked sliver embedded in the cloth scrap’s grid. The sliver twitches once, like a fishhook testing tension, and the violet-amber scent spikes sharp enough to sting your nose.\n\nInside the gap, the rest of it withdraws with a papery rasp—angry, searching. The opening darkens as if something flat is being pressed across it from the office side, trying to re-establish a “clean” boundary. You’ve bought a moment, not solved it.\n\nHarrow watches the cloth, then the alley, then the ladder. He doesn’t posture—he commits.\n\n“Alley,” he says, low and certain. “Roof gives sightlines to *them*, too. Up there you’re a silhouette against gaslight and fog. Down there—noise, bodies, drains. We can cut the hook.”\n\nAs he says it, you hear boots on the interior stairwell behind the wall—measured, municipal pace. Not running. Coming to check why a record is failing to file.\n\nTollin swallows, eyes fixed on the cloth scrap like it’s now wearing his name. “That—” he whispers. “That’s a retrieval slip. If it gets a full line on you, it’ll follow you to a shelf.”\n\nThe hooked sliver in the cloth gives another small tug—toward Tollin’s wrist.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```"

The second it gives, THROW it.”\n\nWithout turning fully, I bark at the nearer man through the dim glare, “One more step and I open you from wrist to elbow—go fetch your friend’s baton.” Then I angle my shoulder to keep the door between Tollin and the lantern-light, listening for the second man’s splash-line closing in."

The metal complains—high, tight—and the knife flexes alarmingly. When you stomp-kick the lock body, the impact shocks through the hasp with a sharp *clang*.\n\nThe lock doesn’t pop. It *does* shift: the hasp plate bends a hair, and the padlock rotates, opening the shackle gap just enough that your blade bites deeper. Your knife edge skitters and you feel it notch—one more like that and it may snap or dull beyond use.\n\n“Harrow—ready on the bolt.”\n\nHarrow plants both hands on the bolt handle, body coiled. “Ready,” he says, voice thin.\n\nYour threat to the nearer man lands, but not the way you want.\n\nHe doesn’t back off. He stops for half a beat, eyes on your knife at the lock, then he *moves sideways* instead of forward—angling to get a line past you toward Tollin. His hand comes up with the short blade from his belt, held low and tight.\n\n“Don’t bluff with a door,” he says. “You’ll break before it does.”\n\nThe lantern in his other hand lifts higher, trying to flood the corner with light. It catches Tollin’s face for an instant; Tollin flinches but keeps his hands clamped over his mouth.\n\nThen the second man arrives—splashing hard, no subtlety now—and his voice comes from your left, closer than you expected: “Back corner!”\n\nHe hasn’t come straight at you; he’s looping wide, trying to cut off the service door from the side. In his hand, you see the baton again—retrieved from under the crate edge—dark with slime.\n\nImmediate threats are now clear and split:\n- **Knife-man** is five to six feet away, sliding for an angle on Tollin.\n- **Baton-man** is coming in from your left flank, close enough to rush in the next second or two.\n\nHarrow is still braced on the bolt, waiting for the lock to give.

The shoot-bolt itself is solid iron and could be used as a lever if Harrow can get purchase under the hasp.\n\nYou lunge.\n\nYour hand clamps the lantern-man’s wrist and you yank hard down and sideways, driving the lantern toward the water. He reacts instantly—drops his weight, twists his elbow, and **lets the lantern go** rather than let you control his arm.\n\nThe lantern hits the water with a heavy splash. The flame gutters violently behind wet glass—**not out, but choking**, throwing frantic, strobing light across the cellar.\n\nAt the same time you kick behind his ankle. Your boot clips him, but he’s already shifting; he **stumbles** instead of folding, catching himself with a wet slap of his palm on a crate corner. He snarls and comes up with his knife hand ready, now unencumbered by the lantern.\n\n“Harrow—forget the lock—lever the hasp—tear it!”\n\nHarrow obeys—fast. He rips at the shoot-bolt bar, jams it under the bent hasp plate, and heaves. Metal shrieks. The hasp plate begins to peel away from the doorframe—**one screw head pops**, spinning out into the water.\n\nBut that noise is a bell.\n\nThe baton-man takes it as his moment and **rushes your left flank**, baton swinging low-to-high for your ribs/arm. You see it coming in the strobing lantern-light: the strike is imminent, close enough you’ll feel it if you don’t move.\n\nThe lantern-man steps in too, knife forward, trying to pin you in place while the baton lands. Tollin stays frozen against the wall, muffled breathing behind his hands. Harrow is still levering—hasp half-torn, but the door is not open yet."

It’s a deadened hit, still hard enough to make your arm go briefly numb.\n\nYour momentum carries both of you into the doorframe area. Water splashes up your shins. The baton-man grunts, stumbles, and tries to turn his body to keep the baton between you and him.\n\n“Harrow—NOW, tear it!”\n\nHarrow bears down on the bolt bar like he’s trying to pry the city open. The bent hasp plate gives with a ripping metallic shriek—**a second screw tears free**, leaving the plate hanging by one twisted fastener. The padlock swings uselessly against it.\n\nNot open yet—but it’s **seconds from failing**.\n\nYou slash quick and shallow at the baton-man’s wrist/forearm. The blade bites; not deep, but enough to draw a bright ribbon of blood in the lantern’s frantic strobe. His hand spasms.\n\nHe **doesn’t drop the baton**—he clamps harder, teeth bared, and uses the pain to fuel a dirty counter: he **drives his shoulder into you**, trying to pin you against the door hardware and keep you from protecting Tollin.\n\nAt the same time the lantern-man closes, exploiting your tie-up. He steps in from your right with his knife low and forward, aiming for the gap under your ribs—then checks at the last instant when your angled body blocks his line to Tollin.\n\n“Move,” he hisses, not to you—past you, to the baton-man. “Get him off the door.”\n\nTollin, seeing the knife come in, finally breaks his freeze: he makes a small, panicked sound behind his hands and **slides sideways along the wall**, trying to get behind Harrow—but he’s exposed for a heartbeat in the strobing light.\n\nHarrow gives one last heave. The remaining fastener **begins to tear**, metal bending outward. The door is about to come free, but right now you’re being **pressed into the threshold** by the baton-man while the knife-man is **within stabbing distance** on your right, hunting an opening."

His shoulder clips the lantern-man’s knife arm, **spoiling the stab** into a glancing scrape that bites fabric and skin along your right side instead of sinking in. It still burns hot; you feel blood immediately, warm under the cold damp.\n\nThe baton-man slams into the knife-man’s chest. The knife-man curses, boots skidding in the water, and he **shoves his ally off** with his forearm. “Idiot—watch your feet!”\n\n“Harrow—OPEN! Tollin, GO—NOW!”\n\nHarrow answers with a grunt and one last heave. The final fastener tears with a shriek and the hasp plate **rips free**. The padlock and plate clatter into the water. The door lurches inward an inch, then sticks—swollen wood. Harrow shoulder-checks it and it **gives**, opening into a narrow service passage beyond, darker and drier.\n\nTollin moves on your command—stumbles through the gap, nearly trips on the threshold, catches himself on the far wall, and keeps going, breath coming in sharp, panicked pulls.\n\nYou shove him fully clear and pivot after, knife up, backpedaling into the passage to keep the opening between you and them.\n\nThey don’t let you have space.\n\nThe baton-man, limping, **charges the threshold** and swings the baton in a short, brutal arc aimed at your knife hand.
