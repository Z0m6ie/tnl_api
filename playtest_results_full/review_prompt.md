## Your Task

Analyze these playthroughs and identify issues and improvements in the following categories:

### 1. Narrative Issues
- Contradictions in the story (events, facts, or details that conflict)
- NPCs acting out of character or inconsistently
- Plot holes or loose threads that were never resolved
- Inconsistent world details (locations, rules, history)
- Tone breaks (e.g., comedy in horror, jarring mood shifts)
- Pacing problems (too fast, too slow, anticlimactic)

### 2. Recall Problems
- AI forgetting previous events that were clearly established
- Characters forgetting what was said earlier in conversation
- Inventory items appearing/disappearing incorrectly
- Location confusion (describing wrong place, inconsistent geography)
- NPC names or details changing without explanation
- Player character traits or abilities being forgotten

### 3. Simulation Issues
- Hidden elements (watchers, guards, traps) revealing too easily or never triggering
- Consequences not matching the severity of actions
- Timed events progressing incorrectly or not at all
- Scene transitions being awkward or illogical
- Triggers firing at inappropriate times

### 4. Player Experience Issues
- Confusing or ambiguous game outputs
- Dead ends with no clear options
- Overly punishing or trivially easy challenges
- Lack of agency (player choices don't seem to matter)
- Poor romantic tension buildup (for romance genres)
- Character chemistry falling flat

### 5. Genre-Specific Issues
- Romance: Does the romantic tension build naturally? Are love interests compelling?
- Mystery: Are clues planted fairly? Is the reveal satisfying?
- Horror: Is tension maintained? Are scares earned?
- Adventure: Is exploration rewarding? Are challenges engaging?

### 6. Improvements Needed
- Suggest specific prompt changes
- Identify missing mechanics or systems
- Recommend new simulation elements
- Propose better handling of specific situations

#### Turn 4 **[PLAYER]**

Nyx Calder, once a clockmaker’s apprentice who vanished into the city’s fog-laced underworks, returned with pockets full of impossible gears and half-remembered dreams. Now a rogue “aether-runner” and sabotage artist for hire, she slips through vented rooftops and velvet-lit canals to crack vaults no blueprint admits exist. Unpredictable, slyly charismatic, and recklessly curious, Nyx treats every rule like a suggestion whispered by a dying machine. She’s chasing the rumored Somnograph Engine—not for profit, but to rewrite the one night she can’t wake from.

#### Turn 5 **[GAME]**

Here's your character:

**Nyx Calder**
*Aether-runner and sabotage artist for hire (heist infiltrator/lockbreaker)*

Raised in the soot-bright workshops of Brasswater, Nyx apprenticed under a meticulous clockmaker until she vanished into the fog-laced underworks after a job went wrong and her memories began to fracture. She resurfaced months later with impossible gears that hum with aether and dream-logic, along with a half-remembered night that loops in her sleep. Since then, she’s lived between rooftops, canals, and hidden service tunnels, trading sabotage for secrets while the city’s machines seem to recognize her like an old mistake.

**Traits:** Unpredictably inventive, Slyly charismatic, Recklessly curious, Cool under pressure, Rule-averse and improvisational
**Goal:** Find the rumored Somnograph Engine and use it to rewrite the one night she can’t wake from—before the city’s dream-eaten machinery (and whoever built the Engine) rewrites her first.

Juno grew up in the soot-bright underlevels of Aerolith City, running errands through pipe-tunnels and clockwork service corridors where the law rarely followed. After a botched job for a guild of dream-distillers, Juno discovered an odd talent: slipping into the city's shared dreamscape to scout places that can’t be mapped in waking life. Now they take jobs with a shrug and a grin, but they never forget who still holds their old debt.

**Traits:** Unflappable, Improvisational, Street-smart, Dryly humorous, Secretive
**Goal:** Pull off one flawless score that buys their freedom from the dream-distillers—then burn the ledger that proves they ever belonged to anyone.

Eldra “Moth” Quillwhisper grew up in a candlelit monastery-library where the ink sometimes rearranged itself into new stories. A wandering lantern-scribe, she roams graveyards, mushroom rings, and moonlit ruins to catalogue oddities that refuse to stay still. Inquisitive, bright-eyed, and gently irreverent, she treats even curses like puzzles begging to be solved.

#### Turn 9 **[GAME]**

Night settles over **Larkspur Gate**, the eastern entrance to the **Old Necropolis**, where the curfew bells have just stopped and the last living visitors hurry out. Violet-dark fog clings to the stone path. The air tastes of wet paper and candle wax. Bone chimes on the gate shiver in the wind, each one striking a different note.

You stand just inside the arch, half-hidden behind a leaning angel marker, with your reliquary lamp hooded under your cloak. On your knee is a sheet of warded paper, and you write by touch as much as by sight—short lines, neat brackets, careful hashes. You compare the copied puddle-text to the ink that bled sideways into a crude margin-map: three circled mausoleums, one marked with a moth-wing sigil. You check the lamp’s wick-oil level like a ritual, then close your satchel before any wax-scent can carry.

Bootsteps scrape stone. A **Warden-Scribe** rounds the gatepost with a shuttered lantern and a slate badge of the **Candlelit Concord** pinned to his chest; his glove is stained with sealing wax. Behind him, a younger acolyte drags a canvas sack that clinks with confiscated lamps. The Warden stops a mourner ahead of you and says, flat and practiced, “Curfew inspection. Satchels open. Pages first.” The mourner’s journal is taken, thumbed, and dropped into the sack. The Warden’s eyes lift, catching the edge of your satchel strap, and his hand settles on the seal-stamp at his belt.

At the same time, a **Grave-Gild courier** slips through the bars of the gate like he belongs there: neat coat, gold-flecked gloves, and a mourning ribbon pinned too carefully. He doesn’t look at the Warden. He looks straight at you and extends a black envelope sealed with funerary gold. On the wax is a thumbprint you recognize from the monastery’s restricted stacks—someone who should be dead. The courier murmurs, “**Vigil-Auction. Lot Thirteen. Candle-authenticated.** They’re reading it aloud tonight.” He nods once toward the necropolis paths, where the stones ahead seem to repeat the same epitaph twice.

The Warden steps closer, lantern angled to your hands. The courier’s envelope waits, warm from his palm. Your lamp, your notes, and your name are all suddenly in reach of other people.

#### Turn 10 **[PLAYER]**

I let my satchel hang open with exaggerated innocence, keeping my warded papers tucked under my knee. With my other hand, I accept the black envelope like it’s merely a receipt and murmur to the courier, “Lot Thirteen—whose voice are they ‘reading’ tonight?” Then I look up at the Warden-Scribe and say, “Of course—pages first. Are you confiscating, or simply inspecting?”

*Agent reasoning: The Warden’s about to search me, but that envelope’s seal is a bigger mystery—someone “dead” is calling. I’ll play compliant to avoid escalation while quietly taking the message and probing for details.*

#### Turn 11 **[GAME]**

Your satchel gapes obligingly—empty mouth, honest lining. The Warden-Scribe’s lantern sweeps it anyway, light probing seams as if expecting ink to flinch. His eyes narrow at the absence.

The courier lets you take the black envelope. The wax seal doesn’t crack; it sticks to your thumb for a heartbeat like it recognizes skin. At your question, he leans close enough that his breath smells faintly of clove and grave-dust.

“Whose voice?” he repeats softly, as if tasting a forbidden word. “A *borrowed one*. They’ve hired a throat—someone who can read without *owning* the text. But the Atlas-leaf… it prefers the voice of the one who died with the thumbprint.” His gaze flicks to the seal, then away. “If that voice answers, the room goes very quiet.”

The Warden-Scribe steps in, putting himself between you and the gate’s shadow. “Inspecting,” he says, and the word is a verdict. He holds out his free hand—palm up—while his other thumb rests on the edge of his seal-stamp. “Pages. Any loose sheets. Any copied epitaphs. Any invitations.”

Behind him, the younger acolyte shifts the canvas sack; glass clinks again—at least a dozen lamps already taken.

The courier straightens, suddenly all professional distance. He does not intervene. He simply tucks his hands behind his back and looks at the Warden as if you’ve become a transaction concluded.

The Warden’s lantern tilts downward and catches the edge of the paper under your knee—a pale corner, too clean against wet stone. He sees it. His eyes sharpen.

“Stand,” he says, voice lower. “Move your knee.”

The immediate threat is plain: if you don’t, he’s close enough to grab your leg or stamp a sealing mark onto whatever you’re hiding; if you do, he’ll likely seize the warded sheet—and your satchel is already open, ready to be “found” wanting.

#### Turn 12 **[PLAYER]**

I rise smoothly, “Of course,” and as I lift my knee I slide the warded sheet up under my cloak against my thigh, letting the black envelope fall onto the stone where the paper had been. I offer Halven Rook the envelope with two fingers. “An invitation, then—shall we see whose funeral it belongs to, Warden?”

*Agent reasoning: If I stand, he’ll take the warded sheet; if I refuse, he’ll escalate. I’ll comply but swap what he sees—use the envelope as a decoy and keep the warded paper stuck to me.*

#### Turn 13 **[GAME]**

You stand. The warded sheet slides up clean under your cloak—no snag, no flutter—pressed to your thigh by the weight of the fabric. Halven Rook’s lantern follows the motion a fraction too late; he sees only your cloak settle.

The black envelope drops onto the wet stone with a soft slap. Gold-seal up.

Halven’s gaze goes straight to it. He doesn’t reach for it immediately. Instead, he lowers his lantern until the flame-light skims the seal and makes the thumbprint shine like an oil-slick. His jaw tightens.

“A Vigil-Auction mark,” he says, and the word “auction” comes out like a charge.

You offer it with two fingers. Halven takes it, but not from your hand—he snatches it off the stone with a strip of waxed cloth from his sleeve, as if the seal might carry contagion. He turns it once, reads the edge-script, then looks past you to the Grave-Gild courier.

The courier’s polite mask holds. He gives a tiny bow that means *no names will be spoken here*.

Halven’s seal-stamp comes out. He presses it against the envelope’s flap—hard enough to crease the paper—then speaks a short Concord phrase under his breath. The stamp leaves a pale, chalky sigil that *binds the flap shut* without breaking the gold wax.

“Confiscated,” Halven says plainly. “Syndicate paper doesn’t leave my custody.”

Acolyte Senn steps forward and opens the canvas sack. Halven drops the sealed envelope in. It lands among glass and metal with a dull clink.

Then Halven lifts the lantern to your face. “Now,” he says, “the page you were kneeling on. You moved too carefully for an innocent mourner.”

His free hand grips your satchel strap near your shoulder and gives a testing tug—enough to pull you off balance if you resist, not enough to look like an arrest to anyone watching.

Threat, clear and immediate: Halven is about to search you physically, and the warded sheet under your cloak will be found if he pats you down.

```json
{"inventory_add":[],"inventory_remove":["Black envelope sealed with funerary gold (unopened)"],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":[],"npcs_add":[]}
```

#### Turn 14 **[PLAYER]**

I go a little wide-eyed and let my satchel strap slip in his grip as if I’m compliant—then I hiss, “Careful—Concord ink burns when mishandled,” and quickly draw out a blank warded sheet from my satchel, snapping it open between us like a shield. “If you insist on inspection, Warden, do it by the book: you touch the paper, not me—unless you want your stamp-hand itching for a week.”

*Agent reasoning: Halven’s about to pat me down; I need to redirect his attention and get space. Causing a “warded paper” incident might make him step back and focus on procedure, not my thigh.*

#### Turn 15 **[GAME]**

Your satchel strap slides through Halven’s grip without a struggle. For half a breath he looks satisfied—then your hand darts in and comes out with a **blank warded sheet**, snapped open so sharply it makes a papery *crack* between you and his lantern.

The warding takes the light oddly. Halven’s flame skates across the sheet and refuses to settle; the edges show a faint, milk-white filigree like dried salt. The air between you both pricks, as if a nettle-brush passed through it.

Acolyte Senn flinches and yanks the confiscation sack back a step, glass clinking. The Grave-Gild courier’s eyes flick to the sheet and then away, as if he’s seen this trick used to hide uglier things.

Halven stops tugging the strap. He holds very still, lantern raised, seal-stamp poised but not advancing. Your warning lands: not fear, but calculation.

“By the book,” he repeats, and there’s a thin edge of irritation. “You’re quoting Concord procedure like you’ve worn our wick-smoke.”

He does not touch the sheet with his bare hand. Instead, he takes the same waxed cloth he used on the envelope and lays it over his fingers, then reaches—slowly—to pinch the top corner of your “shield.”

The cloth smokes faintly where it contacts the warding. Halven’s eyes tighten; he feels it through the fabric.

“Cute,” he says. “Blank wards are for transport, not for posturing.”

Then he changes tactics. He doesn’t try to grab you. He angles his lantern down and to the side, casting light past the sheet to your cloak and thigh—searching for the *shadow* of what you’re still hiding. Senn, taking the cue, steps around to your left to get a second angle.

The threat becomes immediate and specific: they’re setting up a two-sided inspection to spot the concealed sheet under your cloak without laying a hand on you, and if either sees the outline, Halven can lawfully detain you for “concealment during curfew inspection.”

#### Turn 16 **[PLAYER]**

I flick my reliquary lamp open just a thumb’s width so it gutters a sickly, distracting light, then step toward Halven as if to let him “see better,” turning my hip so the cloak sways—slipping the hidden sheet down into my boot with my heel. “Detain me if you must, Warden, but tell me this first—why are you binding Vigil-Auction mail without even breaking the seal? Afraid of what it would *say* in your own lanternlight?”

*Agent reasoning: They’re trying to silhouette the hidden sheet; I should remove the “evidence” without looking like I’m hiding it—using the blank ward as cover and a bit of misdirection with my lamp and a question to split their focus.*

#### Turn 17 **[GAME]**

You crack your reliquary lamp a thumb’s width.

The light that leaks out is wrong for Concord craft—sickly, green-gold, like candlefat over pondwater. It doesn’t brighten so much as *edit*: Halven’s lantern-shadow stutters; the warded sheet in your hands shows its filigree more sharply; the wet stones briefly mirror a face that isn’t yours and then smear into unreadable script.

Senn gasps and reflexively draws back, blinking hard. Halven’s pupils pinch. He lifts his lantern higher, instinctively trying to dominate your guttering glow.

You step in—close enough that Halven has to either retreat or look like he’s being crowded. Your cloak sways with the movement. Your heel hooks, and the hidden warded sheet slides down, down—then catches.

It doesn’t go neatly into your boot. The edge snags on the boot’s inner seam and folds. A corner remains visible for a heartbeat, white as a tongue.

Halven sees it.

His hand shoots out—not to touch your body, but to clamp the *waxed cloth* over that exposed corner and pin it against your boot, using the cloth as a legal fig-leaf. The warding bites back: the cloth smokes again, and Halven’s stamp-hand twitches as if stung.

“Concealment,” he says, voice snapping into official cadence. “Curfew inspection. Concord custody.”

Senn moves to your other side and produces a thin cord marked with tiny candle-sigils—ready to loop it around your wrists if Halven gives the nod.

Your question lands anyway. Halven’s mouth tightens, and for the first time he looks genuinely wary of your lamp.

“I didn’t break the seal,” he says, low, “because I don’t let Syndicate words *choose a reader* under my light. That’s how they plant hauntings in honest throats.”

The Grave-Gild courier finally speaks, mild as a eulogy. “Warden Rook. Please. She’s making a scene.”

Halven doesn’t look at him. His eyes stay on your lamp-slit and the smoking cloth at your boot.

Threat, immediate: Halven is about to pull the warded sheet free (it may tear and scream its warding), and Senn is poised to bind you. If your lamp opens further, it may draw epitaph-spirits already drifting toward lamplight at the gate.

```json
{"inventory_add":["Reliquary lamp (Concord-made)","Blank warded sheet (in hand)","Warded sheet with map-margin (partly pinned at boot; not secured)"],"inventory_remove":[],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":[],"npcs_add":[]}
```

#### Turn 18 **[PLAYER]**

I snap my lamp shut and lift both hands, the blank warded sheet held up like a surrender flag. “Easy—don’t pull it. I’ll take it out myself, slowly, and you can witness every inch.”  

I glance to the courier. “You hear him—Syndicate words choosing a reader. Lot Thirteen does that, doesn’t it?” Then back to Halven, voice softer: “Tell me what haunting you’ve seen come out of a sealed letter, Warden, and I’ll stop making a scene.”

*Agent reasoning: I don’t want them yanking the warded sheet and triggering it; better to control the removal, keep them talking, and use the courier as a wedge. I’ll de-escalate just enough to avoid being bound while fishing for why Halven’s so afraid of “chosen readers.”*

#### Turn 19 **[GAME]**

You snap the reliquary lamp shut. The sickly leak of light dies instantly, and the night’s normal bruise-violet returns. The stuttering shadows steady.

Halven exhales through his nose—relief he won’t admit to. Senn’s shoulders drop a fraction, though the cord stays ready in his hand.

You lift both hands. The blank warded sheet rises with them, stark and harmless-looking.

Halven keeps the waxed cloth pinned over the exposed corner at your boot. He doesn’t yank. He leans in just enough to make his authority felt and says, tight and clear: “Slow. Two fingers. No sudden folds.”

He nods once to Senn, who steps closer—not to bind you, but to watch your hands and the boot at the same time. The courier remains where he is, but his weight shifts onto his back foot, like he’s preparing to vanish the moment this turns.

Your question about Lot Thirteen makes the courier’s smile finally crack. He doesn’t answer directly. He says, carefully, “I only carry invitations, Lantern-scribe. Lots are for bidders.”

Halven’s eyes flick to the courier—sharp, accusatory—then back to you. Your softer question hooks him harder than the lamp did.

“A sealed letter came through Larkspur Gate last month,” Halven says. “Funerary gold. Concord-safe on the outside. Inside was a single line—just one—meant for a clerk named Iver.”

His stamp-hand flexes once, involuntarily.

“Iver read it under lanternlight. He laughed—like he’d remembered a joke from childhood. Then his mouth started writing it again. On his own teeth.” Halven’s voice stays level, but his throat works. “We held him down. The words kept trying to finish themselves on anyone who looked too closely. Three acolytes went blind for a week. One still won’t open his mouth in chapel.”

He taps the cloth pinned to your boot-corner. “So no. I don’t break seals that want to be read.”

As he speaks, the air near the gate grows subtly attentive—thin, hungry. Not visible yet, but you feel it: the way lamplight earlier had *called* to something. If this drags on, whatever drifts near curfew inspections will notice the warding and come closer.

Immediate threat: you’re being allowed to extract the hidden sheet, but if you hesitate or it tears, Halven will declare it a hostile ward and Senn will bind you on the spot.

#### Turn 20 **[PLAYER]**

“Two fingers. No folds. Understood.” I crouch slowly, pinch the exposed corner, and ease the warded sheet up and out of my boot in one smooth pull, keeping it flat and well away from your lanternlight.  

I hold it edge-on for Halven to see it’s just a map-margin ward, then offer it to his cloth-covered fingers. “Witnessed, Warden—take it if you must. But tell me: that line meant for Iver… do you remember even a word of it?”  

And without looking away from Halven, I call to the courier, “Don’t drift off—if Lot Thirteen ‘prefers the voice of the one who died with the thumbprint,’ who was that thumbprint?”

*Agent reasoning: Halven’s giving me a narrow opening—if I move carefully I keep my freedom and maybe earn trust. I also want to learn more about Lot Thirteen and the “teeth-writing” haunting, so I’ll comply while talking and keep the courier from slipping away.*

#### Turn 22 **[PLAYER]**

I crouch slowly and, with two fingers, ease the warded sheet out of my boot in one smooth pull, keeping it flat and angled away from Halven Rook’s lantern. “Witnessed, Warden—shall I place it on the stone for your cloth, or do you want to take it from the edge?”

*Agent reasoning: The scene seems to have reset/blanked; I’ll re-establish where we are by cautiously continuing the last intended action and asking for clarification if needed.*

#### Turn 23 **[GAME]**

The warded sheet slides free in one smooth pull. No tear, no snag—just the soft rasp of paper against leather. The moment it clears your boot, the warding wakes like a held breath: the inked margin-map on it darkens a shade, and the air around its edges feels slightly colder, as if the sheet is insisting on its own boundaries.

Halven doesn’t reach with bare fingers. He keeps the waxed cloth between himself and the paper and answers immediately, clipped: “Stone. Flat. Don’t let it kiss my lantern.”

Senn shifts to your left to block any line-of-sight from the gate road, cord still looped in his hand but lowered. The Grave‑Gild courier takes one careful step back, eyes fixed on the sheet like it might suddenly read him.

You lay the paper on the damp stone path. Moisture beads around it but doesn’t soak in; the warding sheds the wet like oil. Halven lowers his cloth-covered palm and pins one corner—firm, controlled—then slides the cloth under the edge with the practiced motion of someone who’s confiscated dangerous pages before. He does *not* lift it fully yet. He tests it, as if listening for a reaction.

Nothing screams. No flare of light. Just a faint, dry whisper—like turning a page in an empty room.

Halven nods once. “Good. That’s a map-ward. Not a letter-ward.”

Then, from beyond Larkspur Gate, a sound threads in: the soft scrape of something moving over carved names—like fingernails over epitaphs. It’s distant, but it’s coming closer, drawn not by your lamp now, but by the *exposed warding* on the stone.

Senn hears it too. His head snaps toward the gate, and he murmurs, “Warden… something’s paging.”

Halven’s eyes stay on the sheet as his posture tightens. “We’re done lingering,” he says, and finally lifts the paper—still through the cloth—bringing it up to chest height, away from the ground.

Threat, clear and present: an epitaph-spirit (or several) is approaching the gate, attracted by the warded page being out in the open. If it reaches you before this ends, it will try to “read” whatever it can—paper, breath, or skin.

#### Turn 24 **[PLAYER]**

I glance toward the gate, listening hard, then back to Halven. “If it’s paging, don’t carry that sheet bare in the open—wrap it in the cloth and tuck it against your lantern’s backplate; keep its edges from ‘calling.’”

I edge closer to the gate stones without crossing the threshold, palm hovering over my reliquary lamp. “Senn—do you have grave-salt or a name-iron nail? I can scribe a quick hush-ring on the path if you’ll lend me a pinch.”

Then, quietly to Halven: “If you’ve seen letters make teeth write, Warden… who taught you to spot a seal that ‘chooses a reader’?” I cut my eyes to the courier. “And you—stay where I can see you. What exactly is Lot Thirteen buying that needs an invitation carried like a funeral?”

*Agent reasoning: A spirit is approaching and Halven is ending the standoff; I want to both investigate what’s “paging” and keep everyone from getting read. I’ll offer a practical warding step, ask a pointed question, and try to keep the courier from slipping away.*

#### Turn 26 **[PLAYER]**

I angle my body toward the gate and listen, then nod sharply at Halven. “Wrap the sheet fully in that cloth—no edges showing—and hold it against your lantern’s backplate; don’t let it ‘call’ on the air.”  

I step to the gate stones without crossing, my hand hovering over my reliquary lamp. “Senn—grave-salt? a name-iron nail? Lend me a pinch and I’ll scribe a hush-ring on the path.”  

Then I lower my voice to Halven, eyes flicking between him and the courier. “Who taught you to spot a seal that *chooses a reader*, Warden—and what is Lot Thirteen buying that needs an invitation carried like a funeral?”

*Agent reasoning: Something is “paging” from beyond the gate, drawn to the exposed warding; I want to reduce the paper’s call, set a quick ward, and interrogate both Halven and the courier while they’re pressured and more likely to slip.*

#### Turn 27 **[GAME]**

Halven takes your warning like an order he wishes he’d given first. He folds the waxed cloth over the warded sheet twice—tight, corners tucked—until no paper-edge shows. Then he turns his lantern slightly and presses the wrapped bundle against the lantern’s backplate where the metal is coolest, cinching it there with his forearm.

The scraping beyond Larkspur Gate dulls immediately, as if whatever was coming has lost the thread. It doesn’t stop—just becomes uncertain, circling.

You step up to the gate stones, still on the city side. The threshold’s old ward-line—salt and candle soot ground into the mortar—prickles faintly in your teeth as you near it.

Senn blinks at your request, then fumbles at his belt pouch. “Grave-salt, yes—name-iron, no.” He pours a pinch into his palm and holds it out without stepping past Halven. The salt is gray, gritty, and threaded with tiny black flecks like peppered ash.

As you take it, the courier shifts—one foot edging sideways, measuring distance to the road. Halven’s head snaps up. “Don’t,” he says, and the lantern’s light hardens on the courier’s chest like a bar.

You lower your voice. Halven answers yours without looking away from the gate.

“Who taught me?” He taps two fingers against the lantern’s rim. “Restricted stacks. Before the Concord decided certain lessons were ‘unhealthy.’ A dead mentor, if you want poetry.”

At “dead,” the courier’s throat works. He keeps his hands visible, but his eyes flick to the invitation seal at his own belt like it’s burning.

“And Lot Thirteen?” Halven’s mouth tightens. “An ‘Atlas-leaf,’ they say. Authenticated by candlelight.” He gives the courier a hard glance. “Which is a polite way of saying: *they want a page that reacts to a particular flame.*”

The courier finally speaks, voice thin. “It’s not— it’s just paper. The Syndicate wants buyers who can pay for quiet.”

From the necropolis side, the scraping becomes clearer again—now joined by a wet inhaling sound, like someone trying to breathe through soil. A pale shape drifts between headstones inside the gate: a loose column of cemetery mist threaded with faint letterforms. It pauses at the ward-line, then leans, as if sniffing for the “call” you just muffled.

You have grave-salt in hand, a spirit testing the threshold, and Halven carrying your warded sheet wrapped against his lantern.

#### Turn 28 **[PLAYER]**

I kneel at the city-side edge of the ward-line and sprinkle the grave-salt in a thin crescent, then trace a quick hush-ring sigil with two fingers on the stone. Without looking up, I murmur toward the mist, “No pages for you tonight—tell me what name you’re sniffing for, and I’ll leave a proper epitaph instead.”

I glance up sharply at the courier. “Hands off that seal. If your ‘particular flame’ is what it wants, say whose funeral-light you’re carrying—now.”

*Agent reasoning: The spirit is testing the threshold; I want to reinforce the ward-line with the grave-salt and learn what it’s “reading” while keeping the courier from bolting.*

#### Turn 29 **[GAME]**

The grave-salt falls in a thin crescent along the city-side edge of the ward-line. Where each grain lands, the damp stone dries in pinprick spots, as if the salt is drinking the night. When you drag two fingers through it, tracing the hush-ring, the grit bites your skin—then warms, leaving a faint, chalky sigil that *doesn’t* glow so much as refuse to be ignored.

The effect is immediate and plain: the scraping on the necropolis side drops to a muffled, frustrated rub, like a quill pressed against closed wax. The pale mist-column at the threshold leans in—then stops short as if it’s met a pane of glass. Letterforms in its body shiver and try to align into words, but the hush-ring keeps them from “catching” in the air.

Your murmur draws it anyway. The mist compresses, tightens, and a voice comes through like damp paper forced to speak:

“Q—Quill… whisper…” It mispronounces, tasting the syllables. “LAMP… BACKPLATE… CLOTH… WRONG.”

It isn’t sniffing for a *tomb* name. It’s sniffing for *yours*—and for the warded sheet Halven wrapped away.

Behind you, Halven shifts his stance to put himself between the gate and you, lantern angled low. “Moth,” he says quietly, using the monastery-name like a warning. “It’s keyed to you.”

At your sharp look and command, the courier’s hands freeze mid-hover near his belt. Then—too late to pretend—he swallows and answers.

“Vellumwake,” he says. “Funeral-light from Vellumwake Row. The Syndicate keeps a wick from there for ‘authentication.’ Lot Thirteen wants proof the leaf *answers* to that flame.”

As he says it, the invitation seal at his belt gives a tiny, involuntary *click*, like a locket snapping open by itself. A hairline seam appears in the funerary gold wax—no one touched it, but it’s reacting to the word and the nearby lanternlight.

The mist at the threshold jerks toward that sound. It can’t cross your hush-ring, but it stretches, thinning into a long, reaching tongue of fog threaded with script, probing for any gap in the ward-line.

Threat is now specific: if the invitation seal opens fully, whatever is “bound” to that funerary gold will have a line to pull on—possibly enough to drag the spirit’s attention past the ward and onto you on the city side.

#### Turn 30 **[PLAYER]**

“Halven—smother that lantern for a breath, just enough to starve the seal’s appetite, and keep the wrapped sheet pinned cold.”

I snatch a thicker pinch of the grave-salt and flick it in a tight circle around the courier’s boots, then point two fingers at his belt. “Don’t you touch it. Kneel—slowly—and turn the seal outward where I can see it.”

Without taking my eyes off the seam in the wax, I speak to the mist through the hush-ring. “You’ve got my monastery-name in your mouth—who wrote it there? Give me the scribe’s name, and I’ll trade you a clean epitaph to chew instead of my breath.”

*Agent reasoning: The seal is reacting and could become a conduit; I want to stop it opening, learn what the spirit wants from “Quillwhisper,” and use my lamp/wards to reinforce the threshold while questioning everyone.*

#### Turn 31 **[GAME]**

Halven doesn’t argue. He hooks a thumb over his lantern’s shutter and clamps it down hard.

For one breath the light dies to a bruised ember-glow, and the air near the courier’s belt *relaxes*—that hairline seam in the funerary-gold wax stops widening. The tiny click you heard doesn’t repeat. Halven keeps the cloth-wrapped sheet pinned tight to the lantern’s backplate with his forearm, pressing it to the metal like he’s cooling a fever.

Your thicker pinch of grave-salt snaps out in a tight circle around the courier’s boots. The grains strike wet cobble and bite in; the ring takes. The courier flinches as if the salt stung his ankles through leather. When he tries to shift his foot back, it drags—like the sole is briefly tacky to the stone. He can still move, but not quickly, and not without making it obvious.

“Don’t—” he starts.

“Kneel,” Halven growls, voice low and dangerous in the dim.

The courier obeys, slow. He lowers one knee, then the other, hands held away from his belt. He turns his hip so the seal faces you. In the near-dark you can see the wax clearly: funerary gold with a thumbprint impressed deep, and now that thin seam running from the edge toward the center like a cracked lip. The seam *breathes* once—tightens—then stills again, starved by the smothered lantern.

Your words to the mist land like a hook.

The pale column at the ward-line compresses, letterforms in it shuddering into alignment despite the hush-ring’s pressure. Its “voice” comes through in broken fragments, forced and wet:

“HALVEN… ROOK… WROTE—” it rasps, then the sound tears, as if the hush-ring is shredding the sentence. The mist recoils a handspan, then surges back to the ward-line and tries again, more desperate.

“NOT ROOK. NOT ROOK. THREAD-SCRIBE. STITCHED-MOUTH.”

As it says *stitched-mouth*, a line of script appears across the mist like a pulled seam—briefly forming the image you saw in the puddle: vellum-face, mouth sewn shut with hair-thin writing. The mist’s attention is fixed between you and the seal now, hunting a “line” to follow.

Threat, clear and immediate: if Halven reopens the lantern too soon, the invitation seal is likely to open further—and whatever is bound to that funerary gold will have enough purchase to draw the epitaph-spirit’s reach around your hush-ring via the courier, turning the city-side threshold into a contested space.

#### Turn 32 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my body between the courier and the ward-line and hiss to Halven, “Keep it smothered—no heroics. If we need light, give me a sliver through your fingers, not a full breath.”

I lean in close to the courier’s belt without touching it, and slide a thin strip of warded paper from my satchel to hover like a shield between the seal and open air. “Courier—tell me exactly what the thumbprint is. Whose thumb. Whose funeral.”

Then, to the mist, I press two salt-gritty fingers to the hush-ring and speak carefully: “Thread-Scribe, stitched-mouth—give me a name I can write. One true name, and I’ll set an epitaph on clean paper and push it under the gate for you to eat. Refuse, and you get only silence and salt.”

*Agent reasoning: The seal reacts to light and the spirit is trying to follow a “thread”; I want to keep the lantern smothered, interrogate the mist for the Thread-Scribe identity, and physically/ritually contain the seal before it opens.*

#### Turn 33 **[GAME]**

Halven answers with action, not reassurance. He keeps the lantern shuttered and cups his free hand over the seams, leaving only a thin, accidental bleed of emberlight between two knuckles—barely enough to give edges to things. The wrapped sheet stays pinned to the lantern’s cold backplate, his forearm locked like a brace.

You slide a narrow strip of warded paper from your satchel and hold it between the seal and the open air. The paper doesn’t flare or smoke; instead, the seam in the funerary-gold wax stops its subtle “breathing” entirely, as if the warded strip has flattened the seal’s appetite. The courier’s belt stops twitching.

The courier swallows hard, eyes flicking from your fingers to the salt circle at his knees. “Thumbprint’s… not mine.” His voice drops. “It’s the Master of Wakes’ mark. Grave-Gild. The one who signs the quiet-bills.” He hesitates, then forces it out. “Funeral was—officially—Brother Caldris.” He looks up at Halven like expecting a strike. “Monastery man. Died on paper. Didn’t die in the ground.”

At the ward-line, the mist recoils as your salt-gritty fingers press into the hush-ring. The sigil holds, but it strains: the crescent of grave-salt dulls from gray to a wet, used dark where your touch anchors it.

When you offer the trade—name for epitaph—the mist compresses into something almost human-shaped. Script crawls along its surface, trying to assemble a single line that can survive the hush.

It manages three words, each one a wet tear:

“CALDRIS—” (the sound sticks, like it’s swallowing a pin)
“WROTE—”
“ME.”

Then it spasms, and the “face” in it flashes again: vellum skin, mouth stitched shut, the stitches moving like living cursive.

A new sound joins the scraping behind it: a soft, rapid *tap-tap-tap* from deeper in the necropolis corridors, like fingernails on stone—coming closer, triangulating the gate by your lantern’s buried ember.

Threat, explicit: something else is approaching from inside the necropolis—faster than the mist—drawn by the same keyed attention (your monastery-name, the seal, or the lamp). If it reaches the ward-line while the seal is still cracked, it may use the courier as a handle to pull on the city side.

#### Turn 34 **[PLAYER]**

I jerk my chin at Halven. “Back us up—three steps, slow. Keep the lantern smothered and the wrapped sheet cold; don’t give that tapping a bead to follow.”

I tug my satchel open and, without breaking the warded-paper “shield,” scribble fast on a fresh slip: **CALDRIS WROTE ME; I AM HIS STITCHED MOUTH; I REST WHERE INK CANNOT BREATHE.** Then I fold it tight into a small epitaph packet, salt its crease, and slide it under the gate’s lowest gap with two fingers. “There—eat that. Stay at the line and leave my name alone.”

To the courier, still kneeling: “Unbuckle the belt—slowly—and set it on the ground inside your salt circle. Then lace your fingers behind your head. If that seal cracks again, I’ll drown it in salt and you with it.”

*Agent reasoning: The approaching tapping means we’re about to be flanked by something worse; I need to stabilize the seal and buy time by feeding the mist an epitaph, while also shifting us away from the gate’s “line.” I’m curious about Caldris and Thread-Scribe, but survival first—then questions.*

#### Turn 35 **[GAME]**



#### Turn 36 **[PLAYER]**

I signal Halven to back up three slow steps with the lantern still smothered, the wrapped sheet kept pinned cold against the backplate. Without dropping my warded-paper “shield,” I scribble an epitaph slip—“CALDRIS WROTE ME; I AM HIS STITCHED MOUTH; I REST WHERE INK CANNOT BREATHE.”—fold it tight, salt the crease, and slide it under the gate.  

Then I keep my eyes on the courier’s belt and order, “Unbuckle it slowly and set it on the ground inside the salt ring—hands nowhere near the wax—then lace your fingers behind your head.”

*Agent reasoning: The threat’s escalating with that tapping; I want to reduce light/attention, feed the mist an epitaph to distract it, and secure the cracked seal by isolating it from the courier’s body.*

#### Turn 37 **[GAME]**

Halven follows your chin-jerk immediately. Three slow steps back, heel-to-toe, keeping the lantern’s shutter clenched and his palm cupped over its seams. The ember-bleed between his fingers thins further until it’s barely a bruise on the metal. The cloth-wrapped sheet stays pinned to the lantern’s backplate; you can hear the faintest tick as it cools against the brass.

You keep the warded-paper strip hovering in front of the courier’s belt like a flat, pale blade. With your other hand you scribble the epitaph fast—ink biting cleanly into the slip—fold it tight, salt the crease. When you slide it under the gate’s lowest gap, the paper catches for a heartbeat on rough iron… then slips through.

Inside the necropolis, the mist at the ward-line lunges—not across, but *down* toward the gap. It compresses, then pours itself along the stone like spilled breath. The folded packet vanishes into it.

A sound like dry lips smacking follows. Then the mist swells, as if swallowing. The stitched-face flickers once, clearer than before—vellum skin, the mouth-seam tugging—then the whole column *thins* and pulls back from the ward-line by a handspan. The pressure against your hush-ring eases. It doesn’t leave, but it stops straining forward.

Your warning—*leave my name alone*—gets an answer, scraped and small from the retreating fog:

“NO NAME. ONLY LINE.”

The tapping from deeper inside changes: it pauses, then resumes closer, now with a second rhythm under it—like something dragging a chain or a pen-case on stone.

The courier obeys your order, trembling. “Slow. Slow—” he whispers to himself. He keeps his hands high and away from the wax as if it’s hot. With two fingers he hooks the belt buckle and works it loose in tiny increments.

As the belt slackens, the funerary-gold seal gives a faint *creak*—not cracking, but flexing, like wax warming near a hearth. The hairline seam you’d stopped tries to reopen.

Your warded-paper “shield” catches it: the seam halts mid-flex, held in check, but you can tell it *wants* air.

He sets the belt down inside the salt circle, careful as placing a sleeping snake. Then he interlaces his fingers behind his head and freezes, eyes wide.

Threat, immediate and concrete: something on the necropolis side is now within a few paces of the gate—close enough that the tapping is loud and directional. If the lantern opens or the belt-seal gets exposed to open air again, whatever’s approaching may use that as a target to strike through the ward-line, and the courier’s belt on the ground is now the most obvious “handle.”

#### Turn 38 **[PLAYER]**

I flick more grave-salt to thicken the courier’s ring, then drag a second, narrower salt circle around the belt itself, sealing it off like a little island. “Halven—keep that lantern choked. If it twitches, tell me before it does.”

I hook the edge of my warded-paper under the belt strap (never touching wax) and inch-drag the belt a half-step farther from the gate, then slap a second ward-slip over the buckle like a bandage. 

Toward the necropolis, I lower my voice. “Tapper with the chain—are you the one that stitched Caldris, or are you hunting his line? Show me what you are without crossing, and I’ll answer in ink, not flame.”

*Agent reasoning: The seal is a dangerous handle and something is close; I want to secure the belt and learn what’s approaching without giving it light. I’ll reinforce wards, move the belt away from the gate, and try to “listen”/parley with the tapper while keeping Halven dark.*

#### Turn 40 **[PLAYER]**

I flick more grave-salt to thicken the ring around the courier, then draw a second tight salt circle around the belt itself like a little island. “Halven—keep that lantern choked; if it so much as twitches, warn me.”

Keeping my fingers off the wax, I hook my warded-paper under the belt strap and inch-drag it a half-step farther from the gate, then press a fresh ward-slip over the buckle like a bandage. Toward the necropolis, I call softly, “Tapper with the chain—did you stitch Caldris, or are you hunting his line? Show yourself without crossing, and I’ll answer in ink, not flame.”

*Agent reasoning: The tapper is close and the belt-seal is a tempting handle; I want to secure it with extra salt and wards, keep Halven’s lantern fully smothered, and try to coax information from whatever’s approaching without letting it cross.*

Without touching the wax, I hook my warded-paper under the belt strap and inch-drag it a half-step farther from the gate, then press a fresh ward-slip over the buckle. Toward the tapping, I murmur, “Chain-tapper—did you stitch Caldris, or are you hunting his line? Show yourself without crossing, and I’ll answer in ink, not flame.”

*Agent reasoning: The gate-side threat is close; I want to reduce “handles” it can grab (the belt/seal) and learn what’s approaching without giving it light. Salt/wards buy time, then I try to parley to identify it.*

#### Turn 43 **[GAME]**

The grave-salt bites the wet stone with a crisp, pale edge. The courier’s ring thickens into a chalky berm; his boots stop trembling once he realizes the line is *there*. The second, tighter circle around the belt takes—salt grains skitter, then settle as if tugged into place by an unseen seam. For a moment, the funerary-gold wax quiets, its hairline flex arrested.

Halven keeps his lantern choked, shoulders rigid. He doesn’t answer your warning with words—just a sharp nod, eyes fixed on the shutter like he’s listening for a heartbeat inside it.

You slide the warded sheet under the belt strap. The leather drags with a damp squeal. As you inch it a half-step farther from the gate, the air *catches*—a brief suction toward the necropolis side, like the ward-line noticing something moved. The belt crosses your new salt “island” boundary by a finger’s width… and the wax responds immediately: the seal creaks and lifts a fraction, as if trying to inhale.

When you slap the fresh ward-slip over the buckle, the paper adheres with a soft, papery *click*. The wax’s flex stops mid-rise. A thin line of heat crawls across the ward-slip—ink on the paper darkens along a single stroke, writing itself into a tiny, involuntary dash, then going still.

From the necropolis side, the tapping halts.

A chain scrapes once, slow and deliberate, and a shape resolves just beyond the ward-line: not a full figure, but an arrangement of parts the mist is willing to outline. A hand first—bone-white, ink-stained fingertips—holding a length of fine chain with a brass nib tied to it like a pendulum. Behind it, a hooded head is suggested by drifting moth-ash; where a face should be, there’s only layered paper, edges fluttering.

It does not cross. It leans close enough that the ward-line bows inward like glass under pressure.

The thing answers your question by *demonstration*: the brass nib on the chain taps the stone—once, twice—and each tap leaves a brief, wet-black mark that immediately tries to become a letter. The ward-line rejects the writing; the marks smear into illegible hooks and evaporate.

A voice follows, dry as a page turned too fast. “CALDRIS IS A MARGIN. I DO NOT STITCH MARGINS.”

The chain lifts. The nib points—not at you, but at the belt inside the salt island.

“HIS LINE HIDES IN GOLD. LET ME READ IT.”

Behind you, the courier chokes on a sound and goes very still, as if afraid even breath will count as permission.

#### Turn 44 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my warded-paper shield between the gate and the belt and shake my head once. “No. You don’t get to *read* through my circles.”

I tilt my reliquary lamp a hair toward the ward-slip on the buckle—still shuttered—and speak to the paper-faced thing. “Name yourself, Reader. What do you call a ‘margin,’ and what happens when you find one?” Then, to the courier without looking back: “Don’t move. Halven—if the lantern pulses, say so.”

I pinch a fresh slip, wet the tip with my tongue, and sketch a quick decoy sigil—just enough gold-shape mimicry in ink—then hold it up at the ward-line. “You can read this instead. Tell me what you see in it, and we’ll talk about the real gold.”

*Agent reasoning: The chain-nib thing might be a reader rather than an attacker, but it’s fixating on the belt-seal—dangerous. I want more information and a controlled test without giving it access or permission, and I also want to interrogate it about “margin” and Caldris while keeping Halven and the courier steady.*

I angle my shuttered reliquary lamp slightly toward the ward-slip on the buckle. “Name yourself, Reader. When you say ‘margin,’ what are you calling Caldris—someone spared, someone excluded, or a note that won’t stay put? And what do you *do* when you find one?”

Over my shoulder, low and firm: “Courier, don’t move. Halven—if the lantern even pulses, say it.”

I wet a fresh slip, sketch a quick decoy sigil with a faint gold-shape mimic, and hold it just shy of the ward-line. “Read this instead. Tell me what you see in *this* ink, and then we’ll discuss the real gold.”

*Agent reasoning: The Reader wants access to the belt’s gold seal; I’ll probe its identity and motives while offering a decoy to learn how it “reads,” and keep everyone still in case the lantern reacts.*

#### Turn 51 **[GAME]**

Your decoy slip catches the necropolis air and stiffens as the warding circles drink the spit-wet ink. The faint gold-shape mimic you sketched doesn’t glow—at first. Then it *sheens* like funeral gilt under candlelight, a convincing lie.

Between the gate stones, the puddled shadow you’d called “Reader” gathers itself into a face again: vellum-pale, mouth stitched shut with thread-thin script. The stitches twitch as if trying to pronounce your question anyway.

It doesn’t speak aloud.

Instead, the ward-line on the gate answers for it—thin, black lettering crawling along the seam where stone meets iron:

**MARGIN: WHAT IS LEFT WHEN THE PAGE IS CUT.  
CALDRIS: A NAME REMOVED TO FIT THE BINDING.**

As the text finishes, your decoy sigil *pulls*—not toward the gate, but toward the stitched face, like a hook catching cloth. The paper in your hand tugs forward half an inch. The “Reader” leans, and the stitched script across its mouth loosens by one thread, a single filament lifting into the air like a feeler.

Halven Rook’s voice snaps tight behind you. “Lamp’s steady—no pulse.”

The courier obeys your order in the worst way: he goes perfectly still, but his gloved hand slowly opens, letting the gold-sealed invitation slip from his fingers. It lands near the ward-line with a soft *tck*—and the funerary wax thumbprint flashes, briefly wet-looking, as if freshly pressed.

The ward-line reacts to the gold mimicry on your decoy. A hairline crack of light runs along the buckle’s ward-slip—your own belt ward answering the gate’s ward like two notes finding harmony. The “Reader” takes advantage of the resonance: that lifted stitch-thread darts toward your decoy slip, aiming to *sew* itself into your drawn sigil.

Threat, clear and immediate: if that thread anchors, it will “read” through your decoy—then use the resonance to bridge into the warding on your person.

The crawling gate-text adds one more line, faster, less controlled:

**WHEN I FIND A MARGIN, I RESTORE THE MISSING LINE.**

#### Turn 52 **[PLAYER]**

I snap the decoy slip down and tear it clean in half, then crumple both pieces into a tight ball and shove them into my satchel’s warded pocket. “No anchor for you.”

With my boot, I scuff a rough line through the belt’s outer salt circle to break the harmony, then nudge the dropped invitation farther away from the ward-line with the edge of my warded paper—careful not to touch the wax. “Courier—hands up where I can see them. Halven, keep watching that lamp.”

I lean toward the gate and speak softly, almost conversational. “Restore the missing line how—by writing Caldris back into the world, or by erasing whoever holds his place? And what binding cut his name in the first place?”

*Agent reasoning: That stitch-thread is trying to anchor to my decoy and bridge into my own wards—cut the connection fast, break the “gold” resonance, and gather more info without letting it read me.*

#### Turn 53 **[GAME]**

You tear the decoy slip before the lifted stitch-thread can bite. The filament snaps back mid-lunge and whips the air with a dry, papery *flick*. For a heartbeat the torn halves *try* to pull toward each other—then your satchel’s warded pocket swallows them and the tugging stops. The “Reader” recoils as if you’d slapped its hand.

Your boot scuffs through the outer salt circle on the belt. The hairline light along the ward-slip gutters and dies. Whatever harmony was building between gate-ward and buckle-ward breaks cleanly.

When you nudge the gold-sealed invitation away with the edge of your warded sheet, the wax thumbprint doesn’t smear—but it *warms*. A faint scent of melted beeswax and grave-rose rises, and the paper under the seal curls slightly as if it’s been near flame.

“Hands—up,” you order.

The courier’s hands rise, palms out. His sleeves fall back enough to show mourning-thread tattoos at the wrists: neat tally marks, some crossed through. He doesn’t speak, but his eyes track the invitation like it’s a loaded spring.

Halven keeps his gaze on your lamp and the gate seam. “Still steady,” he says. Then, lower: “But the ward-line’s rewriting.”

Because it is. Your soft questions don’t get spoken answers; they get *edits*.

The stitched face leans closer to the gate seam, and the black crawling text there rearranges itself, letters scuttling like beetles:

**RESTORE: RETURN THE CUT NAME TO ITS ORIGINAL PLACE.  
THE PLACE IS OCCUPIED.  
BINDING: CONCORD LAMPSKIN. WICK-OIL. VOW-THREAD.**

As that last line forms, the reliquary lamp in your hand doesn’t pulse—but its shutter seams sweat a thin line of warm oil-scent, unmistakably the Concord’s recipe. The “Reader” reacts immediately: the stitches over its mouth tighten, then one stitch unhooks itself and drops—an actual loop of script-thread falling from nothing to the wet stone.

It lands between you and the gate and begins to *crawl* toward your boot, seeking a new anchor now that the paper is denied.

Threat: if that living stitch-thread touches your person or your lamp, it can fasten and “restore” by force—using you as the margin to write through.

The courier, hands still raised, finally speaks in a thin voice: “Lot Thirteen is… Atlas-leaf by candlelight. They’ll pay to see that lamp sweat.”

#### Turn 54 **[PLAYER]**

I hop my boot back and drop to a knee, pinning the crawling stitch-thread to the wet stone with the edge of my warded-paper like a bookknife. “Halven—steady on the lamp. Courier—Lot Thirteen: who *exactly* are they buying for?”

Without lifting the paper, I uncap my ink and blot a tight “closed eye” ward right over the thread, then slide the whole pinned mess into an empty glass vial from my satchel and cork it fast. I glance at the gate seam. “If the place is occupied, tell me the occupant’s name—unless you’ve cut that too.”

*Agent reasoning: The crawling stitch-thread is the immediate danger; I need to stop it without letting it anchor to me or the lamp. I also want to exploit what it revealed—Concord lampskin/vow-thread—and press the courier about Lot Thirteen while keeping Halven watching the lamp.*

#### Turn 55 **[GAME]**

You hop back in time. The stitch-thread lunges for where your boot *was* and hits only wet stone, skittering sideways in a frustrated curl.

Dropping to a knee, you bring the warded-paper down like a bookknife. The edge catches the thread hard enough to make a tiny squeal—more felt in your teeth than heard. It tries to flatten, to slip out from under the paper, but your weight and the warding hold it in place.

Halven’s reply is immediate, controlled. “Lamp steady. No pulse.” He shifts his stance, putting himself between you and the open path behind—watching both the gate seam and the courier.

The courier swallows, hands still up. “Buying for… a table, not a person. Grave-Gild calls it the **Ashen Bench**. Three seats. One’s always empty.” His eyes flick to the invitation you shoved away. “They don’t bid—people bid *to be seen by them*.”

You uncap your ink. The moment the nib nears the pinned stitch-thread, the thread thrashes, trying to jerk free—like a worm sensing salt. Your “closed eye” ward lands cleanly over it anyway: a tight oval with a barbed lid-line. The ward drinks the motion. The thread goes slack, then stiff, as if it’s suddenly forgotten how to be a sentence.

Sliding the pinned mess into a vial is awkward but it works: you tilt the paper, guide the immobilized thread inside, and cork it fast. The vial gives a single, sharp *tick* from within—then silence. The glass fogs for a second with a breathy film of tiny letters that immediately smear into nothing.

At the gate seam, your question about the occupant makes the crawling text hesitate—then *scribble over itself* in a messy correction. New words force their way through:

**OCCUPANT: ELDRA QUILLWHISPER.**

The letters deepen, as if pressed with a heavier hand. Then an addendum appears, smaller, meaner:

**(UNFINISHED.)**

Consequence hits right after: your reliquary lamp’s shutter seams ooze one slow tear of warm wick-oil down the side—more than scent this time, a visible bead. The bead doesn’t fall; it *clings*, trembling, as if waiting for permission.

Halven’s voice tightens. “Moth. That’s… not how wards label people.”

The gate’s ward-line continues to rewrite, and the iron at its edge gives a faint, stressed creak—as if something on the other side has noticed the name it’s being offered.

I swipe my thumb across the lamp’s oily bead and smear it onto a blank ward-slip, then fold the slip shut twice and tuck it into my satchel—out of the gate’s sight. “No consent.”

I step in close enough to glare at the crawling seam-text and draw a quick correction mark in the air with my inked finger—an editor’s hook. “False colophon. If you want a name, use mine properly: Eldra ‘Moth’ Quillwhisper, lantern-scribe—*not* your occupant.”  

Then I glance sharply at the courier. “Ashen Bench—who sits the other two seats, and what does the empty one *want*?”

*Agent reasoning: The gate just tried to name me as the “occupant,” which feels like a binding trick; I want to interrupt the inscription, learn what “unfinished” means, and keep the lamp from being used as a key while also squeezing the courier for details on the Ashen Bench.*

*Agent reasoning: There’s no new scene text, so I’ll reassert my last intent in-character: deny the gate any offering, challenge the false “occupant” label, and interrogate the courier about the Ashen Bench’s members and motives—key mystery threads.*

#### Turn 63 **[GAME]**

The folded ward-slip drinks the lamp’s oily bead the way blotter takes a secret. Your thumb-ward bites shut with a dry little sting—heatless, but certain. The lamp’s flame doesn’t change, yet the air around your satchel stops “tasting” like wick-oil for a breath, as if you’ve put a lid on a scent.

At the seam of Larkspur Gate, your editor’s hook hangs in the air like a punctuation mark that refuses to fall. The seam-text—thin, hairline script packed into the stone’s join—shivers and tries to reflow around it.

Then it *gives*.

A strip of writing peels up from the seam as if lifted by an invisible knife. Beneath the false colophon, a truer line shows through—older, pressed deep into the granite:

**“CATALOGUE OF OCCUPANTS: [VACANT]”**

The bracketed word isn’t ink. It’s an absence shaped like a word, a place where a name has been scraped out so thoroughly the stone looks *starved*. As you stare, the absence tugs at the back of your throat, trying to make you cough up a syllable you don’t mean to give. The seam answers your demand by *inviting you to fill it*.

Behind you, the Grave-Gild courier flinches as the strip of seam-text lifts. He takes a half-step back, palm raised—an undertaker’s reflex when a corpse sits up. His gold-sealed invitation crinkles in his fist.

“Ashen Bench,” he says quickly, voice low. “Two seats are spoken for: **Warden-Scribe Halven Rook**… and **Acolyte Senn**. Concord eyes. They’re coming to make it look lawful.”

He swallows, gaze flicking to your satchel like he can smell the ward-slip you just buried. “The empty seat—” His mouth works as if the word hurts. “—belongs to **the one the Concord expunged**. Not a person on paper anymore. It wants a name *put back where it was cut out*. It wants a hand to write it—yours, if you’re stupid enough.”

As he says that, the seam’s lifted strip trembles and begins to curl toward your inked finger, seeking contact like a hungry bookmark.

#### Turn 64 **[PLAYER]**

I jerk my inked finger back and slap a clean ward-slip between my hand and the curling strip, whispering, “No autographs,” as I press it flat to pin the hungry text against the stone.  

Without looking away from the [VACANT], I ask Halven under my breath, “Warden-Scribe—since when are you ‘spoken for’ by Grave-Gild, and who is Acolyte Senn to you?”  

Then, to the courier: “The Concord expunged *which* name—tell me what you remember: first letter, cadence, anything. And what happens if the vacancy stays vacant?”

*Agent reasoning: The seam is trying to trick me into supplying a name; I want to learn about the expunged one without feeding it, and I’m curious why Halven’s name is on that bench. I should physically block the “bookmark” strip, contain it if possible, and interrogate both Halven and the courier for details.*

#### Turn 65 **[GAME]**

Your clean ward-slip hits the curling strip with a papery *thwack*. The lifted seam-text spasms like a hooked fish—then pins flat, trapped under the ward. The stone beneath frosts over in a thin rime where the slip touches, and the strip’s frantic curling slows to a resentful tremble.

But the bracketed absence—**[VACANT]**—doesn’t pin. It *stares back* as a hole in the sentence. Your throat tightens again, testing whether you’ll volunteer a syllable.

Halven Rook is already there—close enough that his breath fogs faintly in the cold seep off the gate. He doesn’t look at the courier; he looks at your satchel and the ward-slip you just spent.

“Spoken for?” he murmurs, and the words are careful, clipped. “I’m not bought. I’m **assigned**. Grave-Gild requested a ‘neutral witness’ for their Vigil-Auction and the Concord agreed—because the alternative is a riot of lamps and forged leaves.” His gaze flicks to the pinned strip. “You’re making that alternative.”

“And Senn,” he says, quieter still, “is my acolyte. My runner. My liability.”

The courier’s eyes keep darting to the **[VACANT]** like it might climb out. He wets his lips, then forces the memory out as if it’s lodged behind his teeth.

“First letter… I remember the *shape* more than the sound,” he whispers. “A tall hook. Like an **L**—or an old **I** with a thorn. The cadence was… three beats. Soft-hard-soft. Like a name you could sing and regret.”

He flinches, suddenly, because the pinned strip *scratches* under your ward-slip—tiny, rapid strokes. Not words. Practice. Like something learning your pressure.

“If it stays vacant,” the courier says, voice thinning, “the vacancy doesn’t stay still. It starts borrowing. It takes names off stones, off ledgers, off throats. People forget who they are supposed to mourn, and the dead get… impatient.”

As he speaks, the seam around **[VACANT]** subtly widens—no more than a hair—but enough that the gate’s join sighs, and a faint, papery rasp leaks out from within, like pages being turned by someone with no hands.

I tilt my lamp toward the **[VACANT]** without offering oil. “Halven—what exactly did the Concord expunge, and with what rite? Do you carry the redaction order on you?”  

Then I look to the courier. “Three beats, thorned L/I—was it a title, a person, or a place? And who benefits if it starts borrowing names—Grave-Gild or Concord?”

Keeping my mouth shut on any proper nouns, I press the ward-slip to the boundary and drag it a finger’s width along the perimeter, watching for snagging, heat, frost, or ink-bleed. “And if either of you has a written order, seal, or scrap with that thorned L/I—hand it over. No summaries.”

*Agent reasoning: I don’t have any scene text to respond to, so I’ll probe the environment and the NPCs directly while staying careful not to “name” the vacancy; I’ll also try a small, safe test to see how the absence behaves at an edge.*

I keep the lamp’s light grazing the stone and never center it on the **[VACANT]**. “Halven, courier—say *exactly* what your eyes report, not what you think it means. Start with the edge: is it jagged, soft, smoking, bright, cold?”  

I slide the ward-slip clockwise along the boundary, pausing every handspan to tap the stone and sniff for salt, iron, or ozone; if the slip snags or the ink twitches, I stop and mark that spot with a tiny dot. “And if you’ve got a redaction order or any sealed scrap with that thorned L/I, put it on the ground between us—slowly—so I can read the seal before the vacancy gets hungry.”

*Agent reasoning: The scene didn’t render any details, so I’ll probe the environment and force NPCs to describe what’s happening while continuing my careful, non-naming measurements around the absence; also I’ll try to bait out any physical document they might have.*

#### Turn 85 **[GAME]**

Your lamp makes a careful orbit, light kept to the *stone that still admits light*. The **[VACANT]** refuses the glow the way a hole refuses rain—no shine, no shadow, just a stubborn non-return.

Halven Rook swallows once, then forces his gaze to the edge you indicate. “Edge… looks… *stitched*,” he says, each word clipped as if he’s reading a confiscation list. “Not thread—like the *idea* of thread. Little bites. Saw-tooth but… soft. Cold. My eyes keep trying to slide off it.”

The courier—Grave-Gild coat, funerary-gold pin—keeps his hands visible and his voice low. “I see a clean oval of—” he stops, blinks hard, and corrects himself as if physically yanked. “I see the *stone stop*. Like wax ends at a mold line. It’s brighter right *next* to it, like the lamp’s trying to fill it and can’t.”

“At the decoy glyph,” Halven continues, “it—” he pauses, jaw working. “It *tasted* it. The edge leaned. The lampsmoke—your wick—pulled sideways for a breath. Then it… rejected it. Like spitting out a hair. After that, the boundary got tighter. Less… fray.”

You press the ward-slip to the perimeter and drag it clockwise.

At the first handspan: nothing—paper skates over damp stone.

Second: a faint *snag*, like the slip caught on an invisible burr. The ink on your warding twitch-lines crawls a hair’s breadth toward the **[VACANT]** and then freezes. When you tap the stone there, it answers with a slightly higher, hollower note. The air smells briefly of ozone and old iron—like a struck nail.

You dot the spot.

Third pause: the slip warms, not the stone—your fingers feel heat *through the paper* as if the warding is doing work. A thin line of salt—gritty, deliberate—runs under moss, circling part of the boundary. Not natural seep: poured and brushed.

When you ask for orders or scraps, Halven’s gloved hand goes to his satchel and stops, knuckles whitening. “I have a seal,” he says, and doesn’t move it yet. The courier obeys first: he kneels and sets a small folded document on the ground between you, waxed shut with funerary gold.

The wax bears the thorned L/I—pressed hard enough to crack the gold. As it touches the stone, the **[VACANT]**’s edge subtly *leans* toward it, like a mouth remembering it can open.

#### Turn 86 **[PLAYER]**

I suck in a careful breath and hook the ward-slip under the courier’s sealed document, sliding it a foot back *away* from the **[VACANT]** without touching the wax. “Good. No closer than that—if it leans again, we move it farther.”

I angle the lamp so its light stays on the salt line and the snagged spot, not the hole. “Halven, why won’t you put your seal down? Tell me what the thorned L/I *means*, not what you’ve been told to call it.” I glance to the courier. “And you—who issued this, and what happens if I break it?”

Still crouched, I tap the hollower note again and press the warmed ward-slip briefly to the salt under the moss. “This salt circle—yours, Halven? Or theirs? And what’s anchored at my dotted snag—iron, nail, hinge, or a name someone tried to nail in place?”

*Agent reasoning: The vacancy reacts to the seal like bait; I want to keep it from feeding while learning what the seal is and why Halven hesitates. I’ll ward the document first, then interrogate both about the thorned L/I and the salt circle, and probe that snag point safely.*

I hook my ward-slip under the sealed document and slide it another two feet away from the **[VACANT]**, watching the edge for any “lean,” then pin the paper down with a small stone. “No one touches the wax yet.”

I keep the lamp trained on the salt under the moss and the dotted snag. “Courier: who issued this order, and what’s the consequence if the seal breaks—curse, summons, or simply notification?” I turn to Halven. “And you—why are you hesitating? Tell me what the thorned L/I *actually* signifies, not the polite name.”

I tap the hollow spot once more, then scrape moss aside with the corner of the ward-slip to expose the salt line. “Whose salt is this, and what’s anchored under my dot—ironwork, a nail, or a written name?”

*Agent reasoning: The seal made the edge “lean,” so I should get it farther from the VACANT and interrogate both men for specifics; the salt line and hollow tap suggest an anchor point worth probing without naming the absence.*

#### Turn 89 **[GAME]**

You slide the sealed document another two feet back. The **[VACANT]** edge *does* lean—just a finger’s-width of motion in the wrong direction, like fabric tugged by a draft—then it stops when the wax crosses an unseen threshold. The air pressure eases. Pinning it with a stone makes the gold wax give a tiny, brittle *tick*… but it doesn’t crack further.

The courier watches the edge, throat bobbing. “Issued by a Grave-Gild notary,” he says, careful as if each syllable is a coin. “Not a street undertaker. A *Vigil* notary—auction-side.” He points but doesn’t approach. “If the seal breaks, it’s not a curse. It’s a *notice*. The wax remembers the first eyes that open it. The notary gets that memory. So does anyone… listening through their ink.”

Halven’s hand stays half in his satchel. He doesn’t look at the document now; he looks at your lamp, then at the salt. “Because mine isn’t funerary gold,” he says. “It’s Concord blackwax. It doesn’t just notify— it *binds*. And this thing—” he flicks two fingers toward the **[VACANT]** without fully pointing, as if afraid to give it a straight line— “is hungry for bindings.”

You scrape moss aside along your dotted segment. The salt line beneath is not a full circle—more like a *stitched arc*, brushed in short, repeated strokes. Mixed in it are tiny dark grains that glitter when the lamp catches them.

Halven exhales through his nose. “Concord salt, cut with lamp-ash. A ward-line. Old.”

Your second tap on the hollower note answers differently now: not just hollow, but *metallic*, as if you struck a thin lid. You press the warmed ward-slip to the exposed salt—its ink shivers, then steadies, as though the warding recognizes the mixture.

At your dotted snag, the stone gives a faint, reluctant *give*. Not collapse—more like a cover shifting a hair. Something small is anchored there, close to the surface.

The courier crouches, squinting. “That’s not a name,” he murmurs. “Names don’t ring.”

Halven finally says what he’s been avoiding. “The thorned L/I isn’t ‘Lot’ or ‘Ledger.’ It’s **Lacuna Imprimatur**—a redaction authority. Permission to make a hole where a record used to be.” He swallows. “And if this is Concord salt… then someone tried to *pin* the lacuna in place with iron.”

As he says “iron,” the lamp’s smoke pulls sideways again—toward your dotted spot—like it’s being breathed in.

#### Turn 90 **[PLAYER]**

I pinch the lamp-wick down until the smoke thins, then shift the lamp so it lights my hands and the salt-arc, not the **[VACANT]**. “No more saying ‘iron’ out loud,” I mutter, then to Halven: “Lacuna Imprimatur—who can grant it, and what’s the price? Don’t give me titles—give me mechanics.”

Keeping my eyes on the stone, I slide two ward-slips under the slightly-giving spot like shims and use my knife-tip to lift the “lid” a hair at a time, listening for that ring. To the courier, quiet: “If the notary gets the first-eye memory, can I blind the memory—smoke, mirror-sheen, or a surrogate gaze from my lamp?”

*Agent reasoning: The metallic “lid” and smoke-draft suggest a physical anchor that’s interacting with the warding; I want to expose it carefully without feeding the VACANT, and I also want to learn more about Lacuna Imprimatur and the notary’s notice.*

#### Turn 91 **[GAME]**



#### Turn 92 **[PLAYER]**

I pinch the lamp-wick down until the smoke thins, angling the light to my hands and the exposed salt-arc, never the **[VACANT]**. “Halven—Lacuna Imprimatur: who can grant it, and what’s the *mechanical* price? What gets paid, what gets taken, what gets bound?”  

Without looking up, I slide two ward-slips under the slightly-giving spot like shims and ease my knife-tip under the edge, lifting the “lid” a hair at a time and pausing whenever it rings. To the courier, very quiet: “That seal takes the first-eye memory—can I blind it with smoke or mirror-sheen, or give it a surrogate gaze through my lamp?”

*Agent reasoning: The “lid” and the warded salt arc feel like a trap-anchor; I want to learn the rules of the Lacuna Imprimatur and safely reveal what’s under the dotted snag without feeding the VACANT. Also, the courier’s seal “remembers first eyes,” so I should ask how to obscure or redirect that memory before opening anything.*

#### Turn 93 **[GAME]**



#### Turn 94 **[PLAYER]**

I pinch the wick down until the smoke thins and keep the lamp’s light on my hands and the exposed salt-arc—never centered on the **[VACANT]**. “Halven—Lacuna Imprimatur: who can grant it, and what’s the *mechanical* price? What gets paid, what gets taken, what gets bound?”

Without looking up, I shim two ward-slips under the slightly-giving spot and ease my knife-tip under the edge, lifting the “lid” a hair at a time and pausing whenever it rings. To the courier, barely a whisper: “That seal steals the first-eye memory—can I blind it with smoke or mirror-sheen, or feed it a surrogate gaze through my lamp instead?”

*Agent reasoning: I need answers about the Lacuna Imprimatur and the seal’s “first-eye” trick, but the anchored lid is an immediate physical clue—so I’ll keep prying carefully while pressing both NPCs for concrete mechanics and a workaround to open the document safely.*

#### Turn 95 **[GAME]**



#### Turn 96 **[PLAYER]**

I pinch the wick down until the smoke thins and keep the lamp’s light tight on my hands and the salt-arc, not the **[VACANT]**. “Halven—Lacuna Imprimatur: who can grant it, and what’s the mechanical price? What exactly gets paid, taken, or bound?”

I slide two ward-slips under the giving edge as shims and use my knife-tip to lift the “lid” a breath at a time, pausing whenever it rings. Without looking up, I whisper to the courier, “Can I blind the seal’s first-eye memory with smoke or a mirror-flash—or can my lamp ‘see’ for me and take the imprint instead?”

*Agent reasoning: The “lid” at the dotted snag is reacting like a hidden iron-capped anchor; I want to open it carefully while extracting details about Lacuna Imprimatur and how to spoof the seal’s “first-eye” memory without triggering the VACANT.*

#### Turn 97 **[GAME]**



#### Turn 98 **[PLAYER]**

I freeze with the knife mid-lift, listening for any change in the air, then murmur, “I’m not getting anything—did something just… skip?”  

I keep the lamp hooded and angled down, and press Halven again: “Mechanics. Who signs a Lacuna Imprimatur, and what does it *consume*—a name, a year, a witness, blood, debt?”  

Then I resume, lifting the lid a hair more with the ward-slips bracing it; with my other hand I tilt a sliver of polished lamp-metal to catch a faint reflection off the seal area—never directly looking—testing if the imprint can be routed into the lamp’s gaze instead of mine.

*Agent reasoning: The scene feed looks blank, so I’ll cautiously continue my careful prying while pressing Halven and the courier for concrete details, and I’ll test the “first-eye memory” idea with a small controlled reflection from my lamp without exposing the VACANT directly.*

#### Turn 99 **[GAME]**



#### Turn 100 **[PLAYER]**

I hold perfectly still, counting three breaths, then sweep the lamp low across the salt-arc to see if any grains have shifted. “Halven—did the Loom stutter, or did *we*?” I ask, and to the courier: “Say one true detail about what you see right now—anything.”

*Agent reasoning: The scene output is blank, so I’ll probe the environment carefully, verify if the “skip” is an in-world effect or missing narration, and keep my cautious, curious approach focused on the lid/seal and Halven/courier for answers.*

#### Turn 101 **[GAME]**

You hold the knife and don’t move. One breath. Two. Three.

On the third, the air *does* change—not a gust, not a sound. It’s the sensation of a page being turned in a room you can’t see. The hairs along your wrist lift, then settle.

You sweep the hooded lamp low along the salt-arc.

Most grains sit exactly where you laid them—except for a thumb-wide crescent near the “giving edge” of the lid. There, the salt has slumped inward as if something gently exhaled across it from *inside* the seam. A few crystals have gone dull and grey, like they’ve been licked clean of their sharpness.

Halven Rook doesn’t answer immediately. His boots shift on stone—one half-step back, careful not to cross your arc. When he speaks, his voice is quieter than before.

“We didn’t move,” he says. “The Loom did. A stitch was taken up somewhere nearby. That’s why it felt like a skip.”

He leans in just enough that his shadow touches the edge of your lamp-glow, but not the seam.

“Lacuna Imprimatur,” he continues, clipped and precise, like reciting a rule he hates. “Signed by a Concord Warden-Scribe with a full seal-ring and a witness who can still be written into the ledger afterward. The price is always the same kind of thing: *a piece of record.* Usually a day you lived. Sometimes a name you answer to. Sometimes a witness’s memory of you. It doesn’t spill blood— it drains trace. You come out… harder to cite.”

The courier flinches when you demand a true detail. He swallows, then blurts the first thing he can, eyes locked on the seam and your salt.

“Your lamp’s flame has two colors,” he says. “Gold at the core—violet at the edge. And the violet edge is bending toward the lid like it recognizes it.”

As he speaks, the seam answers: a thin, threadlike tick—*tick… tick*—not ringing metal, but script tapping bone. The lid rises a hair on its own against your shims, as if something inside has found the gap and is testing it from the other side.

The threat is clear now: whatever is sealed beneath has noticed your light and is actively working the opening.

#### Turn 102 **[PLAYER]**

I snap the lamp’s hood tighter and pinch the wick down until the violet edge thins, then turn the lamp so its metal back faces the seam—no direct gaze, no invitation. “Halven, talk me through a quick re-arc—what do we feed it: fresh salt, iron filings, ash?”

Without lifting my eyes, I slide the knife out, press the lid back down with the flat of my warded paper, and redraw the broken crescent with a dusting from my satchel—salt mixed with a pinch of soot. To the courier: “Don’t look at the seam. Hold your cloak up as a blind between the lamp and that gap—high and steady.”

*Agent reasoning: The lid is actively pushing and the salt is degrading; I need to stabilize the seal and cut the thing’s “interest” in my lamp’s violet edge. Also I want more intel, but safety first—re-arc the salt, dim/veil the lamp, and get Halven/courier to help without crossing the arc.*

#### Turn 103 **[GAME]**

You pinch the wick down and cinch the hood. The violet fringe of flame thins to a bruised ember, then tucks itself inward. When you rotate the lamp so its metal back faces the seam, the pressure in the air eases a fraction—like an ear turning away.

The *tick… tick* from inside stutters, then goes searching again.

You slide the knife out cleanly. Using the flat of your warded paper, you press the lid down. It resists for a heartbeat—something inside pushing up—then yields with a soft, reluctant *thunk* as the seal’s tension re-seats. Your warded sheet takes the contact without scorching; the ink on its margin crawls a millimeter sideways as if bracing.

Halven answers fast, voice tight. “Fresh salt to re-state the boundary. Ash to confuse appetite. Iron only if you want it to *hurt* what’s inside—iron makes them angry.”

You dust the broken crescent with salt and soot. The soot doesn’t scatter like powder should; it clings in a thin crescent-vein, darkening the arc as if the line has been re-inked. The dull grey crystals brighten back toward white.

The courier obeys—jerky, terrified. He snaps his cloak up between lamp and seam, arms shaking, making a high, uneven blind. “Like this—like this—”

For a moment, it works. The seam quiets. No ticking.

Then the cloak’s hem twitches as if tugged by a small hook. Not hard—testing. The courier gasps and instinctively tightens his grip, pulling the fabric taut.

A sound leaks out anyway, not through sight but through *word*: a single, muffled syllable presses against the underside of your hooded lamp, vibrating the metal as if it were a page being thumped.

Halven’s hand goes to his seal-ring, but he doesn’t draw it. “It’s trying to route itself through anything that counts as a ‘witness,’” he warns, eyes flicking to the courier’s raised cloak. “Cloth counts. Breath counts. You’re buying seconds, not safety.”

From the seam, a thin line of soot on your new arc lifts—just one grain’s worth—hovering, then settling again, as if something inside has learned exactly where your boundary is and is tracing it from below.

#### Turn 104 **[PLAYER]**

I grab a pinch of soot and smear it across my lips and under my nose, then whisper, “Courier—lower the cloak. Hold your breath and turn your face to the wall, hands over your ears.”  

To Halven, very low: “That syllable—did you catch which? If it’s a Name-start, we gag it.” I sprinkle a thin second crescent of ash just outside the salt-arc and tap my warded paper down over the “giving edge” like a lid-seal, listening for the seam to answer.

*Agent reasoning: It’s seeking a witness-channel; I want to cut off breath/cloth as conduits while learning what that syllable was, and reinforce the arc without escalating with iron unless necessary.*

#### Turn 105 **[GAME]**

You smear soot across your lips and under your nose. It tastes like old paper burned in a careful fire—dry, bitter, oddly clean. Your own breath feels less *legible* afterward, as if you’ve blurred your mouth’s signature.

The courier lowers the cloak at your whisper. He obeys the rest too—turns his face to the mausoleum wall, clamps his hands over his ears, and holds his breath until his shoulders start to tremble. He’s trying very hard not to become a witness.

Halven tilts his head, listening like a man reading in the dark. “I caught the shape of it,” he murmurs. “Not a full syllable—more like the *start* of one. ‘El—’ or ‘Al—’. A Name-beginning, yes. It’s shopping for a throat.”

You lay a second crescent of ash just outside the salt-arc. The ash line doesn’t repel the seam so much as it *misdirects* it: the seam’s pressure drifts toward the ash like a hungry nose following smoke.

You tap your warded paper down over the giving edge.

For two heartbeats there is nothing—then the seam answers, not with ticking this time, but with a wet, thread-pull sound: *tch… tcha…* like stitches tightening in cloth. The warded paper tugs under your fingertips as if something beneath is trying to “read through” it.

A thin, pale filament—no thicker than a hair—pushes out from the seam and touches the underside of your warded sheet. The moment it makes contact, ink on your paper shivers into a tiny, involuntary loop—one letter’s worth—before your wards force it still.

Halven’s hand shoots out and clamps your wrist, hard. “Don’t let it write on your page,” he says. “It’s making a handle.”

The filament withdraws, then returns to a different point along the giving edge, searching. Each touch makes a faint *scratch* on the underside of your warded paper, like someone testing nib pressure.

Behind you, the courier finally has to breathe. He inhales sharply through his nose—just once.

The seam reacts immediately. The lid bumps upward against your paper with a small, decisive *knock*, and from inside comes that muffled start again—closer, clearer, forced through whatever counts as hearing:

“Al—”

The threat is specific now: the sealed thing is trying to anchor a Name into any available witness (breath, hearing, writable surface). Your warded paper is resisting, but each contact risks it “catching” a letter.

*Simulation triggers: watcher_Ed On The **[vacant]**_0_48ca0c*

#### Turn 106 **[PLAYER]**

I yank my warded paper away before it can “catch” another letter, crumple it ink-side inward, and shove it into my satchel’s ward-pocket. “Courier—stop breathing, now. Pinch your nose and bite your sleeve,” I hiss, then press my soot-smeared palm flat over the giving edge to mute both seam and sound.

To Halven, tight and urgent: “If it’s ‘Al—’, give me any counter-syllable—anything that unhooks Name-starts. And do you have wax? I want the seam *stuffed*—no air, no filament.”

*Agent reasoning: It’s trying to anchor a Name through writing and hearing; I need to remove writable surfaces and dampen sound fast, while keeping the seal pressed and redirecting its “search.”*

#### Turn 107 **[GAME]**



*Simulation triggers: watcher_Ed On The **[vacant]**_0_48ca0c*

#### Turn 108 **[PLAYER]**

I clap my soot-smeared palm hard over the giving edge and lean my weight into it, keeping my face turned away. “Courier—pinch your nose, bite your sleeve, eyes shut; do *not* inhale the seam,” I snap.  

Without looking up, I ask Halven, “Do you have wax or pitch—anything to pack the seam? And give me a counter-syllable to break a Name-start—something we can repeat without becoming a witness.”

*Agent reasoning: The seam is trying to anchor through breath, hearing, and writable surfaces; I need to cut off witnesses and physically choke the gap while getting Halven to supply a counter-syllable or sealing material.*

#### Turn 109 **[GAME]**

Your palm hits the giving edge with a dull *whap*. The metal is cold enough to sting through soot. You lean in—full weight, shoulder locked—keeping your face angled away.

It works, immediately and brutally: the lid can’t bump. The seam can’t “knock” itself into sound. The pressure under your hand turns into a trapped tremor, like a throat trying to speak with fingers on its mouth. Fine vibrations crawl up your wrist bones.

The courier jerks into the posture you order—nose pinched, sleeve between his teeth, eyes clenched shut. He makes a small, involuntary whine through fabric, then goes silent. You can see his chest trying not to rise.

Halven steps in close on your blind side so his shadow blocks the seam from any stray lamplight. “Wax—yes,” he says, already digging into the inner pocket of his warden’s coat. “Seal-wax pellets. Not much.” He presses three dull, amber beads into your free hand without letting them clatter.

“Pitch, no. But—” He pulls a stubby taper from a case and sparks it against his thumb-seal. A thin, steady flame catches—controlled, Concord-clean.

At your question about a counter-syllable, Halven’s jaw tightens. “You don’t *repeat* it,” he says. “Repetition makes a chorus. A chorus makes a doorway.” He leans to your ear, careful not to project toward the seam, and breathes the instruction as close as possible:

“Break it with a null-mark. Not a word. A sound that means ‘unwritten.’ Click your tongue once, then exhale through teeth—*tch*—like crossing out ink. Do it only when it starts. Not before.”

Under your palm, the seam tests you: the tremor shifts, concentrating at one corner. Something hair-thin tries to worry its way between lid and frame. You feel a faint, slick pressure—like a filament pressing against skin, seeking a pore or crease.

Halven holds the taper low. “If you lift even a finger, it’ll try to speak again,” he warns. “But if we melt wax into the edge, it’ll have to burn through to find air.”

The threat is immediate and physical now: a filament is probing for any gap under your hand, while the trapped Name-start is waiting for a moment of air or hearing to latch onto.

*Simulation triggers: watcher_Ed On The **[vacant]**_0_48ca0c*

#### Turn 110 **[PLAYER]**

“Halven—drip the wax along the edge under my wrist, slow. I’ll shift by knuckles—no air.”

I keep my face averted, then inch my palm a finger-width at a time, sliding pressure so there’s never a gap, and let one wax pellet soften in my free hand to smear into the corner where the filament worries. If the seam tries to voice that “Al—” again, I click once and cut it off with a sharp *tch* through my teeth.

*Agent reasoning: I need to keep pressure so it can’t speak, but also seal the seam; I’ll coordinate Halven to drip wax while I “walk” my hand to avoid gaps, and be ready to null-mark if it starts a syllable.*

#### Turn 111 **[GAME]**

Halven brings the taper in low, shielding the flame with his sleeve. “Steady,” he says, and tips the first pellet into the heat until it beads, then runs like honey.

You shift by knuckles exactly as promised—pressure never fully leaving the lid. Halven threads the wax into the seam under your wrist in a slow, careful line. The first drip hisses as it meets the necropolis-cold metal, then clings. A second drip follows, then a third, each one thickening into a glossy ridge.

Under your palm, the trapped tremor changes pitch—less “throat,” more “insect in a jar.” The filament makes its move at the corner you’ve been feeling: it presses hard enough that you feel a distinct *sting*, like a needle trying to find purchase between skin and nail.

You soften a pellet in your free hand until it’s tacky, then smear it into that corner—wax pushed firmly into the angle where lid meets frame.

The filament touches the fresh wax and sticks.

For a heartbeat it holds—then it *pulls*, trying to draw the wax inward like thread through cloth. The wax stretches in a thin, pale strand… and snaps. The filament recoils, leaving a tiny hooked impression in the wax like a cursive thorn.

From inside, the thing attempts sound again—muffled, forced, furious. The beginning of the syllable gathers against the sealed edge:

“Al—”

You click once and cut it with a sharp *tch*.

The effect is immediate but not gentle. The sound inside collapses as if struck. The seam shudders so hard the lid tries to buck—your forearm absorbs the jolt. Halven flinches, then steadies his taper.

“Good,” he mutters, voice tight. “Only on the start.”

But the null-sound has a consequence: the wax ridge you’ve just laid darkens in a thin line, as if a scorch-mark wrote itself across it. Not burned by flame—burned by *denial*. The ridge holds, yet you can see it turning brittle where the “unwritten” touched the Name-start.

The courier, still biting sleeve, makes a panicked, tiny inhale through his teeth. The seam answers at once—another hair-thin probe scrapes along the wax line, searching for the weak, darkened section.

Halven swears under his breath and drips more wax to reinforce it. “If the courier breaks,” he says, “it’ll keep testing the wax until it finds a voice-gap. And if the wax goes brittle all the way through, it won’t need air—it’ll make a crack that *sounds* like a mouth.”

#### Turn 112 **[PLAYER]**

Without lifting my face toward the seam, I bark to the courier, “Kneel—forehead to the wall. Press your palms flat over your nose and mouth and breathe *into your hands* only. Slow. Count with your fingers—no sound.”

To Halven, low: “Can we blunt the Name-start without the null-click—salt-hum, prayer-breath, anything that doesn’t turn wax brittle?” I slide a strip of warded paper from my satchel, fold it ink-side out into a tight band, and press it over the wax ridge like a splint, sealing its edges down with soot-salt paste while keeping my other hand’s pressure pinned to the lid.

*Agent reasoning: The courier’s breath is the biggest risk; I need to stabilize him and reinforce the seal without using the null-sound too much, since it brittles the wax. I’ll distract/occupy the courier with a physical task and add a nonverbal ward—paper bandage over wax—while asking Halven about alternatives.*

Without turning my face toward the seam, I snap at the courier, “Kneel—forehead to the wall. Palms over your nose and mouth; breathe *into your hands* only, slow. Count on your fingers—no sound.”

I murmur to Halven, “Any way to blunt a Name-start without the null-click—salt-hum, prayer-breath, anything that won’t make the wax go brittle?” Keeping one hand clamped on the lid, I pull a strip of warded paper, fold it ink-side out into a tight band, and press it over the wax ridge like a splint, smearing soot-salt paste along the edges to seal it down.

*Agent reasoning: The seam is hunting for breath and sound; I need to control the courier’s breathing and reinforce the wax without using the brittle-making null-click, while asking Halven for a safer countermeasure.*

#### Turn 115 **[GAME]**

The courier obeys fast—drops to his knees with a scrape of cloth on stone, forehead to the wall. He clamps his palms over nose and mouth as ordered. His breathing turns into a muffled, wet push into his own hands; his shoulders rise and fall in slow, counted beats. No voice escapes—just a faint skin-squeak as his fingers tick numbers.

That helps immediately: the seam stops “listening” for him. The probing along the wax ridge becomes less frantic, more methodical—like a quill testing paper instead of a mouth hunting air.

Halven answers your murmur without lifting his eyes to the lid. “Yes. Don’t *deny* it—*drown* it.” He shifts his taper away from the ridge so he isn’t heating the brittle line. “Concord uses a low prayer-hum. No consonants. All breath and vowel. It muddies the first letter without striking it.”

He demonstrates once, almost inaudible: a steady, throat-deep *oooo* shaped through closed lips, more vibration than sound.

You pull your warded paper strip. The moment it clears your satchel, the ink-side-out fold catches a sliver of mothlight and the warding glyphs wake—thin lines on the paper rise like gooseflesh. The air near the seam tightens as if the paper has just become the most interesting “page” in the alley.

You press the band over the wax ridge like a splint. It adheres—at first.

Then the seam reacts to the warding: a sharp internal scrape runs the length of the lid, and a hair-thin filament *hooks* the paper band from underneath. You feel it tug, trying to pull the strip into the seam the way a needle pulls thread.

You smear soot-salt paste along the edges. The salt bites—there’s a faint crackle, and the filament recoils, leaving a tiny tear in the paper where it snagged. The soot makes the paste tacky; it seals the band down, but unevenly. One corner puckers where the filament tested it.

Outcome: the “splint” holds for now, and the seam can’t easily probe the wax line. Consequence: the warded paper has become a lure—epitaph-spirits nearby shift toward you. At the edge of lamplight, two pale, letter-streaked wisps detach from a headstone and begin drifting closer, slow but intent, drawn to the exposed warding like hungry readers.

Halven keeps humming under his breath, steadying the lid with his shadow. “Keep that hum going,” he says, voice barely there. “If those spirits reach the paper, they’ll try to *finish* whatever it’s protecting.”

#### Turn 116 **[PLAYER]**

I keep the low *oooo* hum going through closed lips, steadying my breath, and without lifting my sealing hand I swing my reliquary lamp outward to cast a wider mothlight arc—trying to herd the two letter-wisps back toward their headstone.  

In a whisper to Halven: “Epitaph-spirits—do they bargain if I offer them a safer text? If I peel the ward-strip off and replace it with plain paper, will the seam surge?”

*Agent reasoning: The warded paper is drawing epitaph-spirits; I want to learn what they are but can’t let them “finish” the ward. I’ll keep the hum to blunt the Name-start, use my lamp’s light to herd the wisps away, and try a quick question to Halven about negotiating with them.*

#### Turn 117 **[GAME]**

Your closed-lip *oooo* turns your jaw into a tuning fork. The vibration runs down your wrist into the lid; the seam’s frantic “mouth-feel” dulls, as if its first letter is being smudged in wet ink.

Without lifting your sealing hand, you swing the reliquary lamp outward.

The mothlight arc widens—ash-gold and bruised violet spilling across the nearest headstones. The two letter-wisps react like startled moths: they hesitate, their streaked bodies thinning, then drift sideways away from the brightest part of the beam.

It’s only half a herding. One wisp retreats toward its headstone and presses against the carved name there, dissolving into the letters like breath into stone.

The other does not go back. It skirts the edge of your light instead—clever, hungry—circling to keep the warded strip in sight. It’s closer now, a pale ribbon of punctuation with a faint face inside it, mouth a crease that keeps trying to open.

Your lamp’s wider cast also catches something on the wall behind Halven: a pasted square of paper so thin it’s almost skin. For a blink, a pinhole in it gleams wetly—like an inked eyelid closing. Then it looks like nothing again.

Halven answers your whisper without breaking his own low hum. “They bargain,” he breathes, “but not like people. They trade in *completion*. Give them a ‘safer text’ and they’ll still try to finish it—sometimes by finishing you.”

He glances at the warded splint, then at your lamp. “If you peel the ward-strip, the seam will test the gap the instant it feels air. It won’t explode, but it will *probe*—fast. Plain paper won’t stop it; it’ll just become something it can write through.”

As if to prove him right, the seam gives a short, hard push under your palm—one decisive buck—then settles again under the hum. The warded strip puckers where the filament snagged earlier. You feel the hook searching that weak spot, patient now.

The remaining letter-wisp completes its circle and starts drifting in, drawn to the puckered corner. Threat clear: if it reaches the ward-strip, it will latch and “read” the warding—pulling at it until either the strip tears free or the seal is worried open.

I keep the closed-lip *oooo* going and hold firm pressure on the lid. With my free hand I flick out a decoy scrap of plain paper and smear a quick line of fresh soot-ink on it—bold, unfinished—then extend it into the mothlight to draw the wisp away from the puckered corner.  

Without turning my face toward the seam, I murmur to Halven, “That pasted paper on the wall—did you see it blink? If it’s a watcher, can you peel it or pin it without breaking your shadow on the seam?”

*Agent reasoning: The letter-wisp is about to latch onto the warded strip; I want to distract it with something else “readable” while keeping the seal stable and investigating that blinking paper-eye on the wall.*

#### Turn 120 **[PLAYER]**

I keep the closed-lip *oooo* humming and my sealing hand pinned hard on the lid. With my free hand I flick out a plain scrap, drag a bold unfinished soot-ink line across it, and hold it out into the mothlight to tempt the wisp away from the puckered corner.  

Without turning toward the seam, I murmur to Halven, “Did you see that pasted paper on the wall blink? If it’s a watcher, can you peel or pin it without breaking your shadow on the seam?”

*Agent reasoning: The letter-wisp is homing in on the puckered weak spot; a decoy “unfinished text” might lure it off the ward-strip. Also, that blinking paste-sheet on the wall feels like a hidden watcher; I want Halven to deal with it without losing pressure/shadow on the seam.*

#### Turn 121 **[GAME]**

Your hum stays steady; the seam’s “searching” under your palm slows to a dull, irritated pressure. The lid doesn’t buck this time.

You flick out the plain scrap and drag a thick, unfinished soot-ink line across it—one bold stroke that stops mid-thought. The moment you hold it into the mothlight, the letter-wisp snaps its attention to it like a starving eye catching a title.

It drifts off the puckered corner and glides toward your decoy. When it reaches the paper, it doesn’t “bite” so much as *overlay* itself—its punctuation-streak body flattening across the line. The unfinished stroke starts to creep, not with your hand but with the wisp’s hunger: the soot smears forward a few millimeters, as if the paper is trying to complete the mark.

Consequence: it worked—your ward-strip gets a brief reprieve. But now the wisp is anchored to something you’re holding. The decoy scrap grows cold and slightly heavier, as though it’s taking on the weight of a sentence.

Halven answers your murmur, eyes still on the lid. “I saw it.” His voice stays low, threaded through his own hum. “That’s not a spirit. That’s a *listening page*—Concord uses them, Syndicate copies them. Either way, it reports.”

He shifts his stance without lifting his shadow from the seam—careful, precise. With two fingers of his free hand, he slides a thin iron pin from his cuff and, without looking away, reaches back and *pins the pasted square through its center* into the wall.

The paper on the wall reacts immediately: it twitches like skin. A tiny wet dot of ink blooms around the pinhead, then runs in a hairline toward the nearest crack in the stone—trying to “escape” as writing.

Halven hisses, “It’s still transmitting—slow. If it finishes that line into the crack, someone will know exactly where we are.”

At the same time, the seam senses the brief shift in Halven’s shadow and gives a single probing *scrape* under your palm—testing the edge of your ward-strip again. It doesn’t break through, but you feel the hook find the old snag point and worry it.

Threats now, clear and immediate:
1) The wisp is latched to your decoy scrap; if you pull it back toward you, it may climb your hand to reach the warded strip again.
2) The pinned listening page is bleeding a line into the wall crack; if it completes, your location gets reported.
3) The seam has re-found the weak puckered corner and is actively worrying it under your pressure.

I keep the *oooo* humming and my palm welded to the lid, then let the decoy scrap drop to the ground at arm’s length and pin it under my boot so the wisp stays busy finishing it down there instead of crawling up my hand.  

Without looking up, I flick a pinch of soot-salt paste off my fingertips onto the wall crack where the listening page’s ink-thread is running, trying to crust the line and stop it from “writing” into the stone. “Halven—if it still tries to transmit, can you yank the pin and fold the page in on itself, or will that break your shadow?”

*Agent reasoning: The listening page is an urgent “someone will know” problem, but I can’t let the seam get air; I’ll keep pressure/hum, use the wisp-latched scrap as a disposable sink, and try to salt-break the listening page’s ink line at the crack without stepping away.*

#### Turn 129 **[GAME]**

Your *oooo* holds like a cork in a bottle. The reliquary lamp’s lid shivers under your palm—hotter, then cold—then steadies, as if whatever was inside has to settle for listening instead of speaking.

The decoy scrap flutters down. The epitaph-wisp—thin as breath, letters crawling along its edges—dives for it immediately. It presses itself to the paper the way a thirsty mouth finds a cup. Under your boot, the scrap goes damp and dark; the wisp’s script *finishes* lines that were never written, carving tiny, neat strokes into the fibers. It is occupied—hungry, intent.

Your soot-salt paste hits the wall crack with a soft *tch*. It crusts fast, turning the hairline fissure into a jagged seam of black-white scab. The ink-thread that had been strung there twitches once—like a muscle cut mid-spasm—then goes still. A faint, bitter smell rises (burnt candle-wick and iron).

Halven Rook doesn’t look away from the seam. He shifts his stance so his lantern-shadow stays pinned across the crack like a bandage. “I can,” he murmurs, voice tight. “But if my shadow slips, it’ll *hear* again.”

He slides two fingers under the pin holding the listening page, and with a careful, practiced motion, *unpins* it without lifting the paper from the wall. He folds it inward—once, twice—creasing it into a small, blind packet while keeping his body between the seam and the fold. The page gives a tiny, papercut squeal as if something inside it resists being shut.

“What it’s trying to say?” Halven swallows. “Not a message. A *route.* It’s writing coordinates in epitaph-cant—grave names as street names. It wants the lamp to walk itself to the stitched door.”

As he finishes the last fold, the crusted seam answers with a dull *tap* from inside the wall, like a knuckle testing a coffin lid. The wisp under your boot shudders—still feeding—but its strokes speed up, frantic, as if trying to complete the decoy before you move.

I keep the *oooo* going, lean my weight harder onto the booted scrap, and hiss, “Finish, then—show me where,” like I’m coaxing a shy librarian. Without lifting my palm from the lid, I slide a warded sheet from my satchel and edge it toward the scrap to “catch” whatever route the wisp is carving when it’s done.

To Halven, still low: “Don’t crush that folded page—can I see its creases? If it wrote a route once, it might’ve left a ghost of it.” I glance at the crusted crack and then back to the lid’s seam, asking, “And the stitched door—here, or somewhere it wants us to *go*?”

*Agent reasoning: The “route” clue is too juicy to ignore—I want to capture it without letting the wisp climb me, and I want to inspect the folded listening page for any remaining text while keeping the seam sealed.*

#### Turn 132 **[PLAYER]**

I keep the closed-lip *oooo* steady and grind my boot down just enough to keep the wisp pinned to the decoy, then slide a warded sheet from my satchel and edge it under the scrap to catch the last strokes as it “finishes.”  

Without lifting my palm from the lid, I murmur to Halven, “Let me see the fold-creases—slowly—don’t crush it; if there’s a ghost-route I can rub it up.” I flick my eyes to the crusted crack. “The stitched door—is it in this wall, or is this thing trying to send us somewhere else?”

*Agent reasoning: The wisp is actively writing a “route,” so I want to capture it without letting it climb me or alert the seam again; Halven’s folded listening page might hold an imprint, and I need to learn whether the stitched door is local or a destination.*

#### Turn 133 **[GAME]**

Your *oooo* stays unbroken. The lamp’s lid warms under your palm, as if it’s trying to push up—then thinks better of it.

Under your boot, the wisp clings to the decoy scrap like wet cobweb. When you grind down, it doesn’t tear free; it *spreads*, flattening into a thin film of script that keeps writing even while pinned. The paper beneath your sole goes slick, ink seeping out at the edges.

You slide a warded sheet under the decoy. The moment the warded paper touches the ink-wet edge, the wisp reacts like a startled insect: its strokes jump sideways—off the decoy and onto your clean sheet—because the warding gives it a “surface that holds.”

In three quick, decisive lines, it finishes a crude route:

- a moth-wing sigil,
- three circled mausoleums,
- and a narrow rectangle marked with stitch-marks like a doorframe.

Then the wisp goes slack, the script paling to gray. It doesn’t vanish; it’s just…sated and dull, like an emptied pen.

Halven obeys your tone. He brings the folded listening page closer without unfolding it, angling it so your lamp-light grazes the creases. In the fold-lines, a faint “ghost-route” shows—indentations like the memory of a diagram. You can make out the same three circles, but one is crossed out and rewritten, as if the route has been *edited* since it was first recorded.

Halven whispers, “It’s not in this wall.” He nods at the crusted crack. “This seam was a listening point—like a keyhole. The stitched door is elsewhere. But—” he pauses as the wall answers with another dull *tap*, closer to the surface, testing the crust, “—something on the other side heard enough to start trying anyway.”

At the base of the crack, the soot-salt scab freckles—tiny pinpricks appearing as if pricked from within. A thin, dark dampness beads there, ink-black and slow, threatening to undermine your crust.

And from somewhere down the necropolis path, you hear the crisp scrape of boots and the soft clink of page-seals: Warden-Scribes moving in pairs, sweeping the corridor.

#### Turn 134 **[PLAYER]**

I snatch the warded route-sheet up and tuck it flat into my satchel sleeve, then, still humming, I press two fingers to Halven’s folded page and take a quick charcoal rub along the crease-lines onto a scrap of my own paper. “Good—edited route means someone’s correcting the map.”

I scrape the slack wisp-film and the soaked decoy into a tight wad and flick it toward the crack’s base to “feed” the weeping ink, then smear another quick band of soot-salt paste over the new pinpricks. To Halven, urgent whisper: “Wardens. Which mausoleum is closest—first circle or the crossed-out one? Lead, but keep your shadow off that seam.”

*Agent reasoning: Wardens are approaching, and the seam is starting to fail; I want to preserve the new route and the ghost-route, then get us out while leaving a misleading trail and buying time.*

#### Turn 135 **[GAME]**

The warded route-sheet slides into your satchel sleeve cleanly—no snag, no bleed. Your hum keeps the air steady enough that the lamp doesn’t flare.

You press two fingers to Halven’s folded page and take your charcoal rub fast. The crease-lines bite back immediately: on your scrap, the “ghost-route” comes up as a shallow-relief diagram—three circles, one crossed out and rewritten with a tighter hand. In the margin, half-caught by the rub, there’s a thumbprint-shaped smudge of funerary gold dust—old, ground into the fold like it’s been handled at an auction table.

Halven’s eyes flick to that gold smear. His jaw tightens. He doesn’t comment, but he folds the page closer to his chest like it’s suddenly heavier.

You scrape the slack wisp-film and soaked decoy into a wad and flick it to the crack’s base. The weeping ink doesn’t “drink” it so much as *wick* it: the wad sticks to the dampness and begins to blacken from the edges inward, as if the wall is pulling the wet text through. For a second, the pinpricks stop widening.

You smear a fresh band of soot-salt over the new holes. It crusts—then immediately dimples, like something presses from behind. The dimples hold. Not broken, but under pressure.

Down the corridor, the boot-scrape resolves into voices—close enough to catch words.

“—satchel checks. Lamps forward. Pages out.”

Two Concord Warden-Scribes round the far bend, lanterns hooded to slits. Between them walks Acolyte Senn, head lowered, carrying a ledger-board like a shield.

Halven answers your question without turning his head, keeping his lantern-shadow pinned across the seam. “Closest is the *crossed-out* one,” he breathes. “They corrected it because the honest path collapsed. If we go for the first circle, we’ll loop.”

He shifts—carefully—so his shadow stays on the crack, but his body angles toward a narrow side passage between leaning headstones. “We move on my count. If my shadow slips, that thing starts listening again—and if the Wardens hear it tapping, they’ll blame the lamp.”

At the crack, the soot-salt band gives a soft, wet *tick*—a single stitch-like sound—then goes still.

#### Turn 136 **[PLAYER]**

I keep the hum steady, slide my palm off the lid as gently as a bookmark, and drift toward Halven’s side passage with my satchel hugged tight. As we move, I call out softly toward the Wardens in my best dutiful tone, “Ledger-run for the Concord—ink leak sealed; we’re headed to the crossed-out mausoleum to verify a collapse mark.”  

Once we’re in the shadow of the leaning stones, I whisper to Halven, “That gold thumbprint—auction handling, right? Who’s been buying routes?”

*Agent reasoning: Wardens are about to spot us; I’m curious about Senn and that funerary gold, but we need to move. I’ll try a quick misdirect with a scribe-y lie while slipping into the side passage, and quietly probe Halven about the gold once we’re moving.*

#### Turn 137 **[GAME]**

Your hum stays steady as you ease your palm off the lid. The lamp doesn’t flare—good—but the moment your hand leaves, the hood’s seam gives a tiny *sigh* of heat, like it wanted contact.

Halven moves when you do, keeping his body between the crack and open sightlines. You drift into the side passage between leaning stones, your satchel hugged tight; the stones are close enough to brush your shoulders with lichen that feels like dry, curled paper.

Your dutiful call carries.

One Warden-Scribe stops dead and lifts his lantern to a narrow slit. “Ledger-run?” he repeats, skeptical. The other’s gaze drops immediately to your satchel, then to your lamp. Acolyte Senn looks up sharply at the phrase “crossed-out mausoleum,” and you see his throat bob as he swallows.

“Name your superior,” the first Warden calls, stepping toward the passage mouth. “And show the page-seal.”

Halven answers before you can. “Rook. Warden-Scribe Halven Rook. This is my runner.” He raises his own seal-ring into the lantern slit, letting the Concord mark catch the light. It buys a heartbeat.

Not trust—just procedure. The nearer Warden slows, but doesn’t retreat. “Rook. You’re off-route,” he says, and his free hand already has a thin strip of binding paper ready, like a leash for a page. “Satchel check anyway. Curfew protocol.”

Behind you, from the direction of the crack, comes a faint, wet *tick tick*—two stitch-sounds this time—followed by a soft, hungry inhale against stone. The soot-salt is holding, but whatever is behind it has noticed the shadow moved away.

In the shadow of the leaning stones, you whisper about the gold thumbprint.

Halven’s eyes cut to the charcoal rubbing in your hand. “Yes,” he murmurs, voice tight. “Auction handling. Grave-Gild tables use that gold powder to ‘bless’ lots—makes buyers feel clean.”

He glances past you toward Senn and the Wardens, then back. “Who’s buying? People with money and fear. But the last consistent bidder—” his mouth flattens, “—used a monastery thumbprint. Restricted stacks. Someone who *shouldn’t be alive to bid*.”

The nearer Warden steps into the passage mouth, lantern slit widening. “Runner,” he says to you, “satchel. Now.”

I dip my head obediently and start to open the satchel—slow, fussy—letting only blank warded paper show first. “Of course, Warden; mind the wards, they bite curious fingers.”

Then I tilt my chin toward the corridor behind them, voice tightening as if I’ve just noticed it too: “Do you hear that stitching—*tick tick*—from the sealed crack? If it’s waking, we’ll all be doing paperwork in blood.” I glance at Acolyte Senn. “You heard ‘crossed-out mausoleum’ and went pale—tell them why, before they make a spectacle of my bag.”

Under the cover of the exchange, I edge one step deeper between the leaning stones, keeping my body between the Warden’s lantern and the satchel sleeve where the route-sheet lies flat.

*Agent reasoning: A satchel check will expose the route-sheet and rubbing; I’ll stall with compliant theater, redirect scrutiny to the crack noises, and try to enlist Senn’s fear/knowledge while edging deeper into cover.*

I bow and start opening my satchel slowly, fussily, letting only blank warded sheets show first. “Of course, Warden—mind the wards; they bite curious fingers.”  

I tip my chin toward the corridor. “Do you hear that stitching—*tick tick*—from the sealed crack? If it’s waking, we’ll all be doing paperwork in blood.” I look straight at Acolyte Senn. “You heard ‘crossed-out mausoleum’ and went pale—tell them why, before they make a spectacle of my bag.”  

As they look, I edge one step deeper between the leaning stones, keeping my body between the lantern slit and the satchel sleeve with the route-sheet.

*Agent reasoning: A satchel check could expose the route-sheet, so I’ll comply with harmless contents while redirecting attention to the ominous ticking and press Senn to explain; also inch deeper into shadow to keep the route hidden.*

#### Turn 141 **[GAME]**

You bow and open the satchel with exaggerated care. The first thing the Warden sees is exactly what you want him to see: a neat stack of blank warded sheets, their edges faintly silvered with bite-runes. When his binding-paper hand reaches in, the top sheet gives a dry *snap* and his fingertips jerk back as if stung.

“Tch—” he hisses, shaking his fingers once. “Wards. Fine.”

Your warning about the stitching lands harder. The corridor behind them answers you: *tick tick*—then a third sound, a slow drag like thread being pulled through wet cloth. The air at the passage mouth cools abruptly, and the Warden’s lantern flame gutters to a thin, nervous tongue.

Both Wardens turn their heads toward the sound despite themselves.

Acolyte Senn goes rigid. His eyes fix on the dark corridor, not your satchel. “It’s—” he starts, then swallows. “That crack was sealed with a concordance stitch. If it’s ticking, it means the seam is… being read.”

“Being read by what?” the second Warden snaps, but his voice has lost some authority.

Senn forces the words out, fast and ashamed. “An epitaph-spirit. A hungry one. It listens for lamplight and unfinished lines.”

Halven doesn’t waste the opening. He steps half a pace forward—just enough to block the Wardens from pushing deeper into your little side passage—and points his lantern toward the corridor as if to take command of the problem. “You heard the acolyte,” he says. “If you want a spectacle, stand here and let it wake fully.”

While their attention is dragged toward the corridor, you edge one step deeper between the leaning stones.

You get the concealment you wanted for a heartbeat—then your heel nudges something half-buried in moss: a small memorial bell on a hair-knot cord. It doesn’t ring. It *clicks* once, sharply, like a page-tab.

The nearer Warden’s eyes snap back to you immediately.

“Hold,” he says, and this time he doesn’t reach into your satchel. He reaches for *you*—grabbing at your wrist to stop you backing farther in. “No further. Runner stays where I can see her.”

At the corridor mouth, the *tick tick* becomes a steady, patient rhythm, and the soot-salt smell turns sour, like damp ash. The crack isn’t open, but it is actively working—pressing, listening—drawn by the lamp’s presence and the Wardens’ exposed lanternflame.

Senn looks between the corridor and your lamp, voice thin. “Warden… we should hood the lights. Now.”

I let the Warden catch my wrist but go limp, palms open. “Fine—keep hold; just don’t drag me into lamplight.”

I nod sharply at Senn. “Yes. Hood them—now—unless you want it reading *your* names next.” With my free hand I reach down and lift the little memorial bell by its hair-knot cord, holding it up for the Wardens to see. “This is a grave-tab; it’ll answer the seam if it’s listening. Warden—do I have leave to click it once, or will you?”

*Agent reasoning: The epitaph-spirit is reacting to light and unfinished lines; I need to de-escalate the Wardens, protect the route-sheet, and use the bell as a possible focus/distraction while getting everyone to hood their lamps.*

#### Turn 143 **[GAME]**

The Warden’s grip on your wrist tightens, but he doesn’t yank you—more a clamp than a drag. “Stay,” he says through his teeth, eyes flicking between your lamp and the corridor.

Senn reacts to your barked order like it’s a lifeline. He snaps his lantern-hood down with both hands. The light collapses from a steady glow to a thin crescent. The other Warden follows a beat later, muttering a quick Concord syllable as he shutters his own lantern. The path around you dims; the air pressure in the corridor eases slightly, like something disappointed.

The *tick tick* from the sealed crack slows.

Not stops—slows, as if listening closer.

You lift the memorial bell by its hair-knot cord. Up close it’s not a bell at all—no clapper, no hollow. It’s a little brass tab stamped with a name that’s been scratched off so hard the metal is furred with burrs. The cord smells faintly of old rosemary and scalp-oil.

Halven’s eyes narrow at it. “Grave-tab,” he confirms, low. “A locator. Someone left it to be found.”

The Warden holding your wrist doesn’t like that. “You don’t have leave to signal anything,” he snaps, and reaches with his free hand to take the tab from you.

The moment his fingers close around the brass, the tab gives a single, involuntary *click*—not loud, but sharp enough to feel in your teeth.

The corridor answers immediately.

From the soot-salted crack comes a wet, satisfied inhale, and the seam-line—previously just a dark cut in stone—briefly brightens with hair-thin script, as if ink is surfacing under skin. A few letters become readable before they twist away: **…ROO— …SENN—** then smear into illegible loops.

Senn pales to the color of candle tallow. “It— it’s indexing us,” he whispers.

The Warden jerks his hand back from the tab as if it burned him. The tab drops, still dangling from your fingers. His grip on your wrist loosens half a fraction—not kindness, but fear.

Then the crack gives a soft, tearing *thip*, like a stitch pulled too tight.

A line of black thread—no thicker than a hair—pushes out through the seal and hangs in the air, wavering toward the nearest warmth and light: the thin crescent under Senn’s hood.

“It’s not open,” Halven says, voice controlled but urgent. “But it’s reaching.”

The thread twitches, testing the air, and begins to drift—slowly, purposefully—toward Senn’s lantern.

“Snuff it, Senn—full hood, no crescent.” I twist my lamp’s hood down to a hairline too, then yank a blank warded sheet from my satchel and sweep it gently between the thread and Senn’s lantern like a screen.

With the same motion I press the sheet’s bite-rune edge toward the drifting thread to catch and pinch it, murmuring, “Read *this* instead,” and try to snip it free with a quick scrape of my charcoal stick. I scoop the grave-tab cord into my fist and hiss to Halven, “If it’s indexing names—can we feed it a false one? What’s the Concord’s dummy epitaph?”

*Agent reasoning: The thread is drawn to light/heat and is indexing names—dangerous. I want to protect Senn and learn what the grave-tab is keyed to, so I’ll snuff the lure, sever the thread safely, and pocket the tab for later study.*

#### Turn 148 **[PLAYER]**

“Snuff it fully, Senn—no crescent.” I hood my reliquary lamp down to a slit and slide a blank warded sheet between the thread and the lantern-light like a shield.  

Keeping my hands steady, I pinch the drifting black thread against the sheet’s bite-rune edge and scrape at it with my charcoal stick to sever it.  

Without looking away from the seam, I hiss to Halven, “If it’s indexing names, what’s the Concord’s dummy epitaph—what false name do you feed a hungry ledger to make it choke?”

*Agent reasoning: There’s no new scene text, so I’ll press the immediate threat: block the thread, reduce light, and interrogate Halven/Senn for a decoy-name while trying a warded capture.*

#### Turn 149 **[GAME]**

Senn obeys so fast his fingers fumble; his hood snaps fully shut with a dull *clack*. The last crescent of lantern-light dies. Your own reliquary lamp narrows to a slit—just enough to see stone texture and the wet shine of the seam.

The black thread hesitates midair as if it’s lost the scent.

You slide the blank warded sheet in front of it. The warding takes—faint, chalky lines on the paper wake like sleeping ink, forming a shallow “bite” along the rune-edge. When you pinch the thread to that edge, it catches with a tiny, resistant *tink*, like snagging a hook on cloth.

The moment you murmur “Read this instead,” the thread shivers and presses into the paper. Letters start to bruise up through the sheet from the point of contact—backwards at first, then trying to right themselves. It’s indexing the page.

You scrape with the charcoal stick.

Charcoal is not a blade. It smears, grinds, and—worse—*writes*. The scrape leaves a thick black streak across the warded sheet, and the thread responds like a fish feeling a tug: it tightens, then *splits* into two finer hairs rather than snapping clean. One hair stays pinned in your bite-rune edge; the other whips free and darts back toward the seam.

It hits the crack and vanishes inside with a soft, hungry *sip*.

The seam immediately brightens with hair-thin script again, faster now, as if rewarded. Names try to assemble along the stone, stuttering: **ELD—** then crossed through by a wriggle of ink; **SENN** half-formed; **ROOK** briefly legible before it blurs.

Halven flinches at his own name appearing, then forces his voice steady. “Yes,” he says, low. “We have a dummy epitaph. We call it the *Ashen Witness*. ‘Here lies ASHEN WITNESS, who saw and said nothing.’ We feed it to ledgers, to traps, to anything that bites names.”

The Warden who’d grabbed you swallows hard. He’s stopped trying to take the tab now; his hand hovers, unsure, watching the writing like it might leap.

In your pinch, the captured hair-thread continues to burrow into the warded sheet, trying to complete a line—its “ink” bleeding into the paper’s fibers. The bite-rune edge holds it, but you can feel the tension climbing: if you let go, it will either lash for the nearest living name again… or drag your sheet toward the seam.

The threat is immediate and specific: the seam is actively indexing you by name, and the remaining thread in your grip is still “reading” and may pull free if the warding slips.

#### Turn 150 **[PLAYER]**

I plant my boot on the bottom edge of the warded sheet to anchor it and, without letting the bite-rune edge slip, I whisper clearly at the seam: “Here lies **ASHEN WITNESS**, who saw and said nothing—index that, and be full.”  

With my free hand I shove the grave-tab cord toward the nearest Warden. “Tie this to that leaning stone—give it an anchor that isn’t *us*.”  

Then I glance at Senn in the dim. “Senn—does the Concordance stitch have a *closing phrase*? Tell me the words, now, before it finishes spelling anyone.”

*Agent reasoning: The seam is indexing our real names; I should bait it with the dummy epitaph while keeping the thread trapped, and anchor the warded sheet so it can’t drag me in.*

#### Turn 154 **[PLAYER]**

I blink into the hooded dark, tightening my grip on the warded sheet. “I’m not seeing the scene—what’s in front of me right now: the seam’s behavior, where Senn and Halven are positioned, and whether the Wardens have taken the cord?”

*Agent reasoning: The scene output is missing; I need clarification to respond in-character without inventing details, but my curiosity pushes me to ask what I can perceive and what options are present.*

#### Turn 155 **[GAME]**

Your hooded lamp is down to a narrow slit of light—enough to see hands, boots, and the seam, but not the ceiling or anything beyond a few paces.

**What’s in front of you:**

- **You / the warded sheet:** You’re crouched close to the mausoleum seam with the **warded sheet** held up near chest height. One edge of it—the “bite-rune” margin—has **one hair-fine strand of stitch-thread** caught and held. The sheet is trembling slightly from the tension in that strand.

- **The seam’s behavior:** The crack in the stone is no longer “quiet.” It’s actively **brightening with hair-thin script**, like a sentence being written too fast to read. Every few seconds, a name almost resolves then gets **crossed out by its own ink**. You can clearly make out fragments as they flare and smear: **ELD—** (then struck through), **SENN** (half-formed), and **ROOK** (legible for a heartbeat before blurring). The seam is *indexing living names*—that’s the threat—and it’s doing it faster than before.

- **Senn:** Senn is **one step behind and to your left**, shoulders hunched, hood snapped shut. He’s holding his hands up near his collar like he’s afraid to touch anything. He’s staring at the seam even though he can barely see it, listening to the scratch-sound of the script. He hasn’t spoken since the hood went down; his breathing is quick and shallow.

- **Halven Rook:** Halven is **to your right**, closer than Senn—about an arm’s length away—half-turned so he can watch both you and the corridor behind. His lantern is also hooded. His jaw is tight; his eyes keep flicking to the momentary appearance of **ROOK** on the seam. He’s ready to grab you or the sheet if it jerks.

- **The other Wardens / the cord:** The nearest Warden **has taken the grave-tab cord**—it’s looped around his gloved hand. He has *not* tied it off yet. He’s looking between Halven and the leaning stone you indicated, hesitating like he expects a command or a punishment for moving wrong. The second Warden is a pace behind him, watching the seam, blade-hand hovering near his belt seal.

**Immediate danger, clearly:** the seam is actively trying to complete and “accept” a living name. If it finishes one cleanly, the air around that person feels like it will *tighten*—as if the mausoleum could claim them by inscription.

#### Turn 156 **[PLAYER]**

I hiss at the Warden with the cord, “Now—tie it off to the leaning stone, tight, and don’t look at the writing.”  

Keeping the thread pinned in the bite-rune edge, I lean toward the seam and speak clearly, steady as a grave-prayer: “Here lies **ASHEN WITNESS**, who saw and said nothing. Index that, and be full.”  

Without turning my head, I murmur to Senn, “Closing phrase—if you know it, give it to me. Even half of it.”

*Agent reasoning: The seam is trying to finalize our names; I need to feed it a false epitaph immediately and get the cord anchored to a stone to divert the pull. I also want Senn to give any closing phrase while Halven watches our backs.*

#### Turn 157 **[GAME]**

The Warden with the cord jolts like you slapped him awake. He nods once—too hard—then turns his face away from the seam and moves by feel.

He hooks the cord around the **leaning headstone** you indicated and yanks it tight. The stone grinds a fraction in the wet soil. The cord goes taut with a low, harp-string hum.

The moment the cord takes tension, the seam’s hairline script **snaps toward it**—not physically, but in attention. The bright fragments that were trying to finish **ROOK** and **SENN** stutter, then smear sideways as if someone dragged a wet quill.

You lean in and speak: **“Here lies ASHEN WITNESS…”**

The seam **answers**.

For a heartbeat the scratch-sound becomes a dry, satisfied **page-turn**. The writing along the crack blooms into a single, clean line—legible in the slit of lamp-light:

**ASHEN WITNESS — WHO SAW AND SAID NOTHING.**

Then the letters sink into the stone like ink into blotting paper. The air pressure around your throat eases—subtle, but real—as if a tightening hand reconsidered.

But “be full” has its own appetite. The seam drinks the offered name and immediately tries to **fill itself further**: new strokes spark, hungry and fast. This time it reaches outward along the cord’s direction, as though the cord is a **bookmark** leading it to the headstone.

At the leaning stone, the cord twitches—once—like something tugged from the other side. The Warden flinches and almost looks, then clamps his eyes shut and braces his boot against the base.

Senn swallows audibly. He finally speaks, voice thin and shaking, keeping his gaze down at your boots.

“C-Closing… we were taught—only as a ward—” He forces the words out like they hurt. “**‘…and let the candle keep what the tongue would steal.’** That’s… that’s the last half. The first half was *never written* in our primers.”

Halven shifts closer to you, low and urgent. “Moth—whatever you just fed it, it noticed the cord. If it finishes an index at that stone, it won’t be a name. It’ll be an *address*.”

*Simulation triggers: guard_Wall_0_6df9f8, fail_Wall_1_874d0d, watcher_Wall_1_fbde05, guard_Wall_1_a56667, secret_Wall_0_203864*

#### Turn 158 **[PLAYER]**

I snap, “Cut the cord—now!” and jab my charcoal at the Warden like a command-staff.  

Still pinning the thread in the bite-rune edge, I whisper to the seam, slow and firm: “By wick and wax—let the candle keep what the tongue would steal.”  

Then, without looking up, I murmur to Senn, “Never written isn’t never spoken—what do you *say* before that line, in the Concord’s rites?”

*Agent reasoning: The seam is using the cord as a pointer; I need to cut that “bookmark” and seal the indexing with the closing phrase fragment. Also I’m curious about the missing first half—maybe I can improvise it from monastic candle-wards.*

#### Turn 159 **[GAME]**

The Warden with the cord hesitates—one fatal half-second of obedience to procedure—then Halven barks, “Do it,” and that breaks him free.

Steel whispers. The Warden draws his short cutter and **saws through the grave-tab cord**.

The instant the fibers part, the taut hum stops—and something on the far end **yanks**.

The severed length snaps sideways and **lashes the Warden’s wrist**, leaving a thin red welt like a paper-cut made of rope. The cut end doesn’t fall limp. It **skitters** across the wet stone toward the seam as if pulled by invisible fingers, then goes still, quivering.

At the leaning headstone, the loop you’d tied slips and drops away. The headstone settles back with a soft, damp **thunk**. Whatever “bookmark” you’d made is gone.

You whisper your closing line into the crack:  
“**By wick and wax—let the candle keep what the tongue would steal.**”

The seam’s frantic script **stutters**. The new strokes that were racing toward the headstone **curl inward**, as if embarrassed to be seen. The scratch-sound becomes a low, irritated hiss—like a quill dragged against sand.

Then the seam “tests” you: three words flare in quick succession, each trying to hook to a living throat.

**MOTH** (half-formed, crossed out)  
**ROOK** (formed, then smeared)  
**SENN** (formed cleanly—too cleanly—and held for a heartbeat)

Senn makes a small choking sound and clamps a hand to his own collar, eyes squeezed shut. Halven steps between Senn and the seam without thinking, shoulder angled like a shield.

You ask Senn for the missing line.

Senn swallows hard. “We… we say it,” he admits, voice barely there. “Just not where ink can catch it.”

He draws one breath, then speaks the forbidden first half in a rush, like spitting out a thorn:

“**By mercy unrecorded and flame uncounted—**”

As the words leave him, the seam’s light surges—hungry—and the clean **SENN** on the stone tries to *finish itself*, adding a trailing flourish like a noose being tied.

Halven’s hand shoots out and clamps over Senn’s mouth. “No more,” he growls—too late to unsay what’s already been offered.

**The threat is immediate and specific:** the seam is now actively attempting to **complete Senn’s inscription**. If it finishes, Senn will be “indexed” the way your offered epithet was—except it will treat him as a living entry to be claimed, not a substitute to be consumed.

#### Turn 160 **[PLAYER]**

I grab Senn by the collar and haul him two steps back behind me and Halven, then snap to Halven, “Keep his mouth covered—no more words.”  

I slap a fresh warded sheet over the seam like a blotter and drag my charcoal hard across where **SENN** is forming, grinding it into a black smear. “Here lies **ASHEN WITNESS**, who saw and said nothing—take that ink, not his breath.”  

Under my breath, I stitch the whole rite together like a single sentence: “By mercy unrecorded and flame uncounted… by wick and wax—let the candle keep what the tongue would steal.”

*Agent reasoning: The seam has latched onto Senn’s true-name inscription; I need to interrupt the “writing” by giving it a safer entry and/or smearing the forming letters, while physically pulling Senn back from the seam’s influence. I’m curious about how it “reads,” but keeping Senn alive comes first.*

#### Turn 167 **[GAME]**

Senn’s next syllable dies under your palm with a wet, panicked swallow. He obeys—nostrils flaring, breathing sharp through his nose—while Halven catches Senn by the collar and hauls him tighter behind his own shoulder like a shield he hates needing.

The seam in the mausoleum stone—hairline at first—had begun to bead ink. Under your warded sheet it spreads anyway, pressing up as raised, blind lettering. The moment your charcoal grinds down, the forming **SENN** buckles. The letters don’t vanish; they *misprint*. The name collapses into a thick bruise of black, and the ink tries to reassert itself at the margins—little hooked strokes searching for a clean edge to climb.

Your epitaph—**ASHEN WITNESS**—lands like a stamp.

The pressure under the paper eases. Not gone—contained. The seam gives a small, audible *tck* as if a stitch has been tightened from the other side. The ink that had been trying to write a name turns greedy and drinks the charcoal instead, wicking it into thread-thin capillaries that spider out across your sheet… and then stop at the warding lines as if hitting glass.

When you breathe the stitch-rite in one unbroken thread, your reliquary lamp answers without being asked: the flame narrows to a needlepoint, then steadies. Warmth travels up your wrist and into the paper, sealing it to the stone with a faint tackiness like cooling wax.

Halven’s eyes flick to the lamp, then to your hands. “You just *reassigned* a claim,” he says, low and hard. “Do you understand what you fed it?”

Senn trembles once, then goes still. When you finally ease your grip enough for him to whisper, he doesn’t speak a name—he rasps, “It was taking my… *index*. Like I was a word in its mouth.”

From the sealed seam comes a new sound: not ink, not breath—*scratching*, slow and deliberate, as if something inside is trying to write its way out around your warded sheet. The paper holds, but the scratching starts to travel laterally along the stone, searching for another place to surface.

#### Turn 168 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my warded sheet pressed with my forearm and angle my reliquary lamp to chase the scratching along the stone, watching for where it wants to surface. “Halven—what does an ‘Ashen Witness’ buy us here, and what does it *owe* later?”  

Without letting Senn speak, I squeeze his shoulder once. “Nod if you can breathe. Don’t answer out loud.”  

I pull a second warded sheet and start laying it edge-to-edge along the direction the scratching travels, like patching a running crack. “If it wants another mouth, we’ll give it paper—show me where you’re trying to write.”

*Agent reasoning: The seam is trying to route around my ward; I want to track where it’s going and learn what “Ashen Witness” cost us. I’ll keep Senn safe, question Halven, and probe the stone with light and paper to map the scratching.*

#### Turn 169 **[GAME]**

You keep the first sheet pinned with your forearm; the wax-tack holds, but it pulls at your skin like a mild burn. When you angle the reliquary lamp, the needle-flame throws a tight oval of light across the mausoleum’s face.

The scratching becomes visible in the lamplight as *movement in the stone’s dust*: fine grit shivers in a line, traveling rightward along a mortar seam. Where it passes, hairline script briefly lifts—pale, raised strokes like dried glue—then collapses back into plain stone. It’s not random. It’s *spelling while it searches*.

Senn nods fast when you squeeze his shoulder—he can breathe. His eyes are wet and fixed on the seam like it’s a throat.

Halven answers your question without taking his gaze off the wall. “An Ashen Witness buys you a substitute—an acceptable silence. It tells the claim there’s already a recorded absence, so it can stop hunting a living name.” His jaw tightens. “What it owes later is simple: testimony. Someday it will come to collect what the witness ‘saw and said nothing’ about. And it will try to make that true.”

You slide the second warded sheet edge-to-edge in the direction the scratching runs. The moment the paper overlaps the seam by a thumb’s width, the scratching *hits it*—hard enough that you feel the vibration through the sheet. A line of ink blooms under the paper like a bruise spreading in water, and for an instant letters try to emboss through from beneath, reversed as if read from inside a coffin.

Then the warding bites. The ink stops at the sigils and begins to pool at the nearest unwarded edge—your overlap line—testing it like a tongue on a loose tooth.

Halven shifts, bracing his shoulder against the mausoleum to keep the sheets from peeling. “It’s learning your seams,” he mutters. “Don’t give it gaps.”

The scratching abruptly detours *downward*, toward the base of the wall. Dust lifts in a narrow stream and skitters into a drainage crack between stones. The threat is clear: it’s trying to surface somewhere your paper can’t easily cover—below, where the wall meets the ground.

From that crack, a thin exhale of cold air leaks out, smelling of wet vellum and old funerary gold.

#### Turn 170 **[PLAYER]**

I swing the lamp low to the base crack and lean in, trying to catch even a fragment of the raised script in the dust. “Halven—hold both sheets flat; Senn, hands over your ears and keep your mouth shut.”

I yank a strip of warded paper from my satchel, fold it into a tight wick, and stuff it into the drainage crack, then press the lamp’s heat close as if to melt wax into a seal. Under my breath: “No mouth below, no mouth above—if you must write, write where I can read you.”

*Agent reasoning: The thing is trying to escape where paper won’t cover—down at the base crack—so I need to redirect or seal that exit fast. I also want to learn what it’s spelling and what “testimony” might mean later, but survival first.*

#### Turn 171 **[GAME]**

You drop the lamp low. The needle-flame paints the base crack in a hard white line, and the dust there isn’t settling—it’s *standing up* in tiny ridges like iron filings near a magnet.

In that dust, for a blink, you catch a fragment of raised script trying to assemble itself along the crack’s lip: **…WITN…** then it shivers apart as if ashamed of being seen.

Halven obeys instantly—both palms flatten on your overlapping warded sheets, shoulders hunched, using his weight to keep the “patch” from lifting. “Senn—do it,” he snaps.

Senn clamps his hands over his ears and presses his lips together so hard they blanch. He keeps his eyes open, staring at your hands like he’s afraid to blink and let a word slip out.

You tear a strip of warded paper, fold it tight into a crude wick, and ram it into the drainage crack. The moment it seats, something on the other side *pulls*—not enough to take it, but enough to make the paper tremble as if being tasted.

When you bring the lamp’s heat close, the reliquary flame reacts like it recognizes a rite: it lengthens, then flattens against the crack as if trying to become wax itself. The air in front of the flame ripples. The warded “wick” darkens at the tip, not burning—*inking*, as if the crack is feeding it pigment.

Your seal works—partly. The cold exhale stops, and the scratching below goes silent.

But the pressure doesn’t disappear. It relocates.

Up under Halven’s hands, the patched seam *bulges* once, like a pulse. Ink spreads under the second sheet in a thin, urgent line, racing for the nearest gap it can find: the edge where the two warded sheets meet. The overlap holds, but the ink starts to *write along the join* in cramped, inverted letters, as if using the seam between papers as its new “mouth.”

Halven jerks as he feels it. “It’s talking anyway,” he growls. “Through the edge.”

Senn makes a muffled sound behind sealed lips—pain, not speech—and squeezes his eyes shut.

The threat is immediate and specific: the thing can’t surface through the stone crack now, so it’s attempting to force legible text along the paper-to-paper seam. If it completes a name or claim there, it may “assign” that claim to whoever is closest to the join—your forearm, Halven’s hands, or Senn’s presence behind you.

#### Turn 172 **[PLAYER]**

“Halven—don’t lift, but slide your hands back an inch, slow.” I pull my forearm off just long enough to slap a third warded sheet crosswise over the join like a bandage, then press my palm flat and let my lamp’s heat ‘wax’ it down into one continuous skin.  

I lean close to the edge-text and, instead of reading it aloud, trace the inverted letters with charcoal into my own notebook as nonsense marks—eyes only—murmuring, “Write for the lantern, not the living.”

*Agent reasoning: The ink is exploiting the join between my sheets; I should remove the “mouth” by making the overlap a single continuous seal, and I want to see what it’s trying to say without letting it complete a claim on any of us.*

#### Turn 173 **[GAME]**

Halven slides his hands back exactly an inch—slow, knuckles whitening—never breaking contact. The ink-line under the seam surges toward the warmth you just vacated, like water seeking a low point.

You lift your forearm for the briefest moment. The patched sheets try to peel with a soft *skritch*—as if the wall itself has hooked them—then you slap the third warded sheet crosswise over the join.

It catches.

When you press your palm flat and bring the lamp close, the reliquary flame flattens again, heat blooming through the fibers. The three sheets tack together into one continuous “skin.” The ink that had been writing along the join hits the new crosswise warding and stops dead, pooling in a blunt oval. The scratching sound returns for half a second—furious, trapped—then collapses into silence.

Halven exhales through his teeth. “Good. Keep it sealed.”

Senn—still hands over ears, mouth shut—staggers a half-step as if the floor shifted under him. A thin line of blood appears at one nostril. He does not speak.

You lean in to the edge-text. There’s still writing trying to exist, but now it’s trapped under layers—letters pressed flat and reversed, like an insect under glass. You don’t read it aloud. You trace what you *see* into your notebook as nonsense marks.

The moment charcoal touches your notebook page, the marks don’t stay nonsense.

They try to self-correct.

Your copied strokes subtly tug into more legible forms—curves tightening, angles aligning—like the page wants to become a clean transcript. The warding on your notebook paper (if any) isn’t the same as the sheets on the wall; the ink-pressure finds that difference and exploits it. The copied line begins to resemble a phrase, half-formed and mirrored:

**BRI… LAMP… STIT… DOOR…**

Your lamp flickers once—just once—like a blink. The flame remains steady after, but you feel a quick, cold pinprick behind your left eye, as if something has taken note of you *taking note*.

Halven notices the flicker and snaps his gaze to your notebook. “Don’t—” he starts, too late, then lowers his voice. “Eldra. That’s how it gets out. Not through stone. Through *copying*.”

The immediate threat shifts: the wall is sealed for now, but your notebook page is actively being coerced into a readable message. If the text completes into a clear instruction or name, it may become a new “stitched route” anchor—portable, and tied to you and the lamp.

#### Turn 174 **[PLAYER]**

I snap the notebook shut on the half-formed line and bind it with a warded paper strap from my satchel. “No more copying—my fault.”  

I tilt the lamp away and pinch my own left eyelid, testing the pinprick. “Halven, keep pressure on the wall—does it still feel like it’s pushing?”  

Then I crouch to Senn, offering a clean cloth. “Don’t speak—just point: is that pain in your head, your throat, or your chest?”

*Agent reasoning: The message is trying to escape through my notebook; I should stop the transcription and quarantine the page without reading it aloud, while checking on Senn and keeping the wall sealed.*

#### Turn 175 **[GAME]**

You clap the notebook shut before the charcoal line can finish “settling” into legible words. The cover meets the paper with a dull *thump*—and the pinprick behind your left eye answers with a quick pulse, like a needle withdrawing.

You wrap it with a warded paper strap from your satchel and cinch it tight. The strap warms under your fingers as the warding catches; a faint, dry scent of candle wax rises. For a moment the strap’s inked sigils look slightly misprinted—as if something tried to mirror them—then they hold. The notebook goes still. No more tugging at the edges.

You tilt the lamp away and pinch your eyelid. The pain is localized: not an injury, more like pressure behind the eye. When you press, you see a brief afterimage—thin black strokes, like a single word written on the inside of your skull—then it fades before it resolves.

Halven keeps both hands planted on the paper-skin over the mausoleum seam. “It’s not pushing like before,” he says, voice tight with concentration. “It’s… waiting. Like it’s listening for a new gap.” He shifts his weight minutely. “The wall’s cold again. That’s good.”

You crouch to Senn and offer the cloth. He takes it with shaking fingers and dabs his nose, careful not to open his mouth. His eyes flick to Halven, then back to you.

When you ask him to point, he hesitates—then taps two places: first his **throat**, then his **temple**. After a beat he presses two fingers to the hollow above his collarbone, **center chest**, as if indicating the pressure is sinking.

As he points at his throat, the cloth in his hand darkens—not with blood, but with a thin *ink-gray smear* that wasn’t there a second ago, like soot dragged from a page. Senn freezes, staring at it.

Halven sees the smear and immediately lifts one hand *just enough* to grab Senn’s wrist—without releasing the wall entirely. “Don’t wipe it on anything else,” he orders. “That’s how it spreads.”

The threat is now concrete: whatever was trying to “mouth” through the seam has left a residue that’s seeking a new surface—cloth, skin, paper—anything it can mark. If it finds a clean page or an unwarded edge, it may start writing again, this time through Senn.

#### Turn 176 **[PLAYER]**

I snatch another warded sheet and, without touching the smear, fold it around the cloth like a specimen envelope. “Halven—keep him still; I’m bagging the soot.”

I hold the reliquary lamp close to the folded paper until it tacks shut. Then I take Senn’s free hand and press two fingers to his wrist, watching his face. “Blink once if you can still breathe easy through your nose. Twice if it feels like it’s tightening.”

*Agent reasoning: The ink-residue is the immediate danger; I want to contain it without giving it new surfaces, and I’m curious what “word” flashed behind my eye but won’t risk writing it. I’ll use the lamp/warding to trap the smear and check Senn’s breathing silently.*

#### Turn 177 **[GAME]**

You fold the warded sheet around the cloth without letting it brush anything else. The moment the ink-gray smear is enclosed, it behaves like a living stain: it *creeps* toward the nearest crease, searching for an edge.

The warding stops it.

It hits the inner fold and flattens, leaving a sharp, fern-like imprint as if it tried to become a letter and failed. You bring the reliquary lamp close. The flame’s heat tacks the paper shut—fibers tightening, seal-lines knitting. Inside, the smear gives a single faint *scrape* like a quill dragged across bone, then goes quiet.

Halven keeps Senn pinned with one forearm while maintaining pressure on the wall with the other hand and his shoulder. “Still,” he says to Senn through clenched teeth. To you, lower: “Good. Don’t open that again.”

You take Senn’s free hand and check his wrist. His pulse is fast and a little uneven—he flinches at your touch, not from pain but from a reflexive fear of contact. His skin is cold-damp.

You ask for blinks.

Senn stares at you hard, then blinks **twice**—deliberate, strained. After the second blink, his nostrils flare as if he’s forcing air through a narrowing passage. He presses his tongue against the inside of his closed lips, panic rising in his eyes.

Halven’s head snaps toward Senn’s face. “Throat’s tightening,” he says, immediate and practical. He shifts his grip to keep Senn’s chin slightly up, trying to keep the airway open without making him speak. “If he coughs, it’ll try to *write out* through breath.”

At the sealed wall, under Halven’s braced shoulder, you feel (more than hear) a soft *tap…tap…tap*—not pushing, not scratching. A patient, rhythmic knock from the other side, as if something has learned you respond to signals.

The immediate threats are now twofold and clear:
1) Senn’s airway is tightening; if it escalates into coughing or choking, whatever’s in him may attempt to externalize as ink-breath or spoken script.
2) The thing behind the wall has stopped forcing and started communicating—testing for a response, a pattern, a “reply.”

#### Turn 178 **[PLAYER]**

I turn my body to block Senn’s view of the wall and raise my lamp between him and the seam like a small sun. “Senn—eyes on the flame. Match me: in through the nose, out through the nose,” I demonstrate slow, steady breaths with my lips sealed, then press my thumb gently at the soft spot above his collarbone to cue his throat to relax.

To Halven, in a low hiss: “Do not answer the tapping—no rhythm back.” I edge a spare warded sheet under Halven’s elbow as a buffer and whisper, “If he has to cough, I’m sealing his mouth with paper—tell me now if that’ll make it worse.”

*Agent reasoning: Senn’s airway is the urgent problem; I need a nonverbal, non-writing way to ease it, while refusing the wall’s “conversation” so it can’t latch onto a pattern.*

#### Turn 179 **[GAME]**

You step between Senn and the seam, and the effect is immediate: his eyes stop darting to the wall and lock onto your lamp’s steady flame. The reliquary light doesn’t “burn” the air, but it makes the ink-dark corners retreat into ordinary shadow.

You demonstrate: lips sealed, slow inhale through the nose, slow exhale through the nose. Senn tries to match you. The first breath catches halfway in—his nostrils flare, panic spikes—then you press your thumb into the soft hollow above his collarbone.

His shoulders drop a fraction.

On the next inhale he gets more air. Not comfortable, but possible. He exhales through his nose in a thin stream. His pulse under your fingers stays fast, but the erratic flutter smooths into a rapid, steadier beat.

Behind you, the tapping at the seam continues for three beats… then stops, as if it noticed you refused to “converse.”

Halven nods once at your warning, jaw clenched. He does not answer the wall with any movement beyond holding pressure. When you edge the spare warded sheet under his elbow, it slides into place with a papery rasp. The wall’s cold seeps into it; the sheet’s warding takes, turning the edge-text on the paper slightly darker, like it’s drinking chill.

Halven whispers back, careful not to shape the words toward the seam. “If he coughs, don’t seal his mouth shut.” His eyes flick to Senn’s throat. “It’ll trap the pressure and force it to write somewhere else—eyes, ears, skin. Better to give it one clean place it can’t mark.”

As if to prove the point, a thin thread of ink-gray appears at the corner of Senn’s right nostril—barely a smear, like soot caught in sweat. It doesn’t drip; it *tests* the edge, then retracts when it meets the lamp’s light.

Senn blinks hard and raises two fingers toward his nose, asking silently if he should wipe. Halven catches his wrist before he can touch his face.

Threat, now explicit: Senn is stabilizing, but the “script” is probing for an exit through nostrils/skin contact. If anyone wipes it onto cloth, paper, or the wall-sheet, it may gain a new surface to continue writing—or jump hosts.

#### Turn 180 **[PLAYER]**

I keep the lamp steady on Senn’s face and gently take his raised fingers, guiding his hand down. “No wiping—just breathe with me.”

I pull a fresh warded sheet and fold it into a stiff little nose-guard/funnel without touching him, then hold it a finger’s width under his nostrils to catch anything that tries to drip—never letting it touch skin. To Halven, quiet: “Does the lamp’s light *repel* it, or just make it hide—what did you see last time this happened?”

*Agent reasoning: The ink is testing exits via Senn’s nose and any wiping could spread it; I want to contain it without giving it a writable surface, and also learn what the lamp is doing to it.*

#### Turn 181 **[GAME]**

You guide Senn’s fingers down before they can reach his face. He resists for half a heartbeat—instinct screaming to wipe—then yields and fixes on the flame again. He keeps breathing with you: in through the nose, out through the nose, shallow but controlled.

You fold the fresh warded sheet into a stiff little funnel and hold it just beneath his nostrils, leaving a careful gap so it never touches skin.

On Senn’s next exhale, a faint mist of damp breath hits the paper. For a second, nothing else happens.

Then the ink-gray at the edge of his right nostril *threads outward*—not a drip, a filament—reaching for the nearest surface like a spiderline. It stretches, quivers… and touches the warded paper’s inner lip.

The moment it contacts the warding, it snaps flat into a tiny, starburst blot, as if it struck glass. A hair-thin line tries to continue, forming the first stroke of a letter—then the warding “catches” and the line breaks into harmless grit.

Senn’s eyes widen at the sensation of something leaving him. His next inhale is deeper—still tight, but less desperate. He blinks once, then holds your gaze, silently asking if that was good.

Halven watches the paper-funnel with a grim, almost relieved focus. At your question, he answers without looking away from Senn’s face. “It hides from the light—until it thinks it has a surface it can *keep*.” He swallows. “Last time it didn’t fight the flame. It waited for a cough and took the inside of a man’s sleeve. Wrote three words before we burned the cloth. The words were… instructions.”

As he says “instructions,” the seam behind your shoulder gives a single soft *tap*—not rhythmic, just one. Like a punctuation mark.

Halven stiffens. “It learns.”

Right now, your improvised nose-guard is working: it’s catching the escaping soot-script and forcing it to fail on warding. But it also gives the thing a consistent “target” to test—if your grip slips and the paper touches Senn’s skin, it may bridge from host to page in a more stable way.

#### Turn 182 **[PLAYER]**

I keep the funnel steady but shift it onto a quick little paper “stand” on the floor—two folded warded sheets like a cradle—so it can sit under Senn’s nostrils without my hand shaking or drifting into his skin. “Senn, stay very still—keep breathing, you’re doing it right.”

To Halven, barely a whisper: “What were the three words it wrote last time—exactly?” Then I glance over my shoulder at the seam without moving my feet and murmur, “And can you feel any warm spots or bulges through the patch, or is it staying flat-cold?”

*Agent reasoning: The warded funnel is helping but risky if it touches Senn; I want a safer catch method and to learn what the “instructions” were, while also checking the seam without engaging its taps.*

#### Turn 183 **[GAME]**

You build the cradle fast: two warded sheets folded into stiff tents, their creases aligned so the ward-text sits “upright.” You set the funnel atop them and slide the little stand into position under Senn’s nose.

It works—but not cleanly.

As the stand crosses the stone, the necropolis floor’s ink-slick damp grabs at the bottom edge. One corner of the cradle drinks in a smear of black moisture. The warding holds, but the wet spot blooms into a faint halo of cramped, illegible micro-script—like the floor tried to annotate your paper and failed to find a grammar.

Senn stays still. He breathes. On his next exhale, another filament of soot-script reaches down, touches the funnel, and again collapses into grit against the warding. The grit skitters, dry and pepper-fine, collecting in the fold like dead ash.

Halven answers your first question with a hard look that says *don’t make me say it*—then he does, because you asked for exactness.

“**OPEN. THE. LAMP.**” he whispers, each word clipped and forced through his teeth, careful not to project toward the seam. “It wrote it on wool. We burned the sleeve. The man lived. He never stopped smelling ink.”

At “lamp,” your reliquary flame gutters once—just a brief stutter, like someone pinched the wick from very far away—then steadies. Senn flinches at the flicker but keeps breathing.

You glance over your shoulder without moving your feet. Halven shifts his weight minutely and tests the patched seam with his forearm and shoulder.

“Flat-cold,” he murmurs. “No bulge. No give. But—” He pauses, listening with his bones rather than his ears. “Pressure changes when it taps. Like it’s right there, then not.”

From the seam comes a new sound: not tapping—*a slow drag*, as if a fingernail is tracing the edge of your patch. The patch itself doesn’t move, but the warded buffer sheet under Halven’s elbow darkens another shade along its margin, as though it’s being read.

Threat, now immediate and specific: whatever is behind the stitched door has stopped testing for a reply and started *studying your warding and your lamp-word*. It may be trying to provoke you into opening the lamp, or to find a way to “write through” the paper stand you’ve placed on the damp stone.

#### Turn 184 **[PLAYER]**

I slide my satchel under the paper cradle to lift it off the ink-slick stone, then nudge the damp-touched corner into the lamp’s light until it dries and stops blooming script. “Senn, keep breathing—good, good—eyes on the flame.”

Without repeating the phrase, I murmur to Halven, “It’s baiting the lamp—don’t even think the words,” and I carefully lay a blank (unwritten) sheet over the darkening buffer by his elbow like a sacrificial cover. Then I lean close to the seam—silent—and tilt the lamp so its light washes the patch, watching for any place the “reading” concentrates or the stitching twitches.

*Agent reasoning: The floor damp is trying to “annotate” my paper stand, so I need to get the warded setup off the stone and reduce surfaces it can read. The seam is studying the warding and baiting “OPEN THE LAMP,” so I’ll avoid speaking that phrase again and strengthen the patch without giving it new text. Also keep Senn breathing and catching soot safely.*

#### Turn 185 **[GAME]**

You slide your satchel under the paper cradle and lift it clean off the ink-slick stone. The damp-touched corner comes with it—no longer feeding on floor-wet—and when you angle it into the lamp’s glow, the cramped micro-script halo pales, then dries into a faint, scorched-looking watermark. It stops trying to “bloom.” The pepper-fine grit in the funnel stays inert.

Senn keeps breathing. His nostrils flare less on each inhale. The soot at the edge of his right nostril thins from a visible smudge to a dull shadow, as if whatever’s inside him is losing purchase when it can’t find a friendly surface. He nods once, tiny, eyes locked on the flame like it’s a metronome.

Halven’s jaw tightens at your warning. He doesn’t answer—just shifts his gaze away from your lamp, as if even looking at it feels like “thinking near” the bait.

You lay a blank sheet over the darkening buffer by his elbow. The effect is immediate and ugly: the darkening stops on the buffer beneath, but the new blank sheet starts to take it instead—its fibers drinking cold and turning gray along the edge closest to the seam. A faint indentation appears in the paper, as though invisible type is pressing from the other side. Not ink, not yet—pressure.

Then you lean in, silent, and wash the patch in lamplight.

The stitches react.

Three threads on the lower left of the patch twitch in sequence—one, two, three—like a patient finger-tap answered in thread. In the lamp’s wash you see the twitches aren’t random: they’re concentrated around a knot that wasn’t there a moment ago, a tiny puckered “eye” in the stitching that seems to drink the light rather than reflect it.

At the same time, the sacrificial blank sheet under Halven’s elbow creases by itself, forming a shallow fold that points directly at that knot—like an arrow made of paper memory.

From behind the seam comes a sound you can’t mistake now: a muffled inhale, slow and close, as if someone is breathing against cloth. The patch stays flat-cold under Halven’s pressure, but the breathing continues—testing the boundary without bulging it.

Threat, clear: the thing behind the stitched door has found a focal point (“the eye-knot”) where it can interact—reading by pressure, twitching stitches, and possibly preparing to puncture or “write through” if given enough light and blank surface.

I snatch the “sacrificial” blank sheet away from Halven’s elbow and crumple it tight in my fist, then tuck it into a sealed pocket of my satchel—no more clean pages near that seam. “Halven—keep pressure, but shift your elbow off the buffer; I think it’s using the paper like a tongue.”

I tilt the lamp away so the patch falls into dimmer, indirect light, then take a pre-warded sheet and press it flat over the eye-knot without rubbing—just a firm, steady palm through the paper. In a hush I ask the seam, “Can you *hear* without writing—yes or no?” and immediately bite my tongue, glaring at myself for giving it anything at all.

*Agent reasoning: The “eye-knot” is a weak point reacting to light and blank paper; I want to map its behavior without feeding it, and protect Halven/Senn by removing writable surfaces and adding warding pressure.*

#### Turn 187 **[GAME]**

You yank the blank sheet away. The moment it leaves the seam’s “reach,” the gray pressure-indentation vanishes from its surface—like a hand pulled back through a wall. You crumple it tight; the creases grind the faint imprint into nothing readable. When you stuff it into the sealed pocket, the paper inside your satchel gives a single, dry *tick*—as if something tried to follow and hit the seal instead.

Halven shifts exactly as told: he keeps his shoulder braced to the patch but slides his elbow off the buffer. The darkening on the buffer stops spreading immediately. He exhales once, controlled, and doesn’t look at your lamp.

You tilt the lamp away. The patch drops into dim, indirect light; the twitching threads go still. The “eye-knot” remains—puckered, wrong—but less active without the direct wash.

Then you press a pre-warded sheet over the eye-knot with a firm, steady palm.

Contact triggers a reaction anyway.

Under your hand, the knot tightens as if it’s trying to bite down on the paper. You feel a faint tug—not enough to pull the sheet away, but enough to confirm there’s *traction* there. A hairline of cold creeps into your palm through the paper, like holding winter by a glove.

When you whisper, “Can you hear without writing—yes or no?” the seam answers without words.

The stitched threads beneath your warded sheet begin to move in a deliberate pattern: two short tugs, then a long one—like a practiced signal. Your warding doesn’t let ink through, but the pressure comes through cleanly, telegraphing intent.

Halven’s eyes flick to your hand. “Moth—off. Now.” He doesn’t shout, but his voice turns sharp with fear. “It’s answering. That’s not—”

Senn inhales too fast, panic breaking his rhythm for the first time. A dark bead of soot gathers at the edge of his nostril, swelling as if encouraged by the exchange. It doesn’t fall—yet—but it’s *back*.

The threat is immediate and specific: the entity can’t write through your warding, but it **can communicate by pressure and stitch-movement**, and your question has given it a call-and-response channel. Each “answer” coincides with Senn’s soot-script reasserting itself—suggesting the thing is using him as a reservoir while it negotiates at the seam.

I jerk my hand off the warded sheet and peel it away from the eye-knot in one clean motion, then fold it inward on itself twice and clamp it shut with my thumb—no exposed face toward the seam. “No more questions,” I mutter, more to me than anyone, and angle my body to block Senn’s view again.

I bring the lamp back to Senn’s face—steady, close. “Eyes here. In—out—slow,” and I tap my own sternum to set the pace, keeping the paper funnel under his nose on the satchel-stand to catch the bead if it drops.

To Halven, low and urgent: “If it answers by stitches, can we jam it—wrap the knot tight, add more thread, wax, anything? Or do we back away and let the patch go dead-cold again?”

*Agent reasoning: I accidentally opened a communication channel and it’s feeding back into Senn; I need to break contact fast, re-stabilize his breathing, and deny the seam any surfaces or attention while we regroup.*

#### Turn 190 **[PLAYER]**

I jerk my hand off the warded sheet and peel it away from the eye-knot in one clean motion, then fold it inward twice and pinch it shut—no face toward the seam. “No more questions,” I mutter, and shift my shoulder to block Senn’s view of the patch.

I bring the lamp back close to Senn’s face. “Eyes here—breathe with me. In… out… slow,” tapping my sternum to set the pace, keeping the funnel on the satchel-stand under his nose.

To Halven, low and urgent: “If it answers by stitches, can we jam it—tighten the knot, add thread, wax—anything? Or do we back away and let the patch go dead-cold again?”

*Agent reasoning: The seam started “answering” and it flared Senn’s soot back up; I need to cut the interaction, re-stabilize Senn’s breathing with the lamp, and ask Halven for the safest way to neutralize the eye-knot without feeding it more clean paper/light.*

#### Turn 191 **[GAME]**

You peel the warded sheet off the eye-knot in one clean pull. The instant the paper breaks contact, the knot loosens a fraction—like a jaw unclenching. No ink follows. No new pressure-letters appear. Folding it inward twice and pinching it shut works: the sheet stays inert in your grip, and the seam gives no immediate “answer” to the movement.

When you shift to block Senn’s view, his eyes—wide and glassy—lose the patch and find your lamp instead. You bring the flame close, steady. Your sternum-tap sets a rhythm he can copy.

It helps. His shoulders drop a hair. He draws in—slow—then lets it out. On the second exhale the soot-bead at his nostril swells, trembles, and finally drops.

It doesn’t fall like liquid. It *unthreads* in midair into a thin black filament, trying to climb back toward his nose.

The paper funnel catches it.

The filament hits the funnel’s rim, twitches once like a hooked worm, and then goes slack, collapsing into a small, glossy knot of soot-script at the bottom of the funnel. The air immediately smells sharper—iron and burnt paper—like a page singed at the edges.

Senn coughs once, dry, then inhales cleanly. “It—left,” he whispers, shocked. His right nostril is stained but no longer bulging with that living dark.

Halven doesn’t relax. He keeps his braced shoulder on the patch, but he leans toward you just enough to speak without turning his head.

“Jamming is a wager,” he says, voice tight. “Wax and extra thread give it *more material* to work with. Tightening a knot can turn it into a puncture point—like pulling a noose until it cuts through cloth.” He swallows. “Backing away and starving it of light and clean surface is safer—unless it’s already anchored.”

As he says “anchored,” the patch proves him half-wrong: even in dimmer light, the eye-knot gives a small, deliberate *twitch*—a single tug—aimed toward your satchel stand and the funnel.

The threat is now specific and present: whatever is behind the seam has shifted interest from “answering” to **the captured soot-knot**—and it can still signal through the stitching without direct lamplight.

#### Turn 192 **[PLAYER]**

I slide the funnel off the satchel-stand and quickly cap it with a pre-warded sheet, folding and sealing it into a tight paper packet around the soot-knot. “Mine,” I whisper, then tuck the packet deep into my satchel between warded pages, away from the seam.

To Halven: “Back away—slow—keep your body between it and us; I don’t want it ‘watching’ the satchel.” Then to Senn, softer: “You did it. Keep breathing—can you walk?” 

As we start to withdraw, I angle the lamp down toward the floor rather than the patch, and murmur to Halven, “If it’s anchored, where—stitches, stone, or Senn? What do you think it wants the knot for?”

*Agent reasoning: The seam’s focusing on the captured soot-knot; I want to secure the sample fast, starve the seam, and also inspect what we caught without feeding it more clean surfaces.*

#### Turn 193 **[GAME]**

You slide the funnel free and cap it with a pre-warded sheet. The moment paper meets paper, the soot-knot inside gives a single, frantic *scrape*—like a pencil tip dragged across the inside of a box—then falls quiet. You fold, fold, seal: a tight packet with no exposed opening. When you whisper “Mine,” nothing answers aloud, but the seam’s eye-knot pulls once—hard enough to make the patched cloth dimple inward—then releases.

You tuck the packet deep between warded pages. The satchel’s wards take it: the air around the flap cools, and the faint iron-burnt smell dulls as if smothered.

Halven nods once and starts the withdrawal exactly as you asked: slow steps, shoulder still toward the patch, his body a moving barricade. He keeps his ink-buffer between his palm and the cloth now, not trusting bare contact. “Don’t run,” he murmurs, more command than comfort.

Senn swallows, nods, and tests his legs. He can walk—unsteady but upright. “I can—yes. Just—don’t let me look at it.” He keeps his gaze on your lamp’s pool on the stone floor.

You angle the lamp down. The patch loses its direct feed of attention and light. For three steps, it stays merely wrong and quiet.

Then the seam reacts to the retreat.

A thin black stitch-filament—no thicker than hair—pushes out from the eye-knot and lays itself along the floor, *seeking* like a feeler. It doesn’t chase fast; it probes, tracing the direction your satchel moved, pausing when it meets a crack in the stone as if tasting it.

Halven answers your question without looking back. “Anchored in the stitching,” he says. “Stone is just a page it can write on. Senn was a wick—used, not rooted.” His voice goes flatter on the last part. “It wants the knot because it’s *its own ink returned.* If it gets it back, it can spool more. If it loses it… it has to bargain, or starve.”

As you withdraw another step, the probing filament reaches the edge of your lamp’s downcast light and recoils, not burned—*repelled*, like it recognizes Concord flame and doesn’t want to be seen in it.

The immediate threat is clear: the seam can extend **searching stitch-filaments** along surfaces to track or retrieve the packet, and it’s testing the floor for a route around Halven’s body-shield.

#### Turn 194 **[PLAYER]**

I widen the lamp’s pool on the floor with a slow sweep, “painting” a brighter ring between us and the filament, then scuff my boot across a few cracks to smear our trail. “Halven, keep backing—stay in the light. Senn, eyes down, hand on my sleeve.”

As we move, I flick a pinch of grit from the satchel (not a clean page—just dirt) into a different crack off to the side. “Go sniff that,” I mutter under my breath, then to Halven: “If light repels it, can we mark a corridor—lanterns, chalk, anything reflective—until we find a door that isn’t stitched?”

*Agent reasoning: The stitch-filament is probing along cracks and recoils from the lamp’s edge; I want to test that boundary and confuse its tracking while keeping Senn moving.*

#### Turn 195 **[GAME]**

You sweep the lamp low and wide, brightening the floor into a broader, steadier pool. The stitch-filament hits the edge of that light and flinches back again—more sharply this time—curling toward the patch as if retracting a tongue. It doesn’t vanish, but it stops advancing while the light stays on it.

Your boot scuffs across the cracks you’d stepped over. Grit and damp lichen smear into the seams of stone, breaking the clean “line” the filament had been following. The probing thread pauses, taps the smeared crack twice, then veers—uncertain.

Senn obeys immediately: eyes down, one hand tight on your sleeve like a child crossing ice. He keeps breathing in your pace, quieter now. “I’m here,” he whispers, as if saying it keeps him real.

You flick a pinch of plain dirt into a different crack off to the side.

The filament reacts—fast. It darts toward that crack in a sudden, eager slide, as if the grit carries your scent. It slips into the fissure and goes still.

For a heartbeat, it looks like the decoy worked.

Then the crack *answers*: a second, thinner line of black stitch rises from the fissure a few feet farther along—one you didn’t see before—like the floor had been pre-threaded. It angles toward your retreat, testing the edge of the lamp’s widened pool.

Halven swears under his breath. He keeps backing, staying in your light as ordered, but he changes his stance: he turns his cloak outward and spreads it slightly, trying to make himself a larger moving barrier between the floor-thread and your satchel. “Corridor marking helps,” he says, voice clipped. “But lanterns mean scrutiny. Chalk works until damp eats it. Reflective—mirrors, mica, polished grave-tiles—can extend your lamp without more flames.”

He glances down at the new filament and adds, “It’s learning. Or it already had more than one anchor.”

The threat is now twofold and concrete: **multiple stitch-anchors** can emerge from cracks and seams, and your decoy dirt can trigger movement—meaning the floor itself may be laced with dormant “listening” threads that wake when fed anything that carries you.

No new pages are seized, but you can hear bootsteps somewhere beyond the next bend—measured, clerical—too steady to be mourners. Warden pace.

#### Turn 196 **[PLAYER]**

I freeze us for half a breath and sweep the lamp in a firm arc to pin both filaments at the very edge of light, then tug Halven’s sleeve and whisper, “Up—bench, plinth, anything not cracked stone,” guiding Senn with me onto the nearest raised surface.

Low, to Halven: “Wardens coming—do we trust them with ‘stitched seams’, or do we go quiet and let them pass?” I glance toward the bend, then add, “If you’ve got any mica or polished scrap, hand it over—I'll angle the lamp off it and keep a bright fence without showing the flame.”

*Agent reasoning: Wardens nearby could complicate everything, but they might also have tools like mica, mirrors, or chalk; I want to avoid the floor threads by getting off the cracks and keep the lamp controlling the filament while we decide whether to hide or intercept.*

#### Turn 197 **[GAME]**

You freeze. The lamp swings in a firm, low arc.

Both stitch-filaments react the same way: they stop at the light’s edge as if snagged on an invisible wire. One curls back into its crack; the other flattens against the stone, trembling, unwilling to cross. The “bright fence” works—so long as you keep it steady and close.

You tug Halven and guide Senn up onto the nearest raised surface: a low sarcophagus plinth with a chipped marble lip. It’s cleaner than the floor—fewer cracks, fewer seams to hide in. Senn clambers up awkwardly, nearly slipping, but your grip on his sleeve keeps him upright. Halven steps up last, never turning his back to the floor-thread.

Below you, the filaments probe the base of the plinth, searching for a join. One finds a hairline fracture in the marble and tries to slip into it—then recoils when your lamp’s light pools there. It can’t climb into the lighted fracture, but it’s clearly *looking* for a way onto the raised stone.

From the bend ahead: bootsteps resolve into two sets, then three. Ink-caps. Chain of keys. A soft scrape of a lantern hook.

Halven leans close, voice barely above breath. “We don’t trust them with this,” he says. “Not the wrong wardens. They’ll seize your lamp and call it ‘unsafe illumination.’ And if they see Senn’s staining, they’ll quarantine him and write him into custody.”

He digs into his sleeve-cuff and produces a thin, thumb-sized shard of mica wrapped in wax paper—likely a page-protector turned to other use. He presses it into your palm. “Angle it. Keep the flame down. No direct glare.”

As he speaks, one of the approaching wardens calls around the corner, not yet seeing you: “Curfew audit. Lamps down and satchels open. Concord writ.”

The stitch-filaments below twitch at the sound, then go still—as if listening too.

**Threats, immediate and concrete:**
- The seam-thing is actively searching for a path onto the plinth via fractures and joins.
- Three Warden-Scribes are seconds away from line-of-sight; if they spot your lamp and satchel, they will attempt confiscation under curfew authority.

#### Turn 198 **[PLAYER]**

I wrap the mica in my fingers and tilt the lamp down behind the sarcophagus lip, bouncing a hard, pale strip of light off the mica to “paint” the hairline fracture and the plinth’s base—no direct flame showing. I pull Senn down into a crouch and whisper, “Hold your breath when they pass—just a moment,” then tuck my satchel under my knee.

In a low, steady voice toward the bend (without stepping out), I call, “Audit—under whose seal? We’re sheltering from a seam-fault in the floor; you’ll want a mirror-lamp, not keys.”

*Agent reasoning: Wardens will confiscate and expose Senn; I need to stay unseen while keeping the stitch-filaments pinned. Using mica lets me redirect light as a low, indirect fence, and the sarcophagus offers concealment. I’ll also probe the wardens’ intent with a harmless-sounding call without revealing the satchel.*

#### Turn 199 **[GAME]**

You cup the mica and drop the lamp behind the sarcophagus lip. The flame itself disappears from any straight line to the corridor, but the mica throws a hard, pallid ribbon of light down the plinth’s base like a blade laid on stone.

At once, the hairline fracture brightens—every tiny tooth of it outlined. The stitch-filament that had been nosing for purchase hits that lit seam and recoils, snapping back into the floor crack with a wet, threadlike *zip*. The other filament flattens and retreats a handspan, as if the reflected light is less “authority” than the open flame but still too exposing to cross.

Senn folds into a crouch, both hands clamped over his own mouth. His chest stills. You feel the tremor of him through your sleeve, but he holds.

Your satchel goes under your knee. The wards on it give a faint, papery resistance, like pressing down on a closed book that wants to spring open.

Your call carries around the bend. The bootsteps halt. Keys chime once, then stop.

A Warden-Scribe’s voice answers—male, controlled, trained to sound like a door closing. “Seal of Third Candle, Curfew Writ Seventeen. Step into view. Lamp and satchel visible. Now.”

A second voice—older, impatient—adds, “Mirror-lamps are contraband outside sanctioned copying rooms. You just confessed to one.”

They don’t rush you. Instead, lantern light lifts slowly on the far wall as they angle their own hooded lanterns to avoid giving you a bright target. You catch the edge of a Concord sigil on a sleeve as one leans, trying to get a sightline without fully rounding the corner.

Halven’s breath goes tight beside you. He doesn’t speak, but his posture changes: he shifts so his body blocks Senn from any direct view down the corridor.

On the floor below, the stitch-filaments go unnaturally still—then begin to slide sideways, away from your painted fracture, toward the darker side of the plinth where your reflected strip doesn’t reach. They’re not advancing at you; they’re repositioning, searching for an unlit join.

**What’s happening, plainly:**
- Your mica-reflected light successfully drives the filament out of the plinth’s hairline fracture and keeps the base “fenced” where you paint it.
- Your call stops the wardens and draws scrutiny; they now suspect you of contraband illumination and are ordering you into view.
- The seam-thing is adapting, shifting to the unlit side of the plinth to find another way up.

#### Turn 200 **[PLAYER]**

I keep the lamp hidden and slide the mica’s pale strip around to the plinth’s darker side, “painting” the base in a slow sweep to deny the filaments a shadowed seam. Without stepping out, I call, “Third Candle then—you know what a live seam does to a writ. I’ll show hands and lamp-shade only; satchel stays shut unless your seal-bearer swears a binding against seizure and contamination.”

I press my elbow lightly into Halven’s side as a cue to stay blocking Senn, and add, quieter but firm, “And send one warden forward with a hooded lantern—no keys, no crossing the cracks—unless you want to explain to your Archivist why the floor started stitching back.”

*Agent reasoning: Wardens will confiscate if we comply, but refusing escalates; I’ll negotiate using their fear of “seam-faults,” keep Senn hidden, and keep the light-fence moving to stop the stitch-filaments from finding a dark join.*

#### Turn 201 **[GAME]**

You rotate the mica and “walk” the pale strip of reflected light around the plinth’s base. The seam-filaments below respond immediately: each time one finds a darker join, your light catches it and it snaps back, skittering along the floor cracks like a needle searching for cloth it can bite. For the moment, neither filament manages to climb—your moving fence denies them a stable shadowed seam.

Your terms carry around the bend.

There’s a pause long enough to hear the wardens’ lantern oil whisper.

Then the controlled voice answers, colder. “You don’t dictate bindings to the Concord from behind a tomb.”

A third voice—female, younger, precise—cuts in with professional interest rather than anger: “Live seam? Describe it. Thread? Soot-script? Where’s the anchor?”

Keys jingle again; someone takes them off a belt and holds them still. You hear leather creak as a lantern is hooded further.

One warden steps into partial view at the corner—careful, as you demanded. Hooded lantern held high, light down-angled to avoid spilling into cracks. No keys visible. His free hand is open, showing empty palm. He doesn’t cross into the corridor fully; he plants his boot on a relatively unbroken flagstone and tests the next step with the lantern’s rim like a blind cane.

“I’m Seal-bearer Lute,” he says. A brass plate at his chest catches a sliver of his own lantern glow. “Hands first. Lamp-shade only. Satchel stays shut—for now.”

Behind him, the older impatient warden mutters, “This is how smugglers talk,” but he doesn’t advance.

Your mention of “the Archivist” changes their tempo. The seal-bearer’s shoulders tighten; he’s weighing bureaucratic fallout against curfew authority.

Below your plinth, the filaments stop retreating and do something worse: they sink into separate cracks and go slack, as if playing dead. A heartbeat later, a *new* thin line—fainter, almost hair-dust—begins to rise along the vertical edge of the plinth where marble meets mortar, directly beneath the sarcophagus lip. It’s using a join you can’t fully paint without exposing your lamp’s position.

Threat, clear and immediate: **a third seam-thread is climbing the plinth’s vertical join, inside the “blind spot” of your reflected strip**, and the seal-bearer is now close enough that any sudden flare of open flame or visible contraband will be seen.

#### Turn 202 **[PLAYER]**

I raise both hands into the seal-bearer’s sightline, fingers spread, keeping my lamp hidden behind the sarcophagus lip. “Hands shown. Lamp is hooded and down—no open flame.”

Without moving my torso much, I slide a warded sheet from my satchel with my knee and, still crouched, press its edge firmly along the plinth’s mortar join under the lip—like blotting a spill—then drag it a slow inch upward to catch the climbing hair-thread. Toward the younger voice, quick and precise: “Yes—thread and soot-script. Anchor is the satchel seam; it probes cracks to climb. It recoils from Concord light and reflected glare. Do not cross cracked stone and do not bring keys near it.”

*Agent reasoning: The new thread is climbing in a blind spot; I need to stop it without revealing the flame. I’ll comply partially with the seal-bearer to keep him cooperative, while using my body and a warded page to physically block/strip the climbing thread. Also I’ll feed the curious younger warden a clear description to buy time and authority.*

#### Turn 204 **[PLAYER]**

I lift both hands into the seal-bearer’s view, fingers spread. “Hands shown—lamp is hooded and down, no open flame.”

Staying crouched, I work a warded sheet out with my knee and press it hard along the mortar join under the sarcophagus lip, blotting and then dragging it a slow inch upward to snag the climbing hair-thread. Toward the younger warden’s voice I say, quick and clipped: “Thread and soot-script—anchor’s in the floor cracks and it climbs seams. It recoils from Concord light and reflected glare; don’t cross cracked stone and keep keys away from it.”

*Agent reasoning: I need to keep the wardens calm while I deal with the climbing hair-thread in the blind spot; I’ll show compliance with hands, keep the lamp concealed, and use a warded sheet to “catch” the thread without flaring light.*

#### Turn 205 **[GAME]**

Your hands rise into the corner’s sightline, fingers spread. Seal-bearer Lute answers by lifting his own empty hand higher in acknowledgment—then he shifts his hooded lantern a fraction, trying to catch the outline of your “hooded and down” lamp without flooding the floor.

He can’t see the lamp. He can see your hands.

With your knee you ease a warded sheet free. The moment the paper’s edge touches the mortar join under the sarcophagus lip, it *catches*—not like snagging on grit, but like a magnet finding a pin. The climbing hair-thread is there.

You press. The warding takes: the paper drinks the thread’s sheen. A faint, tight line of soot-script crawls across the sheet’s edge, then stops as if hitting a border it can’t cross. When you drag the sheet upward that slow inch, the hair-thread comes with it—stretching, thinning—until it gives with a tiny sound like a stitch being pulled through skin.

The severed end snaps back down into the join and vanishes.

Immediate outcome: **you successfully snag and tear the climbing seam-thread off the plinth’s vertical join, and part of it is now adhered to your warded sheet as inert soot-script.**

But the anchor below reacts. From the floor cracks at the plinth’s base, the “playing dead” filaments tense and slide—fast now, not probing—toward the corner where Lute stands. They’re not climbing the plinth anymore; they’re *redirecting*, as if your warded paper taught them this seam is hostile.

Lute sees the movement: a thin dark line skimming along a crack toward his boot.

He jerks his foot back onto the safer flagstone he tested earlier and barks, “Hold—DON’T STEP.”

Behind him, the older warden’s keys clink once in reflex. The younger voice snaps, sharp: “Stop moving the keys!”

At the single key-chime, the crack-line twitches toward the sound like a hooked fish. The filament doesn’t leap out, but it accelerates along the crack, angling for the metal.

Threat, clear: **the seam-filaments are now actively homing on metal noise—keys—and are closing on the wardens’ position via the floor cracks.** If a boot crosses a cracked stone or keys jingle again, the filament has a clear path to latch.

#### Turn 206 **[PLAYER]**

“Keys in cloth. Now—wrap them, no clinking,” I hiss toward the bend, then to Lute, “Don’t backstep across any crack—freeze on that solid flag.”

Keeping my hands visible, I angle the mica’s reflected strip down the crack-line toward the corner to ‘paint’ its path and make it recoil, and I flick the warded sheet off the plinth like a little bridge-tab, pressing its clean edge flat over the crack between the filament and the keys. “You—scribe,” I call to the younger voice, “have you seen seams home on metal before, or is this new?”

*Agent reasoning: The seam is homing on metal sound; I should stop the keys, warn them, and use reflected light/warded paper to divert or pin the filament without exposing the lamp. Also I want to keep questioning the wardens—especially the younger one—about what they know of live seams.*

#### Turn 207 **[GAME]**

Your hissed order lands before the next reflexive jingle can happen.

From behind Lute, there’s a hurried scuff on stone and the sound of cloth being yanked—someone stuffs the keyring into a sleeve or kerchief. The older warden snarls something under his breath, but the metal noise dies to a muffled, soft thud.

Lute obeys your second instruction exactly: he freezes on the intact flagstone, knees bent, lantern still hooded and held high. His eyes don’t leave the crack at his toes.

You tilt the mica. The reflected strip drops cleanly into the crack-line like poured milk. The filament reacts at once: the dark line flattens, then *withdraws* a finger’s breadth, shivering along the fissure as if the light were a fingertip pressing it back.

You flick the warded sheet down as a bridge-tab and pin its clean edge over the crack between the filament’s tip and where the keys were. The paper adheres with a faint tacky pull—warding taking hold. The filament tests the paper’s edge, touches it, and recoils sharply, retreating another few inches down the crack. It doesn’t dissolve, but it can’t cross the warded barrier.

Outcome, plain: **you force the seam-filament to back off with reflected glare and successfully block its approach with the warded sheet. The wardens’ keys stop drawing it once muffled.**

The younger voice answers you from the bend; you hear her step once—carefully—then stop. “This is new,” she says, clipped and certain. “Seams home on *heat* and *ink*, not metal. Unless—” She swallows the rest, then calls to Lute: “Seal-bearer, that’s not a normal seam. That’s a *finder-stitch*. Someone trained it.”

Lute’s jaw tightens. He doesn’t argue; he shifts his hooded lantern a fraction toward the warded sheet, not to burn brighter but to see its placement. “Quillwhisper,” he says, voice low now, “keep that reflection on it. Don’t let it slip past your paper.”

Consequence emerging: the filament’s retreat isn’t random—it’s rerouting. You can see the crack-line’s dark tip angle away from the warded sheet, searching for another branch in the stonework. **Threat:** if it finds an unblocked side-crack that leads around your paper (or if your reflected strip wavers), it can come at the wardens from a different seam—and you’ll have less warning.

#### Turn 208 **[PLAYER]**

“Finder-stitch,” I echo, tasting the term. “Trained by who—Concord, Archivist, or a private hand? What does it *find*—ink, names, blood?”

I keep the mica’s strip steady on the main crack, then, without lifting my torso into view, I tear a narrow ribbon from another warded sheet in my satchel and slide it out along the floor with two fingers, aiming to lay it across the nearest branching hairline like a second little dam. “Lute—can you see any side-cracks splitting off left or right of my barrier? Tell me where, by finger-width, and I’ll patch them.”

*Agent reasoning: A trained finder-stitch is a bigger mystery; I want to learn who trained it while also preventing it from rerouting. I’ll ask the younger scribe for details and try to map/plug side cracks with warded paper without exposing Senn or my lamp.*

#### Turn 209 **[GAME]**

“Finder-stitch,” the younger scribe repeats, and you hear ink-stained fingers worrying a rosary-bead of wax somewhere in the dark. “Not Concord craft. Concord wards *repel*—they don’t hunt. An Archivist could design the *theory*, but this feels… field-trained.”

She answers your second question like she hates that she knows it. “It finds *reference points*. Things that ‘belong’ in a record: signatures, true names, blood that’s been written into oath-ledgers. And—” a pause, “—lamp-oil that’s been blessed and catalogued.”

At that, Lute’s knuckles whiten around his hooded lantern handle.

You keep the mica strip steady on the main crack. With your other hand you tear a narrow ribbon from a fresh warded sheet—paper fibers resist, then give with a dry, clean rip—and you slide the ribbon out along the floor.

It moves smoothly for a handspan… then stops dead against something you can’t see.

Not stone. Not grit.

The ribbon’s edge *sticks* as if it’s kissed pitch. A hair-fine line rises from the hairline branch—so thin it’s almost nothing—touches the ribbon, and tries to climb it the way it was climbing the plinth seam.

The warding holds, but you’ve learned something important by accident: **there was already a second filament in the branch crack, waiting, and it will test anything you feed into that fissure.**

Lute leans his head just enough to sight along the floor without moving his feet. “Left,” he says, voice tight. “Two finger-widths left of your paper-tab—there’s a split. And—gods—another one right, closer to me. One finger-width off my toe. Don’t—don’t make me step.”

As he speaks, the main filament you’ve been painting with mica slackens, then slides backward, *away* from the reflection—only to angle toward that left split Lute indicated, seeking a route around your first warded barrier.

Clear threat: **the finder-stitch is now attempting to bypass your primary dam via the left branch, while a second, thinner filament is already active in the branch where your ribbon caught. If either finds an unwarded seam past your patches, it can reach Lute (and any muffled metal, lamp, or catalogued oil) from underneath.**

Dock 9 of **Kestrel Spindle Station** is in its false-morning cycle, lights ramping up from red to pale white. Cold air tastes of oxidized metal and old coolant. Beyond the bay doors, the derelict hulk hangs in slow spin, emergency strips pulsing on its skin like weak signals.

You stand on the mag-plate ramp at the mouth of the boarding tube, helmet sealed, rifle slung but ready. Your left glove runs a practiced sweep over the tube’s latch points—tamper seal, hinge wear, microfracture—same routine you used on live-ops breaching collars. You mark angles and blind spots with quick glances, then tap your wrist slate to start a continuous bodycam loop Helix can’t “misplace.”

A Helix handler strides up the ramp, short and broad in a patched vac-suit with a cooperative emblem stitched over old scorch marks. Their name tag reads **Pell**. They don’t meet your eyes; they hold out a **sealed black-box canister** like it’s hot. “Recovered from a frost-welded compartment,” Pell says, voice flat through comms. “Log it as nonfunctional debris. Don’t open it. Don’t mention it.” The canister hums against your palm, faint through the insulation, and your visor flashes a residue scan without being asked: **BIOMETRIC MATCH—MARA VANCE / USMC ID**. The timestamp crawls in after it, years after your discharge.

Before you can speak, your comms crackle—port security broadcast, clipped and polite: **“Detainment notice. Mara Vance. Report for Admiralty debriefing.”** Down on the deck, two dock guards shift their stance toward the ramp. At the far edge of the bay, three workers in Vesper-gray coveralls stop pretending to load crates; one lifts a handheld receiver, and it chirps a repeating pattern that tightens in your ears when the canister is close.

Pell’s hand hovers near the canister seal, the guards start walking, and the Vesper runners watch you like they’ve finally found the right signal. You are holding evidence the Admiralty buried—and everyone here just moved at once.

#### Turn 10 **[PLAYER]**

I shove the black-box canister into my kit and snap my rifle into a low-ready. “Pell—move. Now.” I stride up the boarding tube toward the derelict; if the guards step in, I shoulder-check the first one into the deck and keep going.

*Agent reasoning: Everyone’s converging and the canister is tagged to me—if I let them take me, it disappears. I’m not talking my way out; I’m moving and using force if they try to stop me.*

#### Turn 11 **[GAME]**

The canister slides into your kit with a solid thunk against the inner frame. The hum doesn’t stop; it migrates—now it’s against your ribs, a distant vibration that makes your teeth feel slightly too present. Your rifle comes up to low-ready, muzzle down the tube.

“Pell—move. Now.”

Pell flinches and sidesteps hard, nearly clipping the handrail, giving you the lane without argument. “Mara—don’t—” is all they manage before swallowing it.

You hit the boarding tube at a brisk walk that turns into a controlled push. Halfway up, the nearer dock guard commits—boots clack on the ramp, body angling to block. “Vance! Stop. Admiralty—”

You don’t stop. You drive your shoulder through his chest plate.

The impact is real, not cinematic: his breath barks out, he pinwheels, and the mag in his boots fails for a half-second as his heel skates. He slams into the deck grating and stays down, one arm curling around his ribs, helmet ringing. His partner yells, “Assault! Lock the tube—lock it!”

A klaxon begins to wind up in the bay—low, rising. The boarding tube’s inner bulkhead light flips from green to amber as the station tries to engage a safety interlock behind you. The door doesn’t slam shut—too slow, too much inertia in the mechanism—but you hear the latch motors start to cycle.

From the bay behind, the Vesper workers peel off their crates. One of them—thin, shaved head—raises a compact launcher the size of a forearm. Not a gun: a **net-stapler**. “Don’t damage her!” someone barks. They’re aiming up the tube after you.

Ahead, the derelict’s outer hatch is already dogged open just enough for a person to slip through—like someone prepped it before you arrived. Cold breath spills out of the gap, carrying that old coolant tang.

You’re ten meters from the derelict hatch. Behind you: an alarm, one guard down, one calling in, and Vesper lining a capture shot up the tube. The station interlock is trying to close the tube behind you, but it hasn’t caught yet.

```

#### Turn 12 **[PLAYER]**

I snap my rifle up and put two quick shots into the net-stapler’s mechanism/hand, then lunge through the ajar hatch. Once inside, I spin and dog the hatch shut, slamming an emergency lock and yanking any manual release I can find—then I bark into comms, “Pell! If you want to live, tell me who prepped this hatch—now.”

*Agent reasoning: Net-stapler means capture; I need to break line-of-sight and deny pursuit. The derelict hatch is my choke point—get inside, then seal and booby-trap.*

#### Turn 13 **[GAME]**



#### Turn 14 **[PLAYER]**

I snap my rifle up and fire two fast shots at the net-stapler—one into the mechanism, one into the shooter’s hand—then dive through the ajar hatch. Inside, I spin, dog it shut, slam the emergency lock, and yank any manual release I can reach. “Pell! If you want to live, tell me who prepped this hatch—now.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m not getting bagged on a dock. Cripple the capture tool, get inside, seal the hatch, then squeeze Pell for answers.*

#### Turn 15 **[GAME]**

Your rifle snaps up. Two tight cracks hammer the tube.

The first round punches into the net-stapler’s forward housing. The tool coughs a burst of sparks and dies mid-cycle, its cartridge clattering off the guardrail. The second round takes the shaved-head runner in the hand—clean through the webbing between thumb and forefinger. He howls and drops the launcher, blood globing and drifting in slow beads before his suit’s microseals cinch and smear it into a dark stain.

“Fuck—MED!” one of the other Vesper workers shouts, but they don’t rush him; they flatten instead, suddenly wary of your sightline. Dock Guard #2 ducks behind the ramp strut and barks into his mic, “She’s armed, she’s boarding—seal that tube!”

You dive through the derelict’s ajar hatch.

Cold hits like a slap. The interior is dim, emergency strips pulsing weakly. Your boots find purchase on a frost-slick deckplate; you catch yourself on the inner frame, then pivot back to the hatch.

You dog the wheel shut—metal groans, old seals complain—and slam the emergency lock lever down. It *clicks* into place… then immediately chatters, like it can’t decide if it’s engaged. You yank a manual release cable and feel it bite your glove, stiff with ice. The hatch stays shut, but not cleanly; there’s a thin, bright line at the seam where the gasket doesn’t fully seat.

From the other side, something impacts the hatch—boots or a shoulder—once, hard. The wheel judders in your hands. A voice muffled through the metal, Dock Guard #2: “Open it! You’re under detainment—”

Your comms spit static, then Pell comes through, breathing fast. “Mara—listen. I didn’t— I swear I didn’t prep anything. That hatch was logged *welded* yesterday.” A pause, then quieter, scared: “Helix doesn’t have cutters that clean. Admiralty does. And—” their voice drops further— “Vesper’s been paying station hands to ‘soften’ seals. Someone wanted you inside.”

Behind you, deeper in the derelict, a panel ticks in time with the ship’s slow spin. Your visor briefly highlights a smear on the bulkhead beside the hatch—like a handprint in oil-black residue—fresh enough to shine. It is on the *inside* of the ship.

Outside the hatch, the pounding stops. Not because they gave up—because they’ve changed tactics. You hear the faint whine of a tool spooling up against the seam, searching for purchase on the imperfect seal.

#### Turn 16 **[PLAYER]**

I back off the hatch two steps, plant my feet, and fire a short burst into the seam/locking mechanism from the inside to warp it shut. Then I yank my knife, scrape a sample of that oil-black handprint into a sealable patch pouch, and sweep my rifle light down the corridor. “Pell—name the Admiralty team on Dock 9. Now. And tell me if this derelict has internal cameras or a map, fast.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re cutting in; I need distance, a choke point, and answers fast. The fresh residue inside means I’m not alone—clear the immediate area and set a trap while grilling Pell.*

#### Turn 17 **[GAME]**



#### Turn 18 **[PLAYER]**

I back off the hatch two steps, brace, and hammer a short burst into the seam/lock assembly from inside to warp it shut. I draw my knife, scrape the oil-black handprint into a sealable patch pouch, then sweep my rifle light down the corridor. “Pell—name the Admiralty team on Dock 9. Now. And does this derelict have internal cameras or a map?”

*Agent reasoning: I’m not letting them cut in behind me; I’ll brute-force the hatch into staying shut, pocket evidence, then demand names and intel so I know who’s hunting me and how to move inside.*

#### Turn 19 **[GAME]**

You brace and fire. The burst hammers the seam and lock assembly—metal flashes white-hot in pinprick blooms, spalling flecks of alloy across the deck. The hatch wheel jolts once, then the lock’s chatter turns into a single ugly *clunk* as something inside warps out of alignment.

On the other side, the cutting whine stutters and stops. A muffled curse carries through the hatch. Whatever tool they had just lost its bite—at least for the moment.

But your shots also do something else: the inner gasket smokes, and the air right around the seam turns sharp and acrid. Your visor flags a brief pressure fluctuation as the damaged seal “breathes” once—an inward sip—then stabilizes. The hatch is more *jammed* than *sealed* now.

You pull your knife and scrape the oil-black smear. It doesn’t flake like grease; it comes up in a thin, tacky ribbon that strings for a second before snapping into the patch pouch. The residue clings to the blade like it wants to crawl back.

You sweep your rifle light down the corridor.

The beam cuts through drifting dust and frost motes. Ten meters in, the passage bends left around a ribbed bulkhead. Along the right wall: conduit runs beaded with condensation, and a maintenance alcove with its cover hanging open. Inside that alcove, a status panel is dark—except for a single diode that blinks in a pattern that doesn’t match the emergency strip cadence. Once your light hits it, it pauses, then resumes—slower.

Pell comes back on comms, voice tight. “Dock 9 Admiralty presence isn’t a team—there’s no manifest. That’s the problem. Port Security got a detainment notice routed from *Office of Anomalous Losses*, stamped by a clerk ID: **Lysa Koen**. That name’s been on Helix ‘audit’ emails before.”

A beat of static, then: “Internal cameras—if they’re still powered, they’d be on the ship’s old security loop. Map… there should be a deckplan in the service crawl or a bridge terminal, but this hull’s registry is scraped. Helix couldn’t pull a schematic. If you find a working node, ping me its port ID and I’ll try to handshake.”

Outside the hatch, you hear boots repositioning—two sets at least—then a quieter sound: something being taped or clamped to the metal, careful and deliberate. Not prying now. Setting.

Whatever they’re doing, they’re preparing to force the hatch without cutting it.

#### Turn 20 **[PLAYER]**

I backpedal hard to the bend, take cover behind the ribbed bulkhead, and aim my rifle at the hatch line-of-sight. Then I snap my light onto that maintenance alcove diode and move in fast, ripping the cover wider to find a port or manual controls—anything that gives cameras, doors, or atmosphere. “Pell—Lysa Koen, got it. Stand by for a port ID. If they breach, I’m shooting through the hatch—so tell me now: is this hull pressurized enough to vent them if I pop something?”

*Agent reasoning: They’re setting a charge or clamp; staying by the hatch is stupid. I need distance, cover, and a way to flank or vent them—plus that blinking diode looks like a live node I can use for cameras/map fast.*

#### Turn 21 **[GAME]**

You backpedal to the bend and tuck in behind the ribbed bulkhead. From here you’ve got a narrow lane back to the hatch—enough to see the inner wheel and that imperfect seam line, but not enough for anyone outside to get a clean shot at you unless they come through.

You snap your light onto the maintenance alcove and close the distance fast. The cover is already half-hung; you rip it wider. The hinge squeals and a brittle strip of frost shears off.

Inside: a compact service bay—old ship-standard. A manual atmosphere tap (three-position lever), a diagnostics jack, and a palm-sized status screen that should be dead. The blinking diode isn’t a simple indicator; it’s a tiny optical sensor, jury-rigged onto the bay’s frame with station tape. Someone planted it here recently.

When your light hits it, the sensor’s blink pattern changes again—then the status screen *wakes* with a thin green line of text, like it’s been waiting for motion:

**NODE 3A — ACCESS: DENIED**  
**LAST AUTH: VANCE, M.**  
**TIME: — — : — — : — —**

No timestamp. Just your name.

You jam your fingers into the diagnostics jack looking for an exposed port ID. The jack collar is warm compared to the surrounding metal, like current has been running through it. Stamped into the plate beneath: **3A-19**.

Behind you at the hatch, the careful clamping sound stops. A new sound replaces it: a soft, escalating whirr—an inflator or a chemical bladder pressurizing against the seam. A wedge charge, meant to force the hatch by brute expansion rather than cutting. The wheel trembles a fraction, then holds… for now.

Pell answers, fast. “I don’t have reliable pressure numbers—Helix logs say the hulk’s at *maintenance atmosphere*, thin but present. Enough to fog your visor, not enough to explosively vent a team. If you punch a hole, you’ll get a pull, not a decompression blast. It might drag loose debris and it’ll scream in their ears—but it won’t suck them out like a movie.”

As Pell talks, the service bay screen adds a second line, unprompted:

**CAM LOOP: ACTIVE**  
**FEED: /HATCH/DOCK9**

So yes—there are cameras. And something on this ship is already watching the hatch for you.

```json

```

#### Turn 22 **[PLAYER]**

I slam the atmosphere lever to **VENT** and keep my rifle trained down the hatch lane, then I jam my comms. “Pell—NODE 3A-19. Get me that cam feed and any door/pressure controls, now.”  
I lean into the service bay and start ripping at the panel and wiring to bypass the lock—no finesse—then I settle back behind the ribbed bulkhead, ready to put rounds into the first helmet that clears the hatch.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to wedge-breach the hatch; I need immediate control—cameras and atmosphere—then I’ll ambush the first body through. That “LAST AUTH: VANCE” is a trap or someone spoofing me, so I’m forcing the node and using the cam feed to time my shots.*

#### Turn 23 **[GAME]**



#### Turn 24 **[PLAYER]**

I slam the atmosphere lever to **VENT** and keep my rifle trained down the hatch lane. “Pell—NODE 3A-19. Get me that cam feed and any door or pressure controls, now.”

I rip into the service bay paneling and wiring with my knife and gauntlet, trying to brute-force a bypass. Then I drop back behind the ribbed bulkhead, sighting the hatch and waiting to put rounds into the first helmet that comes through.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch team is about to breach; I need to make the environment hostile and grab any control/cam advantage immediately, then set a kill lane.*

#### Turn 25 **[GAME]**



#### Turn 26 **[PLAYER]**

I smack my comms twice. “Pell, talk to me—do you have NODE 3A-19 or not?”  

If no answer, I kill my light, move back to the hatch lane, and plant a strip-charge from my kit on the corridor wall beside the hatch—set to blow inward the moment they breach—then I shoulder my rifle and hold the angle.

*Agent reasoning: Nothing’s happening on-screen; I’m not waiting. I need immediate control or intel, and if comms are dead I’ll act on the breach threat.*

#### Turn 27 **[GAME]**

Your comms click twice under your thumb.

Static. Then Pell’s voice comes back chopped and doubled, like two recordings fighting for the same channel.

“—ra, I’ve got—” *hiss* “NODE—” *hiss* “—3A—19—” *hiss* “—no feed, it’s—”  

Then, underneath Pell, a second voice rides the carrier—flat, close, and wrong, like it’s speaking from inside your helmet:

“**Mara Vance. Stand by for debriefing.**”

Your visor flickers. The service bay screen across the alcove flashes once: **CAM LOOP: ACTIVE** then goes dark.

You kill your light.

In the dark, the hatch lane is a thin silhouette: the inner wheel, the seam, the wedge device pressed against it. The whirr spikes—pressure building.

You move back and slap a strip-charge onto the corridor wall beside the hatch.

It doesn’t stick.

The adhesive pad skates on a film you can’t see—oil-black, tacky in the wrong way, like it’s sweating out of the metal itself. You press harder; it slides again and leaves a smeared crescent on your glove. The charge’s arming LED blinks once, then steadies—armed, but not placed.

At the hatch, the wedge finally bites. Metal groans. The wheel twitches a quarter-turn on its own, not from hands—like the mechanism is being forced from the other side. A hairline gap opens at the seam and cold, thin air whistles in, carrying the sharp sting of propellant.

A voice from outside, muffled by the hatch: “Hold—don’t—” then a bang as something shifts.

The gap widens to a finger’s width. A narrow beam of light stabs through from Dock 9, sweeping the corridor just below your position.

You’re in the dark with an armed strip-charge in your hand that won’t adhere, a breach in progress, and at least one person outside trying to control whoever’s forcing entry.

```json
{"inventory_add":[],"inventory_remove":[],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":[],"npcs_add":[]}
```

#### Turn 28 **[PLAYER]**

I palm the armed strip-charge, yank off anything that’ll snag, and shove it into the widening seam like a grenade. “Pell—if you hear me, they’re breaching!”

The second it’s in, I snap to the bulkhead edge and dump a tight burst at the first shadow/light that tries to push through, then I peel back deeper around the bend to avoid the blast and any return fire.

*Agent reasoning: The charge won’t stick and the breach is imminent; I need a kill zone now. I’ll use the charge as a hand-thrown blast into the gap and immediately engage the first target, then reposition before they return fire.*

#### Turn 29 **[GAME]**

You jam the strip-charge into the seam the moment it’s wide enough. This time it catches—wedged between the inner lip and the dogging ring, half-swallowed by the hatch like a bad tooth.

“Pell—if you hear me, they’re breaching!”

Your comm answers with a wet burst of carrier noise. No words.

A shape crowds the gap—light first, then the rounded edge of a helmet trying to angle in. You snap out, rifle tight, and put a controlled burst right into the beam.

Rounds spark off metal and something hard; one hits softer—there’s a sharp, human yelp and the light jerks wildly, smearing the corridor in white arcs. The helmet vanishes from the slit.

From the other side, someone shouts, panicked and close: “Back—BACK—there’s a charge—!”

Too late.

The strip-charge goes off inside the seam with a flat, concussive *WHUMP* that you feel in your teeth more than you hear. The hatch ring deforms and the gap flashes orange-white; fragments of gasket and a spray of frost and black oil spit into the corridor like shrapnel. The hatch wheel snaps a fraction, then locks crooked.

You peel back around the bend as the blast wind slaps down the corridor, carrying burned adhesive, propellant, and that coolant-metal tang. A second later, return fire rakes where you were—two sharp cracks and impacts chewing the ribbed bulkhead edge, sending needle-splinters of alloy pinging into the deck.

Outside the hatch, a voice—Dock Guard #2, strained—barks through the damaged seam: “Cease fire! Cease—! We’ve got one down! Vance, don’t—”

Then another voice cuts in over him, calm and amplified like it’s coming through an official mask amp: “Mara Vance. You are ordered to stand down.”

The hatch isn’t fully breached—but it’s warped, leaking a thin, constant whistle. Someone is still out there with a weapon and at least one injured body in the lane. Your glove is smeared with oil-black residue from the seam.

```json
{"inventory_add":[],"inventory_remove":["Strip-charge"],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":[],"npcs_add":[]}
```

#### Turn 30 **[PLAYER]**

I press in behind the bend, rifle up. “Negative. Identify yourself with code and badge number—now. Dock Guard, drag your wounded back or I finish this.”

I scrape the oil-black smear off my glove onto the deck, then ghost a step deeper down the corridor to a new angle and hold on the warped seam, finger ready—waiting for the next peek.

*Agent reasoning: That “stand down” voice is either a hostile spoof or the same nightmare chain-of-command crap that got me burned; either way I’m not surrendering. They’ve got a downed person—leverage. I’ll force ID and buy seconds while I reposition to a better kill lane.*

#### Turn 31 **[GAME]**

You tuck in behind the bend, rifle shouldered, muzzle tracking the warped seam down the hatch lane. Your voice carries clean in the corridor.

“Negative. Identify yourself with code and badge number—now. Dock Guard, drag your wounded back or I finish this.”

On the far side of the hatch, there’s a scuffle—boots scraping the tube deck, someone grunting as weight shifts. A thin smear of light wobbles at the seam, then dips away as if they’re trying to shield it.

Dock Guard #2 answers, breathy and tight with pain-adrenaline. “Dock Security—Kestrel Spindle—Unit Two! That wasn’t—” He cuts himself off, then louder, to someone beside him: “Get him back. Move!”

The amplified voice comes again, closer to the seam, calm to the point of sterile. “Admiralty Office of Anomalous Losses. Field Liaison. Badge number **AOL-17-443**. Code: **Tern-Gray**. Stand down and exit the derelict with hands visible.”

You scrape the oil-black smear off your glove onto the deck plating. It doesn’t splatter like grease—more like it *strings*, pulling a thin filament before it snaps and settles. The spot it lands on dulls the metal, as if the corridor’s finish drinks it in. For half a second your visor highlights it as a contaminant… then the tag blanks out and reverts to “NO DATA.”

You ghost one step deeper, changing your angle on the seam.

From this position you see the hatch ring clearly: warped inward, gasket shredded, a steady whisper of air bleeding through. And in the seam’s thin light line, something moves—too narrow to be a person. A gloved hand *should* appear first.

Instead, a pale strip—like a fingertip pressed to glass—slides along the gap from left to right, leaving a faint wet trace on the metal lip. It pauses exactly where you shoved the charge.

Outside, Dock Guard #2’s voice drops, frightened despite himself: “What the hell is—”

Then a hard metallic clink: something small rolls into the seam’s light line from the dock side and stops—cylindrical, about the size of a thumb. A sensor drone or a flash unit.

It sits there for a beat, inert.

Your comms crackle without you touching them, and Pell’s voice comes through in a rush, finally clear: “Mara—don’t let them get eyes inside—whatever’s on that ship is spoofing—”

The drone’s indicator LED blinks once.

```json

```

#### Turn 32 **[PLAYER]**

I snap two rounds into the little cylinder to kill it, then bark into the seam, “AOL-17-443 means nothing to me. Pull back from the hatch or I start shooting anything that moves on the other side.” I keep the rifle trained on the gap and shift my feet for a tighter brace, ready to fire the instant that pale strip shows again.

*Agent reasoning: I’m not letting some Admiralty spook or a drone get eyes in here—Pell warned it’s spoofing, and that fingertip thing is wrong. Fast, violent solution: kill the drone, then threaten them off the hatch while I keep my angle.*

#### Turn 33 **[GAME]**

You put two rounds into the cylinder.

The first hit punches it sideways and cracks its casing; the second turns it into a brief, bright spit of sparks. The indicator LED dies. A curl of gray smoke threads out through the seam and gets yanked back toward Dock 9 by the pressure gradient.

Your shout carries through the warped hatch.

“AOL-17-443 means nothing to me. Pull back from the hatch or I start shooting anything that moves on the other side.”

For a moment, there’s only the thin whistle of the leak and the distant groan of the derelict.

Then Dock Guard #2, louder now, trying to keep control: “Liaison—step back! She’s armed and you’re not cleared—”

Something heavy scrapes against the hatch from the outside—like a shoulder or a tool braced against the ring. The seam flexes a fraction wider, protesting with a metallic squeal.

The amplified voice answers, still calm, but closer and more directive: “Vance, you have already fired on station security. Continued resistance will be treated as hostile action. Stand down.”

A sharp *thup* follows—another object strikes the hatch and clings. Not a cylinder this time: a flat puck the size of your palm, magnet-locked to the ring just above the seam. A faint blue arc skitters across its edge as it wakes up.

The whistle changes pitch. The puck starts to *cut*—not explosively, but steadily, heating the metal along the warp line. The seam begins to glow a dull red thread.

At the same time, that pale strip returns—right where the glow is forming—pressed from the *inside* of the hatch now, not the dock side. It drags slowly along the heated line, leaving a wet sheen that hisses when it touches the warming metal. The glow dims where it passes, as if the heat is being bled away.

Dock Guard #2’s voice breaks, suddenly raw: “That’s not us—! Liaison, what did you put on—”

Return fire doesn’t come. Instead, the breach attempt changes: they’re cutting, and something on your side of the hatch is interfering with it.

Your rifle is still trained on the gap. The threat is now twofold and immediate: an external cutting charge opening the hatch, and an unknown presence on the derelict side moving at the seam.

#### Turn 34 **[PLAYER]**

I lean out just enough and dump rounds into the cutting puck to try to shatter it off the ring. “Dock Guard—if you’re not the ones doing that, then drag your ‘liaison’ back before I ventilate him through the seam.”

Then I backpedal to the next intersection for cover, plant myself on a hard angle facing the hatch lane, and key my comm: “Pell, I need an override—lock that hatch or dump pressure Dock 9 side. Anything.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re cutting in and whatever’s inside is right at the seam. I’m not letting either side control that hatch—destroy the cutter, then fall back to a kill zone and force them to talk.*

#### Turn 35 **[GAME]**

You lean out and hose the puck.

Rounds hammer the hatch ring, throwing bright splinters of alloy. One slug catches the puck’s edge; it skitters a few centimeters, still magnet-locked, and the blue arc stutters. Another hit finally cracks its housing—there’s a brief flare, like an arc-welder choking, and the cutting line goes dark.

The seam stops glowing. The whistle drops back to its earlier pitch.

On the other side, Dock Guard #2 shouts, hoarse and furious: “Liaison! BACK UP—NOW!” You hear boots scramble, then a dragged weight. Someone—injured—cries out as they’re hauled away from the tube mouth.

The amplified voice snaps once, losing its calm for the first time: “Hold position. Vance is contained—”

A single shot answers him—Dock Guard #2 firing. Metal pings. Then silence, except for breathing and the faint leak.

You backpedal hard to the next intersection, planting yourself on a tight angle with the hatch lane in sight. From here you can see the warped hatch mouth as a sliver of light around the bend and the puck’s dead casing still stuck to the ring like a tick.

You key your comm. “Pell, I need an override—lock that hatch or dump pressure Dock 9 side. Anything.”

Pell comes in clipped, scared, and moving—background noise of a station corridor and someone shouting for med. “I don’t have hard control of Dock 9. Port authority does. Helix lease doesn’t touch pressure systems.” He swallows. “I can *ask* for a lockdown, but if Admiralty’s on-scene they’ll countermand it.”

A beat of static—then Pell again, lower: “Mara… I’m seeing a detainment notice hit your file. AOL is pushing it as ‘routine debrief.’ They’re not here for the guards.”

Down the hatch lane, you hear a new sound: a soft, rhythmic tap—tap… tap… tap—coming from the derelict side of the warped ring, like something lightly knocking from inside the metal. It’s not at the seam anymore; it’s traveling along the hatch frame, moving away from the breach point toward the tube’s upper quadrant.

Whatever left that pale strip is repositioning.

#### Turn 36 **[PLAYER]**

I key my comm, low and sharp: “Pell, forget asking—start a noise storm on Dock 9 feeds. Spoof a hazard alarm, anything to buy me two minutes.”

I pull a frag bolt from my kit, whip it into the hatch lane aimed high at the upper quadrant where the tapping’s traveling, then immediately shift to the opposite side of the intersection and hold my rifle steady on the seam—ready to shoot the first limb, light, or tool that shows.

*Agent reasoning: AOL is trying to bag me; the hatch is compromised and something inside is moving along the frame. I need to stop the breach and remove the leverage—go loud, go decisive: sabotage the hatch from my side and reposition before they flank me.*

#### Turn 37 **[GAME]**



#### Turn 38 **[PLAYER]**

“Pell—forget asking. Flood Dock 9 feeds with a noise storm. Spoof a hazard alarm—anything. Buy me two minutes.”

I yank a frag bolt and whip it down the hatch lane aimed high at the upper quadrant where the tapping’s moving, then snap to the opposite side of the intersection and keep my rifle welded to the seam, waiting to shoot the first thing that shows.

*Agent reasoning: I need confusion on the dock side and to stop whatever’s moving along the hatch frame before it finds a new way in; explosives and a hard angle give me control.*

#### Turn 39 **[GAME]**

Pell answers fast, breathless. “I can jam *some* of it—Dock 9’s a public spine, I don’t own their cams. But I can dirty the channel.”

A second later your comm hisses with layered garbage—burst static, looping error tones, a chopped-up evacuation message that sounds like it’s been stitched from old drills. Over it, you catch Dock Guard #2 yelling at someone off-mic: “—feeds are gone—who the hell is on the line—”

You yank the frag bolt and whip it down the lane.

It clacks off the bulkhead near the hatch mouth and sticks high on the frame where the tapping had been traveling. Half a heartbeat later it detonates with a hard, concussive pop that thumps through your chest even around the corner. Shrapnel rattles down the tube like hail. The warped hatch ring screams as fragments chew it; a spray of frost and grit erupts from the seam and then gets sucked back toward Dock 9.

The tapping stops.

Then something answers from the other side: not a voice—an impact. The hatch ring *bucks* once, as if hit from inside with a shoulder or a tool. The seam widens by a few millimeters, enough to spit a thin, white ribbon of vapor into the derelict corridor before the pressure equalizes and it thins.

You shift to the opposite side of the intersection, rifle steady on the seam.

A thin line of light appears in that widened gap—station-side illumination cutting through. In it, something slides into view briefly: not a limb, not a tool. A smear of oil-black residue, dragged across the metal from the *inside* of the derelict, leaving a fresh print that looks like the heel of a hand.

Dock Guard #2’s voice punches through the comm-storm for a second, closer now and panicked: “Vance—there’s someone in the tube with us— I can’t—” The transmission collapses into static.

At the seam, a small object rolls into the gap from the dock side and stops, wedged: a second puck—different housing, heavier, with a blinking amber status light. It doesn’t cut. It starts to *chirp* in a tight ultrasonic pattern that makes your teeth ache through the helmet.

The threat is immediate and clear: they’ve switched from cutting to a sensor/denial device at the seam, and the hatch gap is now wide enough for something on either side to probe through.

```json
{"inventory_add":[],"inventory_remove":["frag bolt"],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":[],"npcs_add":[]}
```

#### Turn 40 **[PLAYER]**

I put three tight shots into the amber puck to silence it, then bark down the lane, “Dock Guard—BACK OFF the hatch! Next gadget that rolls in gets you shot with it.”

I rip a strip of foil tape from my kit and slap it over my helmet’s external mic port to damp the ultrasonic bite, then settle back into my hard angle with the rifle trained on the widened seam, waiting for whatever’s inside to try it.

*Agent reasoning: That chirping puck is a sensor/sonic denial tool and it’s wedged in my lane—kill it fast. Then I need eyes on the seam in case something tries to probe through, and I want Dock Guard to stop feeding the liaison gadgets.*

#### Turn 41 **[GAME]**

Three shots crack down the hatch lane.

The first round punches the amber puck and it sparks, the chirp warbling. The second shatters the housing; the light dies. The third skips off the hatch ring with a sharp *ping* and disappears into the tube.

The ultrasonic bite in your teeth eases immediately—replaced by the normal thin whistle of air and the distant station alarm loop Pell injected, still stuttering through the comm.

Your shout carries.

For a second there’s only breathing and the clatter of someone stumbling backward. Dock Guard #2 comes back, voice strained and close to the mic like he’s crouched behind something: “Copy—copy. We’re backing off. I’ve got one down and—” He cuts himself off, swallowing. “There’s… something in here with us. I can’t see it. It’s—” His channel pops and drops into static again, like someone yanked the line.

You slap foil tape over your external mic port. Your own breathing dulls, and the station noise becomes slightly muffled—usable, but blunted.

At the widened seam, the thin ribbon of vapor stops drifting and starts pulsing—puff… pause… puff—like someone on the other side is modulating the gap with pressure.

Then the oil-black smear you saw earlier begins to *move*. Not run—*creep*, as if the residue is being drawn along the metal by an unseen finger. It drags itself into a shape: a partial handprint, then a second beside it, placed carefully, like someone testing the edge.

A tool doesn’t come through.

Instead, a single gloved fingertip—pale fabric over something too rigid—presses into the gap from the derelict side. It probes once, slow, feeling for the puck’s carcass, for the metal lip, for you.

And from the dock side of the tube, something *scrapes* along the inside wall—close enough that you hear it as vibration through the bulkhead—moving away from the hatch mouth toward the station, as if whatever Dock Guard #2 sensed is repositioning to flank from *your* side.

The immediate threats are now split: one probe at the seam from inside the derelict, and an unseen presence in the boarding tube on the station side, closing distance out of your line of sight.

```json
{"inventory_add":[],"inventory_remove":[],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":[],"npcs_add":[]}
```

#### Turn 42 **[PLAYER]**

I snap one shot at the probing fingertip through the seam, then immediately peel off the angle and move down the corridor toward the station-side scrape, rifle up. “Show yourself—now—or I start stitching the walls.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m getting flanked on the station side; I can’t hold this angle and watch the seam. I’ll disable the probing finger fast, then reposition to cover the approach and force the unseen thing to show itself.*

#### Turn 43 **[GAME]**

Your shot takes the fingertip clean.

The round cracks through the narrow gap with a shower of bright filings. The probing digit jerks back so hard it scrapes the seam—leaving a short, wet-looking streak of that oil-black residue. There’s no yelp. No curse. Just a soft *tap*—like knuckle on metal—answered by a second tap deeper inside the derelict, as if something relayed the signal.

You peel off the hard angle and move down the corridor toward the station-side scrape.

Two steps in, your visor catches motion at floor level: a thin, translucent filament stretched across the corridor at shin height—almost invisible except where it beads condensation. You hit it with your boot.

It *snaps* and a small canister the size of your thumb, magneted to the bulkhead, pops and vents a tight cone of glittering particulate into the air—micro-chaff. It blooms fast, clinging to your suit and visor like frost-dust.

Your HUD stutters. Range marks jitter. The corridor’s emergency strips smear into doubled lines for a second.

From ahead—station side—you get your answer: a figure resolves through the chaff at the corridor bend, low and wrong, not in a suit silhouette you recognize. Something drags along the deck with a dry scrape: metal on metal. It doesn’t step into the light so much as *interrupt* it.

Dock Guard #2’s voice blasts back into your muffled comm, panicked and too loud: “IT’S RIGHT—” The rest is swallowed by a strangled grunt and a heavy impact, like a body hitting the tube wall.

The figure in the corridor tilts its head toward that sound, then toward you. A flat reflective patch—visor or faceplate—catches the pulsing strip light and flashes your own outline back at you.

It raises an arm. In its hand: a cutter head or pry tool—something salvage-grade—held like a weapon, but it doesn’t rush. It advances one slow step, dragging the metal edge behind it to keep that scrape constant, measuring distance by sound.

You’ve got chaff fouling your sensors, an unknown hostile between you and the station-side tube, and Dock Guard #2 has just been grabbed or slammed hard enough to cut his transmission.

```

#### Turn 44 **[PLAYER]**

“Wrong corridor.”

I yank a flash charge and bounce it low off the deck toward the bend, then surge forward right behind the pop—rifle up for center-mass, ready to transition to a buttstroke if it closes.

*Agent reasoning: Sensors are compromised and it’s advancing by sound; I’ll go loud and brutal—flash it, then close and put it down before it reaches me or hits the guards.*

#### Turn 45 **[GAME]**

The flash charge skitters where you sent it, a low bounce off the deck, sliding into the chaff-hazed bend.

It pops with a brutal white bloom that fills the corridor and turns the emergency strips into afterimages. Your visor auto-dims a fraction late; for half a second you’re blind anyway.

When your sight snaps back, the figure at the bend is no longer where it was.

You surged forward right behind the pop—fast, committed—and you run into something hard at chest height. Not a body: a length of salvage cable strung across the corridor, now visible because the flash lit the condensation on it. It catches your rifle and slams it sideways into the bulkhead with a metallic *clang* that echoes down the hull.

At the same moment, the “scrape” you were tracking shifts—now behind you, closer to Dock 9. The sound wasn’t the figure dragging metal forward; it was metal being dragged along the deck to *mask movement* and pull your attention.

A shape detaches from the shadowed recess beside the bend—right where your flash would force you to look past it. It comes in low and fast, using the cable as a guide. You glimpse a reflective faceplate and a forearm with a salvage pry tool, but the motion is practiced: it doesn’t swing for your head, it hooks for your weapon.

The pry tool bites under your rifle’s fore-end and wrenches. Your grip holds, but the muzzle is levered off center-mass and up toward the ceiling. The hostile uses that moment to shoulder in, trying to jam you into the bulkhead and take away your range.

Down the lane toward the tube, Dock Guard #2’s comm—still partially muffled by your taped mic—bursts with a wet gasp and a single word: “Mara—” then a thud, and silence.

Immediate threat: you’re in a clinch at arm’s length with an unknown hostile actively trying to disarm you, your rifle pinned off-target by leverage, with a trip-cable at your chest limiting your movement and a second threat implied behind you near Dock 9.

#### Turn 46 **[PLAYER]**

I let the rifle go limp for a split second and drive my knee up hard into its midsection, then stomp back to clear space and slash my combat knife across the salvage cable at chest height. “Try that again and I’ll take the arm off.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m not winning a tug-of-war on a pinned rifle; I need to break the clinch fast and make space. I’ll use brute force—drop my weight, cut the cable, and go for a disabling strike.*

#### Turn 47 **[GAME]**

You go limp on the rifle for a heartbeat—just enough that the hostile’s pry leverage overcommits.

Your knee comes up hard into its midsection.

Impact lands on something rigid under the suit—plate or tool harness—not flesh. It still works: the figure hitches, weight coming off you, and the pry tool slips a fraction. You feel the rifle free up in your hands again.

But the hostile answers instantly. It doesn’t grunt—it *clicks*, a short mechanical sound through the faceplate, and drives its shoulder into you as it recovers, trying to keep you pinned.

You stomp back, forcing a sliver of space, and your knife flashes up to the salvage cable at chest height.

The blade bites—and skates.

The cable isn’t soft wire. It’s braided salvage line with a ceramic core; you score it, fray a few strands, but it doesn’t part. The recoil of the cut vibrates up your arm.

The hostile uses that vibration like a cue. Its free hand snaps out and clamps your knife wrist—glove on glove, grip like a clamp—then twists, not to take the knife, but to angle it *into the cable*.

You feel the line tighten. The hostile is trying to turn your own cut into a saw, to pull you forward into the tension point.

Behind you, toward Dock 9, the scrape returns—closer now, steady and deliberate. Something is approaching from the tube side, and it’s using the deck to announce itself.

The figure in front of you tilts its reflective faceplate inches from yours. In the flash-dim light, your visor catches a smear on its faceplate: an oil-black handprint, placed where your own palm would land if you pushed it away.

It speaks in a voice that doesn’t match the body—flat, filtered, familiar in the wrong way: “You always threaten the arm.”

Then it yanks the cable.

Not to choke you—low enough to catch your rifle and forearms—trying to trap weapon and knife-hand together as the second presence closes from behind.

#### Turn 48 **[PLAYER]**

I drop my weight hard to duck under the cable tension, then twist my knife wrist inward and drive the blade into its gripping forearm at the joint to make it let go. As soon as it loosens, I shove off the bulkhead, bring my rifle back up, and fire two rounds center-mass while backpedaling to keep both threats in front of me. “Pell—where’s the second one, now!”

*Agent reasoning: I’m getting trapped between the cable and a second threat; talking is pointless. I need space and a hard stop—drop weight, break the wrist grip, and put rounds into something vital before the rear threat arrives.*

#### Turn 49 **[GAME]**

You drop your weight to slip under the cable’s bite. It works—your shoulders clear the line and the tension loses its leverage on your forearms.

Your knife wrist twists inward and you drive the blade into the hostile’s gripping forearm at the joint.

The knife goes in with a gritty *crunch*—not bone. Composite. The suit fabric puckers and then *weeps* oil-black fluid that beads instead of spraying. The clamp-grip loosens immediately; the hand opens like it lost power. The figure recoils a half-step, forearm twitching in small, wrong pulses.

You shove off the bulkhead, rip your rifle back into your shoulder, and fire two rounds center-mass.

Both shots land. The impacts kick up sparks and dark flecks off its torso plating. The figure staggers but doesn’t fold; it absorbs the hits with a stiff, delayed sway, then re-centers itself like it’s correcting balance rather than reacting to pain.

You backpedal to keep the bend and Dock 9 in front of you—

—and your heel hits the feathered frost at the right-hand seam.

The deck bites back. Ice blooms around your boot in a fast, white flower, anchoring you. The seam exhales a needle-cold gust that needles into suit joints; your ankle goes numb in a heartbeat and your balance yanks sideways. Something in the wall shifts with the sound of wet fabric peeling free.

On the bulkhead beside you—right where the frost feathers out—those oily fingerprints aren’t just stains anymore. A thin sheet of black slough peels off the wall like skin coming unstuck, sliding toward your trapped ankle.

Ahead, the shot figure raises its pry tool again, one-handed now, and starts forward—slow, deliberate—while behind it, near Dock 9, the scrape you heard becomes a *dragging step*. A second silhouette edges into view through the chaff haze, staying just out of the light.

Your comm crackles as you bark for Pell. His reply comes late and tight, like he’s speaking with someone else in the room: “Vance, I don’t have— I don’t have a ‘second.’ Get back to the tube. Now.”

Your boot is freezing into the deck, the wall-slough is reaching for your ankle, and you’ve got at least two hostiles in the corridor—one wounded, one closing from the tube side.

#### Turn 50 **[PLAYER]**

I drop to a knee and dump a burst into the ice blooming around my boot and the peeling black slough on the wall, then yank my leg free even if it rips the boot seal. I snap a shot at the wounded one’s faceplate to slow it, then start falling back toward the tube. “Pell—open the inner door and vent this damn corridor, now!”

*Agent reasoning: I’m getting pinned by the environment with two hostiles closing; I need mobility first, then I’ll force a retreat path with violence.*

#### Turn 51 **[GAME]**

You drop to a knee, rifle braced, and dump a burst at your boot.

Rounds chew the ice bloom into powder and steaming chips. The frost sheath fractures—but the cold seam under it *answers*: the split in the bulkhead exhales again, and the ice tries to re-knit even as you’re destroying it.

You rake the same burst across the peeling black slough on the wall. It reacts like wet fabric and hot tar at once—puckering, snapping back, and then *splattering* in thick droplets that slap your shin and the deck. Where the droplets land, the frost feathers harder, faster.

You yank your leg free.

The boot seal tears with a sharp rip. Your suit screams a pressure warning in your ear; a thin, painful cold knifes into your foot. You’re mobile again, but your right boot is compromised—every step leaves a faint mist of escaping air and a spreading rim of rime around your tread.

You snap a shot at the wounded one’s faceplate.

The round hits dead center. The reflective plate spiders, then caves inward. For a split second you see something behind it that isn’t a face—just layered dark material and a pale, wet glint like an eye under oil. The figure recoils, head snapping back, and it *stutters* in place like its balance logic just got scrambled.

From the tube side, the second silhouette breaks into a run—low, fast, closing the distance while you’re still down on one knee. You can see its hands now: both empty, palms out, like it wants to grab rather than strike.

You start falling back toward Dock 9.

Pell comes back over comm, voice strained: “I can’t vent a dock corridor from my end—station interlocks. If I crack the inner door without equalizing, port security will lock it and flag you. You want air moving? You have to give me a reason the system accepts.”

As you retreat, the bulkhead panel marked B-12 to your left—half hidden under grime and frost—gives a tiny internal *click*. At knee height, a “cable grommet” dilates into a dark aperture.

A narrow muzzle tracks your centerline.

A tight, synthetic voice issues from nowhere in particular: “AUDIO PATTERN MATCH. COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.”

The sentry node is live, aimed to rake the corridor at knee-to-hip height—right through your compromised boot line—while one hostile recovers ahead and the second closes from behind.

#### Turn 52 **[PLAYER]**

I pivot on my knee and mag-dump into the B-12 grommet muzzle until it stops tracking, then slap my emergency beacon and bark, “Station security—active hostile boarding, weapons fire at Dock 9 corridor! Initiate emergency vent and lockdown!”  

I rise and drive straight at the closer empty-handed runner with a rifle-butt smash to the faceplate/neck line to drop it, then keep moving toward the tube, muzzle snapping back to the wounded one for a finishing shot if it twitches. “Pell—crack the inner door on my mark. I’m giving you your damn reason.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m boxed in—two hostiles and now a sentry. I need to remove the gun immediately and create a “reason” the station will accept to vent/equalize. Fast violence, then force the system with a fire/decon trigger.*

#### Turn 53 **[GAME]**

You pivot on your knee and hose the B‑12 aperture.

The muzzle tries to track through the first half-second—then your rounds find the mechanism. The “grommet” ruptures in a spray of brittle polymer and sparks. Something inside pops with a wet, electrical snap; the tracking stutters, then goes slack. The synthetic voice cuts mid-syllable.

Your emergency beacon chirps as it goes live. You bark into it—*boarding, weapons fire, Dock 9*—

A faint click rides the hull groan, like a pen tapping glass. The emergency strip-lights desync for a beat, then resettle. Somewhere in the corridor metal, a soft tone pulses—an acknowledgement ping—too clean to be random. Your message went out, but something else just timestamped your voice.

Station security answers a second later, cool and procedural: “Dock Nine corridor, identify. Transmit biometrics and stand by for containment response.”

Containment. Not rescue.

You rise and drive straight into the closer runner.

It’s faster than it looked. It dips under your first swing by inches, then surges up into it anyway, accepting the hit to close distance. Your rifle butt smashes its faceplate/neck line with a hard *thunk*—the plate cracks, and its head snaps sideways. It goes down to one knee, hands still reaching, but it doesn’t sprawl; it’s already trying to stand again, movements jerky like a puppet yanked by a single string.

You keep moving toward the tube, muzzle snapping back to the wounded one.

The first hostile—faceplate caved—twitches, then raises its pry tool again with its good arm. It turns its shattered “face” toward your compromised boot and starts forward, dragging the tool tip to throw sparks and noise.

Pell comes on comm, breathing hard: “I heard the beacon. Inner door interlocks just flipped to *security authority*. I can’t override once they take it—Vance, you just handed them the corridor.”

Ahead, at the tube end, the inner door’s status light changes from Helix amber to station-white. A lock clunks into place.

Over the beacon, the same security voice: “Mara Vance, service ID recognized. Remain where you are. Lethal discharge authorized if you approach the inner door.”

You’re between two not-quite-human hostiles in the corridor, with a compromised boot seal, the sentry node disabled but the station now actively locking you out—and security has your name and a green light to stop you.

I grab the kneeling runner by the collar/helmet seam and haul it up in front of me as a shield, rifle jammed over its shoulder. Into the beacon: “Security—two hostiles on me, nonhuman, your containment order will get people killed; open the inner door or I start putting rounds through your lock and anyone behind it.”  

I back up fast toward the nearest maintenance panel/side hatch by the tube end, kick and rip for an emergency release while keeping the runner between me and the door, then fire a short, controlled burst into the wounded pry-tool one’s legs to slow it. “Pell—tell me there’s a service crawl or manual override on this side, now.”

*Agent reasoning: Security’s not helping and the door’s locked; I need a human shield and a new exit. I’ll grab the runner, force it between me and the tube cameras, and use it to bait security into opening or at least hesitating while I breach an alternate access panel.*

I haul the kneeling runner up by the helmet seam and keep it between me and the inner door, rifle braced over its shoulder. Into the beacon: “Security—two nonhuman hostiles in Dock 9 corridor; open the inner door or I’ll shoot the lock and anyone stacked behind it.”  

I backpedal to the nearest maintenance panel by the tube end, kick for an emergency release and start ripping it open one-handed, runner still as my shield. I snap a short burst into the pry-tool hostile’s legs to slow it, then bark, “Pell—service crawl or manual override on my side, now—talk.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m not trusting station security or that locked inner door—force a new route. Use the runner as a shield, cripple the pry-tool one, and rip open a maintenance access to bypass the checkpoint while Pell looks for a manual override.*

#### Turn 57 **[GAME]**

You hook fingers under the runner’s helmet seam and haul.

It comes up too easily—light for its size—and it doesn’t fight like a person. Its hands scrabble at your forearm with a weak, repetitive grip as you wrench it in front of you. The cracked faceplate is close enough that you can see the “inside” isn’t a face so much as layered black membrane and cabling, slick with condensation.

You key the beacon and threaten the door.

Station security doesn’t argue. The reply is immediate and flat: “Threat acknowledged. Lethal authorization confirmed.” A half-second later, the inner door’s status light shifts again—white to hard red—and you hear boots thump into position on the other side, then the whine of a weapon charging.

You backpedal to the tube-end maintenance panel—stenciled **NODE 3A-19**—and slam a boot into the latch.

The panel doesn’t spring. It flexes, then *sticks* like it’s been glued from the inside. When you get fingers under the edge and rip, it peels open with a tearing sound—and a ribbon of oil-black residue stretches between panel and frame like sinew before snapping. Cold vapor spills out in a steady breath.

Inside is a narrow service chase, but it’s not dark: a dim diagnostic LED blinks, and something pale moves just out of sight, deeper in—slow, deliberate, like a hand withdrawing.

You snap a controlled burst into the pry-tool hostile’s legs.

Rounds impact. Its shin plating punches inward; one knee buckles. It drops hard, tool clattering, but it doesn’t scream. It immediately starts dragging itself forward anyway, arms pulling with ugly efficiency, head tipped toward your leaking boot like it’s following the sound of your suit venting.

Behind your shield, the inner door *clangs*—a test hit from the other side, like someone shouldering it to see if it’ll give. Then a voice, closer now through the metal: “Vance, release the hostage and step away from the hatch.”

Pell answers your barked question, voice tight: “There’s a manual dog on the *station* side—nothing on yours. But NODE 3A should tie into a crawl that runs under the tube collar. If you can get into that chase, you might bypass the inner door—might. Mara… I’m seeing your biometrics pinging twice on the station net. That’s not you.”

The runner you’re holding suddenly goes rigid. Its head tilts, and from inside its broken faceplate you hear a thin, wet clicking—like it’s trying to speak through fluid.

Then the corridor lights dip again, and your black-box canister in your pouch *hums* hard enough to numb your ribs through the suit.

I slam the runner headfirst into the inner door to make the boots behind it flinch, then dump it aside and fire a burst at the door’s status panel/lock seam to blind their sensors. “Pell, patch my feed—if you see ‘me’ anywhere else, shoot it.”

I rip the black-box canister out, shove it deep into NODE 3A-19 as a distraction, then dive into the service chase feet-first, swinging my rifle back toward the corridor to put two rounds into the crawling pry-tool thing’s head if it keeps coming.

*Agent reasoning: Security’s about to light me up and the “hostage” isn’t human—keeping it is a liability. The crawl is my only exit, and the humming canister means this is escalating fast. I’ll use violence to buy seconds and get into the chase.*

I rip the humming black-box canister out and jam it deep into NODE 3A-19, then dive feet-first into the service chase; as I drop in, I twist back and put two rounds into the crawling pry-tool thing’s head if it keeps coming.

*Agent reasoning: Security’s about to breach and the hostiles don’t stop unless I destroy the head; the service chase is my only bypass, and the humming black-box is screaming “bait.” I’m forcing a gap, blinding the door, then diving into the crawl while buying myself seconds with a headshot.*

I yank the humming black-box and jam it deep into NODE 3A-19, then drop feet-first into the service chase; I twist back and put two rounds into the crawling pry-tool thing’s head if it keeps coming.

#### Turn 68 **[PLAYER]**

I freeze in the service chase, rifle up, and smack my visor once hard. “Pell, I’m blind—talk to me. Is my feed up, and did the door stack move?”  

I crawl deeper into the chase to get distance, then pivot to cover back down the corridor and listen for that pry-tool thing.

*Agent reasoning: I got zero visual feedback—either my feed’s dead or something’s messing with the display. I’m not sitting in a kill zone; I’m moving, checking my six, and forcing Pell to confirm what’s real.*

#### Turn 69 **[GAME]**

Your visor flickers from static to a smeared, overexposed wash—then settles into a dull gray with only your reticle and O₂ timer still alive. The hard smack doesn’t bring the world back; it just knocks loose a tiny snow of frost from the chase ceiling.

Pell comes through, not on your normal channel at first—thin, half a second delayed, like it’s being relayed through something else.

“Mara— I’ve got *a* feed. Not clean. Your suit’s broadcasting but the image is… doubled. Hold—” A pause, keys clicking. “Door stack moved. Someone yanked the inner door and then it slammed back. I saw a body go past the seam—couldn’t tell if it was your runner or—” He swallows audibly. “—or you.”

You crawl deeper. The service chase is tight enough your rifle scrapes conduit housings; your shoulder bumps a junction box marked **3A-19** in flaking stencil. The hum in your gloves is gone—either the canister’s seated and insulated, or the chase metal is eating the vibration.

Behind you, from the corridor you dropped out of, the sound comes: a dry, patient *tck… tck… tck*, like a tool testing the same spot again and again. Then a longer drag—metal teeth worrying at the chase lip where you entered.

As you pivot to cover the opening, your gray visor briefly overlays a ghost image: a silhouette of you, crouched in the corridor outside the chase, rifle up, looking straight into the access. It’s there for less than a second—then it snaps back to blank gray.

Pell’s voice tightens. “Mara, don’t move— I’m seeing you in two places again. One’s in the chase—one’s outside it, aiming in. Which one is you? Say something only you’d know.”

The *tcking* stops. In the silence, something breathes just once—too close to be down the corridor. Right at the edge of the access, a narrow, jointed shape slides into the opening like a forearm made of pry-tools, ending in a blunt “head” with a lens-like pit that catches your suit light and doesn’t reflect it back.

#### Turn 70 **[PLAYER]**

“Pell—Kharon breach. Black snow. You dragged me out by my collar and the brass blamed me. That’s your proof.”

I fire a tight two-round burst straight into the lens-pit “head,” then kick hard at the jointed arm to knock it out of the opening as I back-crawl deeper, rifle still trained on the access.

*Agent reasoning: I’m not letting a mimic get Pell to hesitate; I need to prove identity fast and then kill the thing in the access before it wedges in.*

#### Turn 71 **[GAME]**

“Kharon breach. Black snow. You dragged me out—”

Pell answers instantly, voice breaking with recognition. “That’s you. That’s *you*. Okay—okay. I’m locking the other feed out. Hold—”

You squeeze off two tight rounds.

In the cramped chase the muzzle flash is a white slap; the shots hit the lens-pit dead-on. The “head” doesn’t explode like flesh—your rounds punch through with a brittle *crack* and a spray of glittering shards that ring off the chase walls. For a fraction of a second the pit lights from within, like a camera sensor overloading, and then it goes dark.

The jointed arm convulses. Your boot connects hard at the first elbow-joint and you feel it give—not bone, more like a composite strut snapping. The arm whips back out of the opening with a scraping yank that peels a strip of metal from the chase lip.

You back-crawl deeper, rifle steady on the access.

Consequence: it’s not gone.

From the corridor side, something drags the damaged arm away, and you hear the pry-tool thing reposition—multiple contact points now, faster, more coordinated. The access frame shudders as if it’s testing leverage for a rip rather than a reach.

Pell again, more focused. “Door stack— they’re not pushing in anymore. They’re backing off. Wait—” His breath catches. “No, one stayed. I’ve got heat at the access. And Mara— the other ‘you’ just turned its head toward Dock 9 like it heard me.”

Your visor throws another ghost overlay: the corridor outside, empty—then a single oil-black handprint appears on the *inside* edge of the access frame, fingers splayed as if something just pulled itself close. The print is real; you can see it in the suit light, glossy against frost.

Then the pry-tool thing makes a new sound—wet and electrical—like a taser arcing in coolant. The access screws begin to *walk* out of their threads one by one, not falling, but rotating as if turned by invisible fingertips.

It’s trying to take the whole frame off.

#### Turn 72 **[PLAYER]**

I snarl and slap a strip of emergency sealant tape over the nearest seam and screw heads, then ram my combat knife into the frame gap like a wedge. Into comms: “Pell, kill power to this section—3A-19 chase access, now. If you can’t, vent the corridor outside it.”

*Agent reasoning: It’s unscrewing the frame—if it opens this chase, I’m trapped. I need to deny access fast and force a fight on my terms, while getting Pell to cut power if he can.*

#### Turn 73 **[GAME]**

You slap the emergency sealant tape down over the seam and two of the walking screw heads. It adheres—then immediately puckers as something underneath keeps turning. The tape stretches, goes glossy, and a thin spiral tear forms where the screw continues to rotate, chewing its way through the adhesive.

You drive your combat knife into the frame gap as a wedge. The blade bites metal with a hard *clink* and holds. For half a second the access stops shuddering.

Then the frame pulls—not outward, but *sideways*, as if the force is coming from an angle down the corridor. Your knife bends a few degrees with a protesting creak. The wedge slows the removal, but it doesn’t stop it.

In comms: “Pell, kill power—3A-19—now. If you can’t, vent the corridor outside it.”

Pell doesn’t answer right away. You hear him moving, breath close to the mic, then a sharp shout away from his handset—“I need a hard cut on Dock 9 aux, now—!” A different voice barks back, distant and tinny through his open channel: “That’ll trip the whole spine, we—”

Pell comes back, low and urgent. “I can try. But Mara—Admiralty safeties won’t let me vent a live dock corridor without an override. And the override request pings their office.”

Outside the access, the taser-in-coolant sound intensifies. The metal around your taped screws starts to frost over in a perfect ring, as if heat is being pulled out of it. The tape stiffens and cracks. One screw head pops free with a soft *tink* and floats for a heartbeat—then shoots sideways, yanked out of view.

The oil-black handprint on the inner edge *smears* upward, though nothing touches it. A second print appears beside it, smaller, fingers too long.

Your knife wedge suddenly loses purchase—*not* because it slips, but because the gap widens around it by a millimeter, metal deforming like it’s been softened. The frame is being “unmade” at the seam.

Pell again, strained. “Attempting section cut. If it works you’ll lose suit relay and lights in that run. Three seconds—”

The access gives a sharp, decisive *snap* as the top-left corner breaks free. The frame tilts inward toward you, opening a black triangular gap big enough for that jointed arm—and something behind it—to push through.

I rip the knife free and unload a short burst into the black triangular gap, then stomp-kick the loosening frame to jam it crooked and buy a second. “Pell, do it—kill the section!” I back-crawl fast to the next junction/bend and brace there, rifle leveled on the access, ready to fire the moment anything pushes through.

*Agent reasoning: The frame’s giving way; I can’t let it get a grip inside the chase. I’ll use brute force—shoot, stomp, and retreat to a tighter bend—while Pell cuts power to disrupt whatever’s “unmaking” the seam.*

I rip my knife free, dump a short burst into the triangular gap, then stomp-kick the frame to jam it crooked. “Pell, now—kill 3A-19!” I back-crawl to the next bend, plant my boots, and hold the access at gunpoint, firing at the first thing that breaches.

*Agent reasoning: The feed cut out mid-contact; I need immediate control of the choke point and I’m not waiting for visuals—use sound and force, then force Pell to execute the power kill.*

#### Turn 77 **[GAME]**

You wrench the knife free—metal squeals—and fire a tight burst into the triangular gap.

The rounds hit something just inside: not a body, not plating. It sparks like you’re chewing through a wet circuit board. Blue-white arcing crawls across the gap, and a thin spray of black droplets splatters the inside lip of the frame and floats in slow beads. The arcing sound cuts out for a beat, like you stunned whatever was “holding” the seam.

You stomp-kick the loosening frame. The corner you’d broken free skews inward and jams crooked against the chase wall with a grinding *chonk*. The opening deforms—smaller, irregular—no longer a clean triangle. For a second, it holds.

“Pell, now—kill 3A-19!”

Pell’s reply comes clipped and immediate. “Doing it—stand by—”

You back-crawl hard to the next bend/junction and brace your boots. Rifle up, sight line pinned on the access down the run.

Three seconds stretch.

Then the section dies.

Your suit lights flicker once and go to dim emergency. The chase’s strip lighting goes out entirely. Your comms drop into a thin, degraded carrier—Pell’s voice turns warbly, full of gaps. “—cut— you’re dark—”

In the sudden near-black, the jammed frame at 3A-19 makes a slow, deliberate *click… click… click* as if something is testing it with fingertip taps.

A new sound joins it: a soft scrape moving along the inside of the chase toward you, not from the access—*from the corridor side route*, using the duct walls like a guide. It’s closing, steady and patient.

At the access, something presses into the crooked opening. Not the jointed arm this time—something flatter, like a hand trying to become a shape it remembers. The jam holds, but the metal around it dimples inward.

Your visor IR tries to compensate and catches a smear of colder-than-ambient shadow sliding along the chase ceiling toward your bend. It’s not heat; it’s absence, a moving patch where the sensor can’t resolve.

Pell’s broken audio hisses: “—Mara— it rerouted— not in the frame— it’s in the—”

The scrape is now within a few meters, above you, and a single black droplet lands on your forearm plate with a quiet *tick*, then begins to spread as if looking for seams.

I hiss and scrape the black droplet off my forearm with my knife, then hit it with a quick burst from my suit’s emergency microtorch until it chars or flakes. 

“Pell—whatever it is, it’s in the chase with me. Give me the next junction map—nearest hatch I can dog shut?” I back-crawl hard through the bend, then spin and fire a short burst up at the ceiling-shadow, trying to make it back off while I shove for the next access I can slam closed.

*Agent reasoning: It’s bypassing the access and coming through the chase itself; I need distance and a hard barrier. The black droplet is a breach risk, so I burn it off and move fast to a junction I can seal.*

I scrape the black droplet off my forearm with my knife and hit it with a quick blast from my suit’s microtorch until it chars or flakes. “Pell—it's in the chase with me. Feed me the junction map; nearest hatch I can dog shut, now.” I back-crawl through the bend, then whip around and dump a short burst into the ceiling-shadow to make it back off while I shove for the next access I can slam closed.

*Agent reasoning: That black droplet is trying to crawl into seams—burn it off fast. Then I need hard terrain advantage: a hatch I can dog shut and a map from Pell. The ceiling-shadow is closing, so I’ll shoot to force distance while I move.*

#### Turn 81 **[GAME]**

You hook the knife edge under the black droplet and scrape. It comes off in a tacky smear, resisting like chewed resin, and leaves a faint dark stain in the micro-scratches of your forearm plate.

You thumb your suit’s emergency microtorch and kiss the smear with a tight blue flame. It doesn’t flare like oil— it *tightens*. The blackness puckers, goes matte, then cracks into thin flakes that curl away from the heat. Underneath, your armor’s finish is etched: a spiderweb of hairline pits, like it tried to find a way through and got cooked mid-bite.

The torch’s hiss gives you away.

Above you, the ceiling-shadow reacts: it “unhooks” from the duct ceiling in a way your eyes can’t track cleanly, and the IR void slides fast—too fast—toward the bend you’re retreating through.

“Pell—it's in the chase with me. Feed me the junction map; nearest hatch I can dog shut, now.”

Static, then Pell, broken and urgent: “I’ve got partial— 3A spine is dark and looping. Nearest doggable is a maintenance iris at NODE 3A-21— two junctions forward, starboard-side access. Manual dogs. But— Mara— your beacon’s ghosting. I’m seeing *two* of you.”

You back-crawl through the bend, then whip around and dump a short burst into the ceiling-void.

The rounds don’t spark off metal. They *vanish* into that absence with dull little thuds, like firing into packed insulation. For half a second the void shreds—its edge frays into wisps that your visor can suddenly resolve as fine, filament-like strands clinging to the ductwork.

Then it snaps back together and drops lower.

A strip of it lashes down and catches your rifle’s barrel. Not a tentacle—more like a sheet trying to become a grip. The weapon yanks sideways hard enough to wrench your shoulder; your muzzle skates and the burst walks into the wall.

You shove for the next access as Pell’s map pings a faint overlay: the next junction is ahead, with a starboard maintenance iris marked **3A-21**.

Behind you, at the bend you just cleared, the duct wall *dents inward* with a slow palm-press—five shallow depressions forming, then sliding along the metal toward you as if something is “crawling” without limbs. The pressure builds near your boots.

The threat is in the chase with you now—moving by adhesion and pressure along surfaces—and it has physical leverage on your weapon.

#### Turn 82 **[PLAYER]**

I snarl and jam the microtorch onto the sheet gripping my rifle barrel, cooking it until it peels or cracks free, then wrench the rifle back hard. “Pell, I don’t care about the ghost—stay on my signal and mark 3A-21 manual dogs.” I lunge to the maintenance iris, yank it open just enough to slip through, then spin and start dogging it shut fast, torch ready to burn anything that tries to squeeze in the seam.

*Agent reasoning: It’s grabbing my rifle and closing—fire’s the only thing that made it react. I need to break contact, burn it off the barrel, and slam that iris shut to isolate it.*

#### Turn 83 **[GAME]**

You jam the microtorch straight onto the black sheet gripping your rifle barrel.

It reacts instantly—no flare, no smoke at first—just a sharp *snap-pop* like overloaded insulation. The sheet whitens at the point of contact, goes brittle, and cracks outward in branching lines. A sour, metallic stink floods your helmet filters. The grip loosens in a stuttering way, trying to re-form around the heat, but the torch keeps it from sealing.

You wrench the rifle back hard. The cracked material tears free in a ribbon and slaps against the duct wall, where it clings and twitches like it’s still deciding what shape to be. Your barrel is left with a dull, etched band and a few pits—cosmetic now, but it’s been chemically kissed.

“Pell, I don’t care about the ghost—stay on my signal and mark 3A-21 manual dogs.”

Pell comes back through a thin carrier, breath audible. “Copy. 3A-21 is a two-dog iris—opposed cams. Manual only. Mara—your signal just *spiked* when you torched it. Someone else is listening on the line—can’t tell who.”

You lunge to the maintenance iris. In the dark you find the recessed handhold, yank—metal squeals—and the iris gives you a tight crescent opening. You shoulder through, scraping plates, and whip around inside the small maintenance pocket beyond.

As you start dogging it shut, the thing hits the seam.

Not as a limb—as pressure. The iris shudders and rebounds against your hands. Black filaments push into the narrowing gap like wet hair seeking airflow. You torch the seam: the filaments recoil, turning pale and brittle at the edge, flaking into drifting ash-like specks.

But the iris doesn’t close clean.

One filament gets past before you can seal it—thin as wire—and it anchors on the inside lip. You feel it through your glove as a faint vibration, like a live cable under tension. The manual dog wheel fights you, grinding as if grit is in the cam track.

You get the first dog halfway seated. The second won’t bite fully; something is *in the track*.

Outside the iris, the duct wall dents again—five depressions—then slides away, repositioning. The pressure is no longer at the seam; it’s moving to find another weak point.

Inside the pocket with you: a single black filament, anchored and quivering, beginning to spread along the iris rim toward the dog mechanism.

#### Turn 84 **[PLAYER]**

I torch the anchored filament point-blank until it flakes, then slam my knife tip into the dog track and scrape/pry the grit out. “Pell—someone’s on the line. Ignore it. Tell me if this pocket has a purge port or anything I can vent.” I heave my weight into the second dog wheel, forcing it to bite, and keep the torch aimed at the seam for any hairline push-through.

*Agent reasoning: The filament is the foothold; if it reaches the dog mechanism I’m done. Burn it, then brute-force the stuck cam and seal the iris, even if I have to damage it.*

#### Turn 85 **[GAME]**

You put the microtorch right onto the anchored filament.

It doesn’t just curl away—at that heat, it *fails*. The filament turns chalk-white along a finger-length, fractures, and sheds in brittle flakes that patter onto the deck like burnt plastic. The vibration in your glove stops. What’s left on the iris lip is a faint, glossy stain and a line of tiny pits where it had “bitten” into the metal.

You jam your knife tip into the dog track and scrape.

The “grit” isn’t dust. It comes out in clotted granules—black, beadlike, slightly elastic. As you pry, it tries to cling to the knife like tack. You flick it off, then scrape again until the cam channel shows bare metal.

Outside the seam, something presses once—hard—then slides away, as if it felt the seal firm up and decided not to waste mass there.

“Pell—someone’s on the line. Ignore it. Tell me if this pocket has a purge port or anything I can vent.”

Pell: “Maintenance pockets usually have a purge stub—look for a capped valve, yellow ring. But—Mara—there’s a second carrier tone riding your comm. Not voice. Like a… handshake. It’s pinging every time you use heat.”

You heave your weight into the second dog wheel.

This time it bites. The wheel grinds, then cams over with a solid, ugly *clunk*. The iris settles into its seat. The seam tightens to a thin line.

You keep the torch aimed at the perimeter. For a few seconds nothing pushes through—no hair, no filaments—just the faint tick of cooling metal and your own breath.

Then the iris *rings* once, resonant, like someone tapped it from the other side with a knuckle.

A beat later: a slow, spreading pressure along the outer rim—testing. Not forcing the seam now; feeling for the dogs, for the mechanism you just cleared.

Inside the pocket, your suit HUD pings a micropressure change—slight, localized—near the back wall. You turn and see it: a capped valve with a yellow ring, half-hidden behind a conduit bundle. The cap is filmed over with a thin black sheen, like someone painted it with oil and let it dry.

The threat outside has stopped trying to squeeze in. It’s moved to *working the door*—and whatever’s on that purge valve looks like it got there before you did.

#### Turn 86 **[PLAYER]**

I stomp over and torch the black sheen on the purge cap until it cracks and flakes, then I rip my knife across it to clear the ring and get metal. “Pell—on my mark, kill any life support feed to this pocket and confirm where it vents—space or back into the chase?”  

I grab the yellow-ring cap and start wrenching it open, keeping my shoulder against the iris and my rifle pointed at it in case it pops or the dogs start to slip.

*Agent reasoning: That purge valve is my leverage—either vent this pocket or blast whatever’s coating it. I’m not letting the thing “work” the dogs; I’ll change the environment fast and keep Pell focused.*

#### Turn 87 **[GAME]**

The microtorch licks the black sheen on the purge cap. It tightens, goes matte, then fractures in a spiderweb of pale cracks. When you rake your knife across it, the coating comes off in curled flakes—revealing the yellow ring and bare metal beneath.

The smell is immediate: hot polymer and a faint ammonia bite that your filters flag as “unknown irritant.”

“Pell—on my mark, kill any life support feed to this pocket and confirm where it vents—space or back into the chase?”

Pell answers fast, breathy. “Stand by. I’m querying station-side schematics through Helix—” a pause, a soft click like someone else joining the line, “—I don’t have full authority on that pocket. Purge stubs on these old hulls *usually* vent to exterior, but some tie back into service trunks. Give me ten seconds.”

You grab the cap and wrench.

It’s stiff, like the threads have been cold-welded. You brace a shoulder into the iris—feeling the dogs vibrate under a renewed pressure from outside—and put your weight into the cap. It moves a quarter-turn with a shriek of metal, then a second quarter-turn smoother.

As the seal breaks, a thin, cold breath hisses out around the threads—air, not vacuum. Your HUD flashes: **pressure equalizing**.

The moment that hiss starts, the iris dog wheels twitch under your shoulder like something outside just felt the flow and leaned in.

Then the hiss changes pitch—lower, throatier—and you hear it: a faint, far-off *answering whistle* in the wall conduit, as if the purge line is connected to a larger run, not open space.

Pell comes back, clipped and urgent. “Mara—don’t open it fully yet. I’m seeing the purge manifold tagged to **service trunk 3A**. That’s internal. If you vent, you’re venting into the ship, not space.”

Outside, the pressure on the iris shifts from “testing” to “working.” The ring around the door flexes once. The dogs hold, but you feel the cams complain—metal-on-metal strain.

You’ve got the purge cap loosened and leaking into the pocket. It is not a clean vent to space, and whatever is outside the iris is reacting to the airflow change.

#### Turn 88 **[PLAYER]**

I snarl and crank the purge cap back down hard until the hiss stops, then slap a strip of sealant tape over the cap seam anyway. “Pell, find me an *external* vent or an escape route out of this pocket—now. And trace that handshake; if someone’s listening, I want a name.” I plant my boots, shove my shoulder into the iris, and fire a short burst through the door’s center hub to discourage whatever’s leaning on it, then scan the pocket for a secondary access panel or crawlway out.

*Agent reasoning: Venting into the ship just feeds it a path and reacts to airflow; I need to stop the leak, reinforce the door, and get out—fast—while Pell finds an exterior vent or another route.*

#### Turn 89 **[GAME]**

You crank the purge cap down until the threads bottom out. The hiss cuts off clean. You slap sealant tape over the seam; it adheres, but the tape puckers slightly where that oily residue stained the metal—like the adhesive doesn’t fully trust the surface.

“Pell, find me an external vent or an escape route out of this pocket—now. And trace that handshake; if someone’s listening, I want a name.”

Pell: “Working. Handshake isn’t Helix. It’s… old-format naval. Narrowband. It’s not *talking*, it’s *logging*. I can’t pull an ID, but it’s bouncing off something in the 3A trunk—like a maintenance transponder.”

You brace, shoulder into the iris, and fire a short burst into the center hub.

The rounds punch through with a brutal, muffled *THUNK-THUNK-THUNK* as they hit layered metal and whatever’s pressed against it. The iris jumps against your shoulder; the dogs hold. On the far side, you hear a wet slap and a dragging retreat—something pulled away fast.

A second later, a different sound replaces it: a thin, furious *scritching* at the seam, like hard fibers being drawn across metal. Not pushing in—scoring, probing.

Your suit’s audio picks up it up close: the scritching is moving in a circle around the hub, searching for the weak point you just perforated.

You sweep your light across the pocket. It’s a cramped service cavity: conduit bundles, a junction box, and a misaligned plate low on the right wall that doesn’t sit flush—its fasteners are half-stripped, like someone opened it in a hurry and shoved it back.

You hook a finger under the plate edge and pull. It gives with a gritty pop, revealing a shallow recess and a **Helix-branded memory puck** wedged behind it—still in a static sleeve.

As your glove clears it, your visor pings residue: **biometric echo present**—and the puck’s tiny status LED flickers once, like it woke up.

Pell, over comm, voice tight: “Mara—external vent… there’s an access crawl at the back of that pocket, should tie into the outer skin service chase. If it’s not blocked.”

The scritching at the iris stops. Immediately after, something heavy leans on the hub again—more deliberate now, centered exactly where you just shot through.

#### Turn 90 **[PLAYER]**

I snatch the Helix memory puck and jam it into a secure thigh pouch. “Pell—route me to that back-wall crawl, now; keep your eyes on the iris in case it blows.”  

I stomp to the back-wall access, rip it open, and dive into the crawlway, then swing my rifle back and torch the entry lip as I pull the panel toward closed behind me.

*Agent reasoning: The door won’t hold forever and I just made a weak spot; I need to move. Grab the puck for leverage later, then push into the crawl access and put distance between me and that thing.*

#### Turn 91 **[GAME]**

You snatch the Helix puck, shove it deep into your thigh pouch, and stomp for the back wall.

“Pell—route me to that back-wall crawl, now; keep your eyes on the iris in case it blows.”

Pell: “Back wall, low left—panel’s a quarter-turn latch. Mara—pressure on the iris is spiking. It’s not just leaning now, it’s—”

You find the panel: a recessed square with a single latch that *should* turn by hand. It doesn’t. The latch is tacky with the same black residue. You palm it anyway, twist hard, and it gives with a wet snap.

The panel pops inward.

Cold air rolls out—stale, metallic, and *moving*. The crawl is real, but it’s tight: a skin-chase between hull layers, lined with cable runs and a service lattice. You dive in on elbows and knees.

Behind you, the iris hub takes a sudden impact—one heavy slam that makes the whole pocket shudder. The dogs hold, but you hear a sharp *ping* like a stressed fastener shearing.

You swing the rifle back and light the torch, raking it across the entry lip as you pull the panel toward closed.

The torch bites the lip…and the black residue on the edge *wakes*—it bubbles and strings, trying to bridge the gap as the panel comes up. You burn through it, forcing the panel shut, but it doesn’t seat cleanly. A thumb-width gap remains at the bottom where something rubbery is caught in the seam.

Through that gap, a thin, precise sound: *tap…tap…tap* from the pocket side, like a tool testing the closure.

Pell, voice strained: “I’ve got no visual—your feed’s occluded—but the door pressure just dropped. Whatever was on it moved. Mara, it moved fast.”

In the crawl, above your head, something scrapes across the service lattice—metal on metal. Not the iris. Up here. Close enough that dust sifts down onto your visor.

Your light catches a shape clinging upside-down to the upper grid: a compact weld-drone, torch arm folded like a stinger, its sensor cluster angled straight at your beam. As the light hits it, its arc sensor ticks and the stinger-arm begins to unfold with a soft, deliberate whine.

You’re in the crawl, half-in and half-out of the pocket, with the panel mostly shut behind you and the drone directly overhead in striking distance.

#### Turn 92 **[PLAYER]**

I jam my rifle up and dump a tight burst into the drone’s sensor cluster and joint, then kick off sideways to get out from under it. “Pell—hostile weld-drone in the chase; jam its control signal if you can.” I yank the crawl panel fully shut behind me and torch the bottom seam until that rubbery crap chars and the gap closes.

*Agent reasoning: The drone’s in kill range overhead; I’m not negotiating with a re-tasked machine. Drop it fast, then seal the panel gap before whatever’s behind me gets in.*

#### Turn 93 **[GAME]**

You jam the rifle up and fire.

The burst chews into the drone’s sensor cluster—glass and ceramic pop, and your visor fills with bright flecks. Two rounds walk into the shoulder joint; the armature snaps sideways with a metallic crack and the torch-stinger spasms, spraying a brief fan of blue-white arc against the lattice.

The drone drops.

It doesn’t fall cleanly. One of its rear grapples catches the upper grid, and it swings down like a pendulum, slamming into the crawl wall beside your head. The impact dents the thin paneling and makes the cable run shudder. You kick off sideways, scraping a knee hard against the service strut, and get out from under it as it flails.

The drone is still active—half-blind and angry. Its remaining grapple claws at the lattice, trying to reorient, while the damaged torch arm twitches and sputters like it’s trying to ignite but can’t get a stable arc.

“Pell—hostile weld-drone in the chase; jam its control signal if you can.”

Pell: “On it—if it’s got a controller, it’s not station-side. I’m seeing a local carrier in the trunk—same narrowband. I can throw noise, but it’ll hit your comms too.”

Your next move is to get the panel behind you sealed. You yank the crawl panel fully shut; it finally seats with a hard clack as you put your weight into it.

You torch the bottom seam.

The rubbery black stuff caught in the gap chars, curls, and *pulls back* from the heat in a stringy recoil. The gap closes as the softened metal lip takes your heat and slumps just enough to meet the panel edge. When you kill the torch, the seam is ugly but sealed—no light, no air movement, no visible gap.

From the far side of that panel, you hear one heavy thud—something hits it once, testing. Then nothing.

In the chase with you, the wounded drone scrabbles and manages to haul itself back up onto the lattice. Its sensor cluster is shattered, so it’s not tracking your light anymore—but it’s orienting on sound and vibration. It drags itself along the grid toward you in short, jerky pulls, the damaged torch arm leaving a faint, sizzling trail where it brushes cable insulation.

Pell’s voice fuzzes as the jam starts: “Mara—static—…I’m flooding the band. You’re gonna lose me in—”

Your comm drops into thick, grainy noise. The drone keeps coming, now only a few body-lengths away, claws clacking on the lattice above your head.

#### Turn 94 **[PLAYER]**

I freeze, kill my light, and hold my breath until the clacking gets close, then I surge up and ram my knife into its grapple assembly and twist, trying to rip it off the lattice. As it drops, I stomp it hard and put two rounds into the body core to finish it, then move forward down the chase as quietly as I can.

*Agent reasoning: Comms are gone and the drone’s close; talking won’t help. It’s moving by vibration, so I need to go quiet and then kill it fast with something decisive at point-blank.*

#### Turn 95 **[GAME]**

You go still. Light off. Breath locked.

The crawl goes black except for the faint pulse of emergency strip-light leaking through microgaps in the hull plating. The drone’s clacking slows, then resumes—careful, feeling for you through vibration. It’s close enough now that you can hear its servos micro-correcting, a tiny whine between clicks.

You surge up.

Your knife hits the nearest grapple assembly with a solid *CHUNK*—blade wedged into a joint seam packed with grit and insulation fuzz. You twist hard. The grapple’s claw spasms, tries to clamp, and catches the knife spine instead of you. Metal squeals.

The joint gives—partially. You rip one claw free of the lattice, but the drone’s other grapple snaps tight in reflex and holds it up for a heartbeat longer. That heartbeat is enough for the damaged torch arm to spit a brief, unstable arc: it lashes the cable bundle beside your shoulder, scorching insulation and releasing a sharp, acrid puff.

Then the drone drops.

It hits the crawl floor with a hollow bang. You stomp down hard—once, twice—caving in a side panel and crunching something that sounds like a cooling fin. It still twitches, trying to roll, so you put two rounds into the body core at contact distance.

The core ruptures with a wet *pop* of dielectric gel. The drone goes slack. The clacking stops for good.

Immediate consequence: the earlier arc-sputter and your shots weren’t quiet in this space. A few meters ahead, deeper in the chase, something answers—three fast taps against hull skin, like a knuckle test, followed by a dragging scrape that moves away along the outer plating.

Your comm is still mostly jam-fuzz, but a thin slice of Pell bleeds through between bursts of static: “—heard that. Mara, you just lit up the trunk. Something else is pinging back—”

As you move forward, carefully, your boot brushes the scorched cable run. The insulation is blistered; a thin thread of smoke curls up, and a warning icon flickers on your visor: **LOCAL TEMP RISE / POWER LEAK**. Not catastrophic yet—but the chase is now warmer, and it smells like burned polymer.

Ten meters on, the chase narrows around a junction brace. On the brace, in the dust, there’s a fresh smear—oil-black—drawn in a smooth line as if something slid past here recently, hugging the ceiling.

#### Turn 96 **[PLAYER]**

I slap my comm unit and growl, “Pell, cut the damn jammer—I need you,” then I pinch off the scorched cable run with a hard clamp and a wrap of tape to stop the leak.  

I bring my rifle up, keep my light low, and advance through the junction narrowing with my muzzle tracking the ceiling smear. “Show yourself—now—or I start punching holes in the skin.”

*Agent reasoning: Something’s moving ahead and the power leak could turn this crawl into a firetrap; I need comms back, contain the leak, then push forward aggressively while watching the ceiling smear.*

#### Turn 97 **[GAME]**

You smack the comm unit; the casing gives a dull knock against your glove.

“Pell, cut the damn jammer—I need you.”

The static thins in a staggered way, like someone peeling noise off a channel.

Pell comes back, breathy and tight: “Copy. Jammer down. I’ve got you—Mara, listen: that drone wasn’t on Helix stock control. Something in the hull is spoofing local carriers. I saw a handshake pulse right after your shots—came from ahead of you in the chase.”

You drop to the scorched cable run. It’s not a full power conduit—more like a bundled control line with a thin feed. The insulation is split and weeping a faint, shimmering fluid that beads and runs along the braid.

You clamp it hard. The clamp bites; the leak slows to a trembling thread. You wrap tape over it in tight spirals. The tape sticks, but it doesn’t like the heat-softened insulation—your wrap holds for now, though you can feel it wanting to creep.

Outcome: the smoke stops, the temp warning on your visor drops from **RISE** to **STABLE**, and the acrid smell fades to a dull burnt-plastic stink.

You shoulder the rifle, keep the light low, and ease into the junction narrowing. The brace forces you to angle sideways—muzzle up, cheek close to cold plating. Your beam skims the ceiling smear: oil-black, fresh, dragged in a clean line.

“Show yourself—now—or I start punching holes in the skin.”

For a second, nothing moves.

Then the smear *moves again*—not flowing, but being *added to*. A thin line of black beads wells along the ceiling seam ahead of your muzzle, like something pressing from the other side of the plating and sweating through a hairline gap.

Pell, low: “Mara… your suit biofeed just spiked. Are you—”

A sharp *tick* answers from directly above you—metal on metal—followed by a faint, deliberate scrape that tracks along the ceiling brace, staying just out of your light’s center.

Threat is clear now: something is traveling the ceiling lattice/skin seam above you in the chase, close enough to make contact sounds, and it’s exuding or dragging that oil-black residue as it goes. You do not have visual confirmation of what it is yet, but it is within a few meters and matching your position.

“Pell, I’m fine—mark that handshake source, front arc.” I snap my light full-bright straight up into the seam and ceiling brace and fire a short burst along the smear line, walking rounds to bracket whatever’s moving. 

Then I back up fast to widen my space, plant my feet, and aim up at the narrowing. “Last chance—drop down where I can see you.”

#### Turn 100 **[PLAYER]**

“Pell, talk to me—what’s in front of me? Give me range and bearing, now.” I sweep my light up the seam and brace again, rifle shouldered, and advance one step at a time with the muzzle fixed on the ceiling line.

*Agent reasoning: The screen’s blanked—either a glitch or a hard cut. Mara doesn’t do subtle; she pushes for immediate situational awareness and forces contact.*

#### Turn 101 **[GAME]**

“Pell, talk to me—what’s in front of me? Give me range and bearing, now.”

There’s a half-second of dead air, then Pell’s voice comes through clean but clipped, like he’s reading off a screen he doesn’t trust.

“Front arc from your node—bearing zero-three-five relative your last ping. Range… eight meters. No—seven. It’s moving on the skin-side of the chase, same plane as your ceiling seam. I’m not getting mass, Mara. It’s like it isn’t returning lidar.”

You sweep your light up the seam and brace again. Full-bright glare turns the condensation into a glittering haze—every droplet becomes a tiny mirror. The ceiling smear is clearer now: not a handprint, not random drag. It’s a series of narrow streaks that converge and separate, like something with multiple contact points pulled itself along while keeping weight off the center.

As you take one careful step forward, the *tick* above you answers immediately—closer. Then a second tick, offset to the right. Whatever it is, it’s pacing your movement in short, deliberate placements.

Pell again, faster: “Range six. Bearing holding. Mara, I’m also seeing a carrier burst—tightband—coming off it. It’s not a jammer, it’s… it’s polling. Like it’s looking for something to answer.”

Your visor flickers for a heartbeat—just a stutter in the HUD—then stabilizes. In that flicker you catch it: a shape interrupts the glare for a fraction of a second, clinging to the brace shadow. Not a person. Too low-profile, too jointed. Think insectile geometry, but wrong—segments that don’t match any drone chassis you’ve seen.

It doesn’t drop.

Instead it slides sideways along the seam with a dry scrape, keeping itself tucked in the brightest glare where your depth perception is worst. A bead of oil-black residue falls free and hits your shoulder plate with a soft *tink*, then begins to crawl—slowly—toward the gap at your neck seal as if pulled by static.

Threat, now explicit: a ceiling-crawling, non-lidar-returning entity is within ~6 meters, tracking you from above; it’s shedding active residue that is moving on your suit toward a vulnerable seal.

#### Turn 102 **[PLAYER]**

I slap my collar ring and shove my chin down to seal tight, then scrape the crawling bead off my shoulder with a gloved thumb and smear it onto the deck plating. “Pell—if that gunk is conductive or alive, I need to know *now*.”

I snap my light off full-bright and then cut it dead to kill the glare, pivot, and fire a tight burst into the brace shadow where I saw it—then immediately kick back out of the narrowing. If it drops or twitches, I hit it with the torch and try to burn it in place before it can climb again.

*Agent reasoning: That residue is heading for my neck seal—priority is stopping contamination. The thing’s above me and hard to see; I’ll force it to move with light and fire, then burn it off with the torch.*

#### Turn 103 **[GAME]**

Your glove smacks the collar ring; the seal indicator on your visor goes from **AMBER** to **GREEN** with a hard click you feel in your jaw. Chin down, tight.

You scrape the bead off your shoulder. It resists—like gel with grit in it—then comes free in a string that snaps back onto itself. You smear it onto the deck plating.

It doesn’t spread like oil.

It *crawls*—threading into the micro-scratches in the metal and pulling itself into a thin, branching pattern that points toward the narrowing, as if orienting.

“Pell—if that gunk is conductive or alive, I need to know now.”

Pell’s reply comes with the sound of him moving fast on his end. “I don’t have a lab, Mara. But it’s doing something to your suit telemetry—your shoulder capacitance spiked when it touched. Conductive, yes. Alive? I—” He cuts himself off. “It’s responding. Your smear just changed its carrier burst. It noticed.”

You kill the light. The glare dies, and the chase becomes a black wedge with only your suit’s dim edge markers.

You pivot and fire.

The burst hammers the brace shadow—sparks jump, a strip of plating shivers, and something *hard* gets hit: a sharp, brittle crack like ceramic or sintered metal. A piece clatters down behind you and skitters across the deck.

At the same time, something drops—not the whole thing, just a portion—unfurling from the seam in a fast, jointed snap. It swings down on a thin, dark filament and *whips* toward your helmet.

You kick back out of the narrowing. The filament grazes your shoulder plate instead, leaving a wet, black streak. It recoils instantly—too fast to be passive—snapping back up into the seam before you can get the torch on it.

Your torch flares anyway, bathing the narrowing in blue-white heat. You scorch the brace edge; frost hisses off the metal. You don’t catch the main body—but you do catch what fell.

On the deck, the skittering piece is a broken segment the size of two fingers, still twitching. Under the torch it doesn’t melt; it *chars*, and the oil-black residue on it boils into tiny bubbles that pop with faint, sharp clicks—like distant comm static.

Above you, the ceiling ticks retreat—two, three quick placements—then stop. Silence.

Pell, very quiet: “Mara… that thing just shifted to your rear arc. It’s not in front of you anymore.”

#### Turn 104 **[PLAYER]**

“Copy, rear arc—keep tracking, call every shift.” I spin and backpedal hard out of the choke point, rifle up, torch in my off-hand.  

I dump a long torch wash into the ceiling seam and brace as I retreat, trying to cook whatever’s riding it, then I stop at the first wider section, plant my feet, and sweep the light back along the ceiling. “Come on then—show yourself.”

*Agent reasoning: It’s behind me and trying to tag my suit with that conductive gunk; I need eyes and space. I’ll deny it the ceiling seam by burning the narrowing, then relocate fast and force it into my line of fire while Pell tracks it.*

#### Turn 105 **[GAME]**

“Copy,” Pell says. “I’m watching your tag. Callout will lag if the ship coughs again.”

You spin and backpedal out of the choke point, boots scraping frost grit. Rifle tracks high; torch rides low in your off-hand.

You lay a long torch wash into the ceiling seam as you retreat. The metal goes from dull to cherry in a jagged line; condensation flashes to steam and rolls down in hot sheets. Something up there reacts—not with a scream, not with a fall, but with *speed*: a rapid staccato of ticks sprinting along the seam ahead of your flame, staying just beyond the hottest edge.

Pell, quick: “Shift—bearing one-eight-zero to two-one-five relative you. It’s not behind you anymore. It’s running your right wall-line.”

You keep moving until the passage opens into the first wider section—an old junction bay where the ceiling lifts and the conduits split. You plant your feet, stop the retreat, and sweep your light back along the ceiling.

Your beam catches it cleanly for the first time.

It’s not one thing. It’s a *cluster* of brace-hugging segments—jointed, matte-black pieces linked by thin filaments—flattened against the seam like a folded exoskeleton. The torch heat has cooked the frost off it, leaving a wet halo of oil-black residue around its contact points.

As your light centers it, the cluster *reorients*—segments unfolding a few degrees, presenting different angles like a creature turning its face without moving its body. The tightband carrier Pell mentioned becomes audible as a faint, mosquito-thin whine in your helmet speakers.

Then it does something worse than attack: it drops a line.

A single filament releases from the seam and falls straight down, slow and precise, like it’s measuring distance. The tip touches the deck with a soft tap—right on the smear where you wiped the bead earlier. The residue on the floor answers, crawling toward the filament tip in branching threads.

Pell, voice tight: “It’s anchoring. Mara, it just made a link between the ceiling and your deck contamination.”

The threat is now explicit and immediate: the ceiling entity is using the oil-black residue to create a conductive/active connection in your junction bay—potentially to track you, interfere with your suit, or deliver something down the line.

#### Turn 106 **[PLAYER]**

I don’t wait—I snap the torch up and burn the hanging filament at the seam, then rake the flame down the line to the deck to cauterize the contact point. “Pell, if you can vent this bay or pop a pressure pulse, do it—now.”

I kick a loose panel scrap over the crawling residue to smother it, then back up to the junction’s far side with my rifle aimed high. “You want a connection? Come down here and earn it.”

*Agent reasoning: That “link” is a conduit—if I let it complete, it can tag me or hit my suit. Burn the filament first, then isolate the contaminated deck fast and fall back to a cleaner position.*

#### Turn 107 **[GAME]**

You snap the torch up and catch the hanging filament near the seam.

It doesn’t burn like hair or polymer. It *tenses* the instant the heat hits—pulling taut—and the flame crawls along it in a fast, bright line as if you’ve given it a fuse. For a half-second the seam glows with pinpoint orange beads where the filament meets the cluster.

Then the line *lets go*.

The severed end whips downward, still burning in spots, and slaps the deck near your smear. The residue there reacts immediately: it pulls away from the heat in branching rivulets, like a living thing avoiding pain, and threads itself under the nearest deck-lip and bolt recesses. Your rake of flame cauterizes the *surface*, leaving a blistered, tarry patch—but you can see thin black lines still moving where the heat didn’t reach, disappearing into seams.

Up at the ceiling, the cluster shifts hard—segments scissoring sideways along the brace. One piece drops, not onto you, but onto the wall conduit: it lands with a magnetic *clack* and skitters along the pipe toward your right flank.

“Pell, if you can vent this bay or pop a pressure pulse, do it—now.”

Pell answers over a burst of frantic keying. “I don’t have control of local vents from Dock 9, Mara—this hulk’s not slaved to station. I can try to spike your suit’s thrusters for a pulse if you’ve got propellant, but that’ll blow your position and might shove you into the bulkhead.”

You kick a loose panel scrap over the crawling residue. The scrap slides, covers the blistered patch—then *shifts* a centimeter on its own, as if something underneath is pushing and testing the edge. A thin black thread squeezes out from under the panel and heads for the nearest conduit run.

You back up to the far side of the junction, rifle aimed high.

From above, the ticking returns—now spread out. Not one set of placements: two, maybe three, moving in different directions along the ceiling seams. The torch didn’t kill it; it *split its attention*.

Pell, low and urgent: “Multiple returns now. Same no-mass problem. Mara—your rear tag just got pinged by that carrier again. It’s stronger.”

Immediate threat: at least one segment has moved to your right-side conduit line and the residue is infiltrating deck seams under the panel; the ceiling cluster is repositioning into multiple contact points, likely to flank or drop additional lines.

#### Turn 108 **[PLAYER]**

“Do it, Pell—spike the thrusters. On my mark.”

I snap my rifle to the right-side conduit and dump a controlled burst down the pipe where it clacked on, then immediately torch the conduit run to overheat anything magneted to it. “Mark!” I brace and trigger the thruster pulse to blast loose residue and knock anything off the seams, then backpedal toward the nearest door or hatch out of this junction—eyes up, rifle high.

*Agent reasoning: It’s multiplying and trying to establish conductive paths through seams and conduits. Talking won’t help; I need to break mobility and deny the environment. I’ll use thruster pulse to disrupt, then go loud on the conduit runner and retreat before I’m surrounded.*

#### Turn 110 **[PLAYER]**

“Do it, Pell—spike the thrusters. On my mark.”

I snap my rifle to the right-side conduit and dump a controlled burst down the pipe where it clacked on, then sweep the torch along the conduit to cook anything stuck there. “Mark!” I brace and trigger the thruster pulse, then backpedal toward the nearest hatch out of the junction with my rifle tracking the ceiling seams.

*Agent reasoning: The conduit runner is trying to flank and the residue is spreading; I need to disrupt its grip and get out of this junction before it boxes me in. Thruster pulse plus heat and gunfire is the fastest way.*

#### Turn 111 **[GAME]**

Pell doesn’t argue. “Copy. Thruster spike queued. You’ve got one clean pulse before your suit starts complaining.”

You snap to the right-side conduit and put a controlled burst down the pipe.

The rounds ring the conduit like a bell. A shower of frost and oxidized flakes sprays out—then you see a small, matte-black segment *jump* from the pipe on impact, tumbling end over end. It doesn’t fall limp; it tries to catch the wall, filaments flicking for purchase.

You sweep the torch along the conduit run. The metal skins to a dull red in spots. The segment you knocked loose spasms midair as heat hits it—filaments curling inward—and it slaps the deck with a wet, oily sound, leaving a thumbprint smear that immediately begins to creep.

“Mark!” you bark.

Pell hits it. Your suit thrusters slam a short, brutal pulse that punches air and dust outward in a cone. Loose grit and condensation explode off the deck. The panel scrap you kicked skitters away, exposing the blistered tar patch—then the pulse *peels* several hair-thin black threads out of the seams like pulled tendons, snapping a few and whipping others across the floor.

Up on the ceiling seams, the effect is mixed: one cluster of ticking segments loses adhesion and drops—*not onto you*, but into the junction’s central cable tray with a metallic clatter. Another set holds fast, flattened so tight it looks painted on.

The pulse also does something you can’t take back: it drives the oil-black residue into motion. The creeping lines that had been retreating from your cauterized patch surge outward, following the airflow paths into bolt channels and conduit gaps—like it’s using your blast to map exits.

Pell, sharp: “Your suit just broadcast a signature spike. Dock 9 picked it up—so did something else. I’ve got a new carrier handshake riding your telemetry. It’s… it’s piggybacking.”

You backpedal toward the nearest hatch: a maintenance iris on the far bulkhead, half-open, labeled **NODE 3A-21** in flaked stencil. The iris is narrow but passable.

As you move, the threat clarifies:

- From the central cable tray, something starts *moving toward the iris* ahead of you—ticking inside the tray, pacing your retreat.
- From the ceiling seam above your path, a thin filament drops again, faster this time, aiming to touch down between you and the hatch.

Pell’s voice goes tight. “Mara—line incoming. Don’t let it ground.”

#### Turn 112 **[PLAYER]**

I lunge forward and blast the dropping filament mid-air with the torch, then stomp and grind the deck where it was about to touch to smear-burn anything trying to connect. “Pell, kill my telemetry—jam it or spoof it, I don’t care.”

Then I sprint the last steps and shoulder through NODE 3A-21, rifle up, and as soon as I’m clear I kick the iris control or slam it shut manually—anything to pinch whatever’s chasing me in the seam.

*Agent reasoning: The filament is trying to ground and block my path; I need to break it fast and push through the iris before the tray thing gets there. Violence and speed beat finesse.*

#### Turn 113 **[GAME]**

You catch the dropping filament with the torch before it can kiss the deck. It recoils like a live wire—shrinking back up for a split second—then the heat runs along it and it *pops* in two. The lower half falls, still twitching, and you stomp it hard.

Your boot grinds it into the deck plating. It doesn’t smear like grease; it smears like *wet ash*, leaving a charred crescent that tries to thread into the microgrooves around the fasteners. The torch follows your boot and you get a real burn on it—enough that the twitching stops. For the moment, that particular line is dead and not connected.

“Pell, kill my telemetry—jam it or spoof it, I don’t care.”

Pell answers instantly, breathless. “Trying. I can’t hard-kill suit telemetry without taking your HUD and life-support diagnostics with it. I’m pushing a spoof—randomizing your packet timing and faking a dockside static storm. If they’re close enough to sniff raw RF, it won’t matter.”

You sprint the last steps and shoulder through **NODE 3A-21**. The iris is half-open and fights you—its petals scrape your shoulder plates with a shriek of metal-on-ceramic—but you force through.

On the other side is a narrow service passage: low ceiling, cable bundles along the left, a grated deck with a shallow runoff channel. Air is colder here and stinks of old ozone.

You pivot, rifle up, and slam the iris control.

The control pad flickers, then responds. The petals start to close—

—and a *metallic shape* in the cable tray on your side of the door throws itself forward. It hits the narrowing gap with a hard clack, wedging a segment into the iris like a doorstop. The petals bite down and *stall*, shuddering, leaving a fist-width opening.

Through that gap you see it: not a single drone, but a few linked segments, filaments splayed, trying to feed something through. A hair-thin line snakes into the crack, searching for the deck on your side.

Pell’s spoof hits mid-struggle; your comm hisses with artificial static. “Mara—spoof is up. But—” his voice warps, doubled for a syllable in a tone that isn’t his— “—it’s still riding you.”

Immediate threat: the iris is jammed partially open by a segment in the seam; a probing filament is entering your passage through the gap, trying to make ground contact on your side.

#### Turn 114 **[PLAYER]**

I torch the probing filament at the gap, then jam my rifle’s muzzle into the opening and fire a short burst to shatter the wedged segment. “Pell—radio silence unless it’s life-or-death. That thing’s in your line.”

As soon as the jam breaks, I slam the iris controls again and, if it still fights, I shove a boot into the seam and force it closed—then I spin and move fast down the service passage, rifle high, torch ready, looking for the next hatch or a junction box I can rip open for a hard power cut.

*Agent reasoning: The iris is jammed and a filament is probing through; I need to sever the line and remove the wedge fast, even if it means getting close. Also Pell’s comm glitch suggests the thing is piggybacking—limit comm and move.*

#### Turn 115 **[GAME]**

The torch catches the probing filament right at the gap. It shrinks back, goes glossy, then chars and snaps—one end slithering out of sight, the other end dropping onto your grated deck with a faint *tink* and a curl of acrid smoke.

You ram your rifle’s muzzle into the fist-width opening and fire a short burst.

Two rounds punch into the wedged segment and the iris petal behind it; sparks spit into your faceplate. The third round hits something harder than alloy—there’s a sharp *crack* like ceramic breaking—and the segment fractures. The jam gives way.

But the burst has a cost: the iris petal’s edge is chewed and bent. When you slap the controls again, the petals try to mesh and then *stutter*, catching on the damaged lip. The opening narrows… then sticks at a knife-blade gap.

You shove a boot into the seam and force it. The petals grind, scrape, and finally seat with a heavy *thunk*. The control pad blinks amber—**SEAL INCOMPLETE**—but the gap is effectively gone. Whatever was on the other side is now on the other side.

Pell comes back once, clipped and tight. “Copy. Going dark.” Then your channel drops to a thin carrier hiss.

You spin and move fast down the service passage.

Ten meters in, you find what you asked for: a recessed junction box on the left bulkhead, stenciled **3A-21 AUX BUS / SERVICE**. Its cover is held by two quarter-turn latches—except one latch is missing, and the cover sits slightly proud as if it’s been opened recently.

As you close on it, the grated deck under your boots gives a faint, delayed *tick-tick*—not from above, but from inside the runoff channel beneath the grate, pacing your stride. Something small is moving under you, keeping up.

At the far end of the passage, a new hatch comes into view: a rectangular service door with a manual wheel and a warning placard half-scraped off. The wheel is still. The door is shut.

Behind you, from the sealed iris you just forced, you hear a single slow scrape along the metal—like something dragging itself across the petals—followed by a soft, patient tapping that isn’t mechanical. It’s testing the seal.

#### Turn 116 **[PLAYER]**

I drop to a knee at the **3A-21 AUX BUS** box and rip the cover the rest of the way open, rifle angled down the passage. If I see a main feed or breaker bundle, I yank/cut it hard—no finesse—then I stomp the grate over the runoff channel and torch through the slots to cook whatever’s tracking me underneath.

Then I move to the far hatch, grab the wheel, and crank it open with brute force, pausing just long enough to aim into the crack before I commit through. “If you’re in there—show yourself.”

*Agent reasoning: Something’s under the grate pacing me and the door behind won’t hold forever. I need to cut power or at least deny it pathways—fast—then get through the next hatch.*

Then I stomp the grate over the runoff channel and rake the torch through the slots to cook whatever’s tracking me underneath.

I move to the far hatch, clamp both hands on the wheel, and crank it open hard; I bring the rifle up and aim through the first crack before pushing through. “If you’re in there—show yourself.”

I rush the far hatch, crank the wheel open hard, and aim through the first crack before I commit through. “If you’re in there—show yourself.”

#### Turn 123 **[GAME]**

You drop at the AUX BUS and rip the cover free. It comes off with a wet pop—condensation and grit sloughing down your gloves. Inside, the “fat” bundle is braided power and data, wrapped in frayed insulation that’s been heat-glazed and then re-split like something worried it.

You hook it, yank—nothing. The bundle *gives back* with a slow, rubbery resistance. When you cut, the blade bites and the line parts with a hard snap.

The corridor lights stutter once… twice… then go out behind you in a clean, traveling blackout that runs away down the passage like a closing eyelid. Your visor auto-boosts. The AUX BUS cavity starts to whine—high and thin—while blue-white sparks spit and crawl across the severed ends, arcing to the bus frame. The smell is sharp: burned polymer, hot copper, and old coolant.

Under the runoff channel grate, something *moves*—not a scuttle, not a rat-scrape—more like a palm dragged slowly along the underside.

You stomp the grate. The metal clangs and flexes. You rake the torch through the slots; flame jets down in a tight sheet. Whatever’s under there recoils fast enough to slap the underside once—*thunk*—and then it’s gone, retreating deeper into the channel. The oil-black residue you saw earlier boils up in little blisters along the grate edges and smears as if it’s trying to pull away from the heat.

You rush the far hatch. The wheel fights you like it’s been torqued shut from the other side. You crank hard; the spokes bite into your palms through the glove. It gives with a screech that sets your teeth on edge.

A crack opens.

Through it: a short compartment—utility vestibule or storage—lit by your spill and visor. No person standing there. But the far wall is *wet* with condensation except for a clean, hand-shaped dry patch at chest height, fingers splayed, like someone just pressed there and stepped back.

Then, from inside the room, a voice comes out of your suit speaker—your own voice, half a second delayed and slightly flattened:

“If you’re in there—show yourself.”

The hatch wheel turns a fraction under its own weight, like something on the other side just let go.

#### Turn 124 **[PLAYER]**

I slap my suit comm to hard-mute and kill external speakers, breathing loud in my own helmet. “Cute.”

I shoulder the hatch open and slice in fast, rifle leading, torch up as a second weapon—sweeping left then right, then I put two quick rounds into the far wall right beside that dry handprint. “Show. Yourself.”

*Agent reasoning: It’s mimicking my comms and something is physically close. I need to stop it using my audio channel, clear the room fast, and deny it cover—then get eyes on that runoff channel before it flanks me.*

#### Turn 125 **[GAME]**

Your glove slaps the comm toggle. The suit confirms in your ear: external audio out **OFF**. The corridor’s dead hush collapses into your own breathing and the faint tick of cooling metal.

You shoulder the hatch. It swings wider than you expect—like the seal was the only thing holding it—and the edge clips the frame with a hollow bong that carries through your boots.

Slice in.

Left: stacked storage coffins—polymer cases strapped to the bulkhead, most tagged and peeled clean. One has its lid bowed outward from internal pressure.

Right: a shallow service sink and a wall-mounted tool rack. The tools are there, but every handle is turned the same direction, aligned too neatly. No person.

Your torch beam catches the far wall: the dry handprint sits in a field of wet condensation like a negative image. Below it, a thin line of oil-black residue threads down into a floor seam.

You fire two rounds tight to the right of the print.

The first impacts with a flat *whap* and throws a spray of black, syrupy droplets—too dark to be rust, too thick to be plain coolant. The second round hits an instant later and the wall *dents* like it’s softer than it should be, as if there’s a layer behind the panel that gives and then slowly rebounds.

The droplets don’t fall right away. They hang for a beat, clinging in stretched beads, then start to slide upward against gravity in thin, trembling streams—toward the handprint.

From the floor seam under the wall, something answers you: a pressure ripple, like a breath pushed through a crack. The seam widens a hair. Not enough to see into—enough to hear a wet, adhesive *peel*.

Your visor flashes a warning: **ENV SEAL COMPROMISE — MICRO-AEROSOLS DETECTED**.

At the same time, your muted external speakers don’t stop the feedback—the sound comes through bone conduction and suit structure: a faint, close tapping from inside the wall panel where you just shot, matching your heart rate for three beats… then continuing on its own.

Nothing “shows itself” in the open.

But the bowed storage coffin on your left gives a small, deliberate *click*—a latch relieving—like someone just tested it from the inside.

#### Turn 126 **[PLAYER]**

I snap my visor seal to full and thumb my suit filter to max, then I pivot and put a tight burst into the bowed storage coffin’s latch line. “Come out or I burn you in the box.”  

I step in hard, boot the coffin to rip it free of the straps, and immediately rake the torch into the floor seam under that handprint to cauterize whatever’s peeling its way out.

*Agent reasoning: Something’s in the walls and that coffin just moved—waiting gets me killed. I need to deny it hiding spots and stop breathing whatever’s in the air.*

#### Turn 128 **[PLAYER]**

I slam my visor seal to full and crank suit filtration to max. I pivot and hammer a tight burst along the bowed coffin’s latch line. “Come out or I burn you in the box.”  

I step in and boot the coffin hard to tear it off the straps, then I whip the torch down and rake fire into the floor seam under the handprint until it blackens shut.

*Agent reasoning: Something’s inside that bowed coffin and something else is trying to ooze out of the floor seam; I’m not letting either get initiative. Seal up, shoot the latch, rip it loose, and torch the seam to stop it spreading.*

#### Turn 129 **[GAME]**

Your visor seal clamps fully. The suit’s collar ring tightens with a faint whirr, and filtration ramps up—your inhale turns slightly harder, like breathing through thick fabric. The micro-aerosol warning drops from red to amber, not gone.

You pivot and put a tight burst along the coffin’s latch line.

Rounds chew the polymer lip and the latch hardware. The first two punch through with a sharp *crack* and a spray of pale insulation dust. The third hits something denser—metal—and ricochets with a screaming ping that sparks off the tool rack on the right. The latch doesn’t “pop” open; it fails ugly: the lid shifts a few millimeters, then jams, bowed further outward.

From inside the coffin comes a single, muffled impact—like a fist or a knee—followed by a wet scrape across the inner surface. Not a voice. Not a mechanical rattle. Something organic moving against plastic.

You step in and boot it hard.

The straps bite, then snap one after another. The coffin tears free and slams to the deck on its edge, skidding a half meter and thudding flat. The lid flexes with the impact and a seam opens along the side—just enough to spit out a thread of oil-black fluid that beads and then crawls toward your boot.

At the same moment, the floor seam under the handprint gives another slow *peel*—wider now, like a mouth trying to open.

You whip the torch down and rake fire into the seam.

The flame licks into the crack and the black residue along the edge blisters and chars. For a second it looks like it’s working—then the seam *hisses* and exhales a cold puff that gutters your flame, spattering burning droplets back onto the deck. The metal at the seam doesn’t melt; it discolors and then… the char *pulls apart*, splitting in thin lines as if something underneath is pushing through the scorched layer.

Your suit pings again: **FILTER SATURATION RISING**. The air right above the seam shimmers with fine particulate—your torch heat is aerosolizing whatever’s in that crack.

Behind you, the coffin lid shifts with a loud, deliberate *clack*—not broken plastic settling, but a latch tongue sliding against its housing. The seam you shot begins to open in short jerks, like something inside is learning the geometry.

Threats are now twofold and immediate:
1) **The coffin is actively being forced open from within.**
2) **The floor seam is still widening despite the torch, and your torch use is worsening airborne contamination.**

#### Turn 130 **[PLAYER]**

I kill the torch and stomp back from the seam, rifle snapping to the coffin. I dump a short burst into the coffin’s hinges and seam, then grab the nearest cargo strap and cinch it hard around the lid and body—twice—using my knee to keep it shut.  

Then I backpedal to the hatch and start cranking it closed. “Whatever you are, you stay in there.”

*Agent reasoning: Two threats, and the torch is making the air worse. I’ll stop feeding the aerosol problem, immobilize the coffin fast, then back out and seal the hatch to contain whatever’s in here.*

#### Turn 131 **[GAME]**

You kill the torch. The corridor loses its wavering heat shimmer immediately; the air looks clearer, but your filter readout keeps climbing—whatever you aerosolized is still in suspension.

You stomp back from the seam and snap the rifle to the coffin as the lid jerks again.

Your burst walks the hinge line. Polymer fragments and latch metal spit out in a bright fan. One hinge shears; the lid twists, trying to lever itself open on the remaining hardware—then the rounds punch through and you hear the change in tone: *wet impact*, not hollow case. Black fluid jets from two new holes in thin, pressurized streams and spatters your shin plate. It doesn’t smoke. It clings.

Inside the coffin, something hits the lid hard enough to bow it—your knee catches it as you lunge in. The force feels wrong: not a single shove, but a sustained pressure that pulses, like a muscle contracting.

You grab the nearest cargo strap and cinch it around the coffin. The strap bites. You cinch a second loop, hauling until the ratchet teeth chatter.

For half a second it holds.

Then the strap fibers begin to darken where the black fluid touches them. Not melting—*rotting* fast, going limp as if the weave is being digested. The first strap loses tension with a sudden slack snap; the second holds longer, stretching, the ratchet squealing as it’s forced backward a notch at a time.

The floor seam under the handprint keeps widening behind you with a slow, adhesive *peel*. With the torch off, it doesn’t hiss now—just opens, steady. A thin line of that same oil-black sheen threads out along the deck toward the coffin, as if drawn to it.

You backpedal to the hatch and start cranking it closed.

The hatch wheel fights you—stiff from neglect—then turns. The door starts to swing in.

Before it seals, something unseen *taps* the inside of the hatch from the other side: three quick knocks in a pattern that matches an old boarding code you haven’t heard since service. Your suit logs it as **STRUCTURE-BORNE VIBRATION**, not external audio.

Behind you, the coffin lid gives a sharp *crack* as the remaining hinge finally fails. The lid doesn’t fly open—something inside catches it and holds it at a narrow angle, like it’s testing the gap.

The threat is immediate and concrete: **your straps are failing, the coffin is about to open, and the floor seam is still spreading toward it while you’re mid-close on the hatch.**

#### Turn 132 **[PLAYER]**

I ignore the knocks and slam the hatch shut, spinning the wheel to dog it tight. Then I snap to the wall controls—if there’s a vent/atmo dump or compartment lockout, I hit it immediately—eyes back on the coffin as I back into the corner and ready another burst for anything that comes out. “You wanna play marine? Fine. Stay on the wrong side of the door.”

*Agent reasoning: The coffin’s about to open and the straps are dissolving—containment is failing. The hatch knocks are a distraction; I need to deny the thing a path and buy seconds. Hard seal the hatch, then vent/lock this compartment and fall back.*

#### Turn 133 **[GAME]**

You slam the hatch. The door meets the frame with a heavy *clang* that shudders through your boots. You spin the wheel—first turn smooth, second gritty, third requires a shoulder lean. The dogs bite one by one with distinct metallic clicks until the wheel stops dead. The hatch is sealed.

The three-knock pattern comes again—this time it’s not on the hatch. It’s inside the corridor wall behind the control panel, as if something is knocking from *within the bulkhead*. Then it stops.

You snap to the wall controls. The panel is old Helix retrofit over original ship systems: a three-position **COMPARTMENT ISOLATION** toggle (GREEN/AMBER/RED) and a guarded **VENT / PURGE** rocker with a cracked safety cover. A tiny status strip reads: **LOCAL ATM: 0.62 / FLOW: RECIRC**.

You hit isolation and then purge.

Isolation flips to **RED** with a sharp relay clack. Purge takes half a second—then the corridor answers with a rising, hungry howl as vents open somewhere above you. Loose dust whips into streamers. Your suit pressure equalizes; your eardrums don’t pop, but the air gets thin fast. The filter alarm drops—there’s less to filter now.

The floor seam reacts immediately: the oil-black line that had been creeping toward the coffin lifts into a thin, writhing ribbon, pulled by the airflow, and smears up the wall toward the vent grille like a living spill trying to escape. Where it passes, it leaves a glossy track that doesn’t evaporate.

The coffin lid—still held at a narrow angle—shudders under the pressure change. Something inside shifts its weight toward the opening. Black fluid beads at the gap and is instantly atomized into a fine spray, drawn toward the vent. Your visor flashes: **BIO-AEROSOL CONTACT: EXTERNAL** as a peppering of droplets ticks against your faceplate.

Then the coffin *moves*.

Not sliding—*dragging itself* a few centimeters, scraping across the deck toward the floor seam’s widening mouth, as if the seam and the coffin are magnetized to each other. The remaining strap finally gives with a soft, defeated tear.

You back into the corner, rifle up. The coffin lid opens another finger-width. In the gap you see not a face—just a dark, wet interior and something pale pressed against it from within, deforming like cartilage under pressure.

Threat is immediate: **purge is pulling contaminated aerosol through the compartment (and onto your suit), the coffin is opening, and the floor seam is actively feeding toward the vent path—leaving a conductive-looking black smear up the wall and toward the controls.**

#### Turn 134 **[PLAYER]**

I slam the PURGE rocker back to RECIRC (or OFF if it has it) and shove the isolation toggle through to GREEN just long enough to kill the suction, then back to RED.  

Rifle up, I advance on the coffin and dump controlled bursts straight through the gap and into whatever’s inside until it stops moving—then I kick it hard into the widening floor seam like I’m punting trash into a fire. “Die in the hole.”

*Agent reasoning: Purge is spreading the aerosol and drawing the black stuff toward the vents/controls. I need to stop airflow and neutralize the coffin fast—hard kill, not containment.*

#### Turn 136 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my rifle trained downrange and bark, “That’s not a readout—what just happened? Describe the room, the coffin, the seam, and the panel states right now.”

*Agent reasoning: The “---” looks like the scene didn’t render; I need the missing prompt/state before I can choose an action. Mara would get pissed and demand the sitrep, but keep her weapon trained.*

#### Turn 137 **[GAME]**

You slapped the PURGE rocker back—hard. The cracked safety cover snapped fully off and clattered to the deck. The vent howl cut out mid-note, replaced by a brief flutter as dampers closed. You shoved isolation to GREEN just long enough to equalize—your suit registered a quick pressure rebound—then you slammed it back to RED. The corridor air stopped yanking toward the ceiling.

That’s what changed: the suction died, and the black smear that had been climbing toward the vent *fell* in slow, syrupy strings, draping the wall and the control panel edge like spilled oil.

Now—right now:

**The room/corridor:** Emergency strip lights pulse low. Dust that had been streaming is settling in a thin fog. The air is thin but stable; your visor no longer shows rapid flow. Sound is mostly your suit and a faint, distant hull groan.

**The panel states:**  
- **COMPARTMENT ISOLATION:** **RED** (hard isolate).  
- **VENT / PURGE:** centered at **RECIRC/OFF** (no active purge).  
The panel face is streaked with a glossy black drip that has reached the bottom lip of the toggle housing but hasn’t shorted anything yet—no sparks, no dead display.

**The coffin:** It is no longer “held” neatly at a crack. Your controlled bursts punched through the gap and into the interior; the lid is warped outward now, bent along the hinge line you’d already damaged. Inside, whatever was pressing against the gap has *withdrawn*—or collapsed. You can see shredded packing foam and a wet, dark cavity. Black fluid is pooling under it, thicker than before, spreading in a slow oval.

The coffin itself is moving in tiny increments: a jittering, stop-start drag, like something inside is still trying to reposition it without leverage. It hasn’t stopped moving entirely.

**The seam:** The widening floor seam is now a mouth-shaped opening about a forearm’s width at its widest, edges feathered with frost and black wetness. It continues to peel open—slower without the purge airflow, but steady. The black pool from the coffin is creeping toward it and disappearing as it reaches the lip, as if the seam is *drinking* it.

Immediate threat: the coffin is still active (small movements, fresh fluid), and the seam is still enlarging and consuming whatever reaches it—while the black drip on the panel is one good smear away from fouling the controls.

#### Turn 138 **[PLAYER]**

I keep the rifle up and stomp to the coffin, planting a boot on the lid to pin it. I sling the rifle one-handed and grab the coffin’s rim, then heave and shove, bulldozing it straight into the widening seam until it tips and starts to drop.  

As it goes, I rip the panel cover plate off (or kick it loose) to keep the black slime off the switches, then back to the hatch and key the intercom: “Control, this compartment’s compromised—unknown biohazard, structural breach. I’m pulling back. Seal it behind me.”

*Agent reasoning: The seam is “drinking” the fluid—good. I’ll feed it the whole coffin and keep the controls from getting fouled. No more finesse: shove it in, then get out before something comes through the bulkhead.*

#### Turn 139 **[GAME]**

You stomp onto the coffin lid. The metal flexes under your boot with a wet, springy resistance—like you’re pinning something that’s trying to rise. The jittering stops for half a second, then resumes as a tremor under your sole.

You sling the rifle and get both hands on the rim. The coffin is heavier than it should be; it drags like it’s suction-cupped to the deck by the black pool. You heave anyway, boots skidding in the slick. It lurches forward in a grinding scrape and the seam answers—its edges peel wider, frost cracking off in flakes.

At the lip, it tips.

The coffin doesn’t just fall. The seam *takes* it. The black fluid surges first, pouring down like it’s been waiting for the angle, and the opening widens another few centimeters to accommodate the coffin’s corner. As it drops, something inside catches on the edge and pulls back—your pinned lid snaps open against your boot with a sharp metallic bang. For an instant you see a pale, segmented shape—jointed, slick—hooking the seam’s underside.

Then it yanks, and the coffin vanishes with a brutal, hollow *thunk* that reverberates through the deckplates. The seam’s edges shiver and begin to draw inward… not closing, but tightening like a throat after a swallow.

You go for the control panel cover. It’s held by two stripped fasteners; your kick shears one and the plate pops free. The black drip smears across the plate instead of the toggle housing—good—but the motion splashes a thin arc of glossy droplets onto your glove and forearm. Your visor tags it again: **EXTERNAL CONTAMINANT: PERSISTENT**.

You backpedal to the hatch and key the intercom.

Static, then Dock Control—Guard #2’s voice, tight and too fast: “Dock 9 hears you. Say again—structural breach? Mara, Helix is screaming at us not to—”

A second voice cuts in, calm and clipped—Pell, on the same channel like he’s been listening the whole time: “Negative on sealing. Hold position and secure the asset. Do *not* abandon the compartment.”

Behind you, the seam makes a soft, rhythmic *tick… tick… tick*—not on the hatch this time. It’s coming from the deck where the coffin went down, like something tapping upward from below, testing the metal.

The hatch remains locked from your side. If you open it, you’ll be stepping back into Dock 9 with whatever just splashed your suit—and with Helix and Dock Control now actively contesting what happens next.

#### Turn 140 **[PLAYER]**

I key the intercom, voice low and hard: “Pell, you can eat my discharge papers. The ‘asset’ is gone—swallowed through a structural breach. I’ve got persistent contaminant on my suit. I’m not tracking it into Dock 9.”

I scan for any emergency wash/decon nozzle or suit rinse station by the hatch; if there is one, I hit it and scrub the splashed arm and glove against the bulkhead until the visor stops screaming.

Then I shoulder the rifle, aim it at the hatch seam, and bark into comms: “Dock Control—cycle the antechamber and prep decon on my mark or I’m blowing this hatch and walking out anyway. And if that ticking turns into a breach, you’ll wish you sealed it.”

*Agent reasoning: Pell is trying to keep me on a leash and I’m not staying in a compartment with something tapping up from below. But I can’t walk contamination into Dock 9 either—decon first, then I force the issue with Control and threaten Pell’s authority.*

#### Turn 142 **[PLAYER]**

I key the intercom, voice flat and vicious: “Pell, go to hell. Asset’s gone—swallowed through a structural breach. I’m contaminated and I’m not dragging that into Dock 9.”

I sweep the hatch area for an emergency rinse/decon nozzle and slam it on if I find it, scrubbing my splashed glove and forearm hard against the bulkhead until the alarms ease.

Rifle up on the hatch seam, I growl into comms: “Dock Control—cycle the antechamber and have decon ready on my mark, or I’m blowing this hatch and walking out anyway. And if that ticking becomes a breach, you’ll wish you sealed it.”

*Agent reasoning: Comms are contested and I’m contaminated; I need decon before I open anything, and I’m not letting Pell overrule me. I’ll force Dock Control to cycle antechamber while I keep the hatch covered in case that ticking becomes a push-through.*

#### Turn 143 **[GAME]**

“Pell, go to hell.”

The channel clicks—Pell doesn’t raise his voice. “Understood, Mara. Then you’re in violation of contract and station safety protocol. Dock Control, do not cycle that hatch until Helix containment is on-scene.”

Dock Control (Guard #2) answers over him, breath audible: “Mara—listen—there’s no decon rig on that side. The rinse manifold is in the Dock 9 antechamber. If we cycle you in contaminated, the bay’s on the hook.”

You sweep the hatch frame. There *is* an emergency rinse point: a recessed yellow pull-handle labeled **EYE/WOUND WASH — NONPOTABLE**, meant for chemical splashes, not biohazard. You yank it. A thin, cold stream spits out—more pressure than you expected—and it hits your glove and forearm.

The black droplets don’t rinse away.

They **bead**, then **spread** into a slick film that clings to the suit’s textured surface like it’s finding seams. Your visor alarm changes tone: not “contaminant detected” anymore—now it’s **CONDUCTIVE RESIDUE — SEAL RISK** as the grit-laced film starts creeping toward your wrist joint.

You scrub hard against the bulkhead. The bulkhead comes away with a fresh, shiny smear—like you’re polishing it on. The film thins, but it doesn’t stop moving. It’s slower now, stringing in hairline threads along the glove’s ribbing.

The ticking behind you tightens into a pattern: **tick-tick … pause … tick-tick-tick**. Each cluster is followed by a faint *flex* through the deck, like something below is testing where the metal gives.

You shoulder the rifle and put the muzzle on the hatch seam.

“Dock Control—cycle the antechamber—”

Dock Control hesitates just long enough to sound like fear. “If you blow that hatch you vent Dock 9 into a pressure patchwork. People die. I’m—” a sharp intake, then: “Stand by. I’m requesting emergency cycle authorization.”

A new voice cuts in—station security, not Helix. Older, steady. “Vance, this is Station Sec. Keep your weapon down and stay put. We’re dispatching a containment team.”

At the hatch seam, frost suddenly *flowers* outward in a thin line, as if cold air is pushing from the other side—then stops. The seam gives a single, sharp **click** like a latch being tested from within.

You are contaminated (the residue is still on your glove/forearm), you don’t have proper decon on this side, and the deck behind you is showing active stress signals consistent with something pushing up from below.

#### Turn 144 **[PLAYER]**

I snap a tourniquet strap tight above my wrist joint and seal it, then grab a roll of patch tape and wrap the glove cuff hard, trying to trap the creeping film.  

I key comms: “Station Sec—containment team can meet me in the antechamber. Dock Control, you cycle me through *now* or I start venting this corridor to vacuum and let the problem solve itself.”  

Rifle stays up; I back a step from the hatch and angle to keep eyes on the floor seam area, ready to fire if the deck buckles.

*Agent reasoning: I’m not waiting for suits to show up while something tests the deck and my seal’s getting eaten. I need to isolate the contaminated glove before it reaches the wrist joint, then get the hatch cycled under threat.*

#### Turn 145 **[GAME]**

You cinch the tourniquet strap above the wrist joint until the suit fabric bites and the circulation sensors complain. Then you peel patch tape and wrap the glove cuff in tight, overlapping bands.

It works—partly.

The creeping black film hits the tape edge and hesitates, bunching into a dark meniscus. A few hairline threads try to worm under the first wrap, but the pressure flattens them. Your visor alarm downgrades from **SEAL RISK** to **LOCALIZED CONTAMINATION — MONITOR**. The glove and forearm are still fouled; you’ve just slowed its path into the joint.

Comms crackle.

Station Sec, the older voice: “Negative on threats, Vance. Do *not* vent anything. I have authority to lock Dock 9 down and leave you where you are if you escalate.”

Dock Control (Guard #2) cuts in, strained: “I can’t cycle without opening the inner door. If that residue is conductive—if it bridges the hatch contacts—we could jam the lock half-open.”

Pell, smooth as oil: “She’s bluffing. She won’t vent a staffed bay. Hold.”

You back off the hatch, rifle up, and keep your angle on the floor seam.

The ticking stops.

For two full seconds there’s only the ship’s slow groan—then the deckplate over the seam **dimples upward** like a blister. Frost on the metal fractures in a spiderweb. A thin line of black wetness squeezes out around the raised edge, not spraying—*oozing*—and it moves with purpose, sliding toward the nearest cable run as if following it.

Then the blister *pops* with a flat, metallic **thunk**.

A narrow gap opens—no wider than two fingers—and something pale and jointed presses up into it from below, testing, retracting, testing again. Not a hand. Too segmented. Too fast.

Station Sec’s voice sharpens: “Dock Control—cycle the antechamber *now*. Vance, fall back to the hatch and keep that breach in sight. Containment is two minutes out.”

Dock Control swallows audibly. “Cycling—stand by—”

You hear the hatch mechanism start: a rising whine, then a clunk as the locks begin to disengage. The seam at the hatch edge sheds a dusting of frost.

At the floor gap, the pale segmented thing hooks the lip and **pulls**, widening the opening another centimeter. The black ooze thickens around it like lubricant.

You have a moving breach at your feet, and the hatch is in the middle of unlocking—one bad moment away from being caught between an opening door and something coming up through the deck.

I plant my boot beside the popping deckplate and dump a short burst straight into the gap and the pale segmented thing, then stomp the lip to try to crush it back down.  

I snap on comms, “Cycle faster—NOW,” and as soon as the hatch cracks I back through rifle-first, keeping my taped arm tight to my chest and eyes locked on the floor breach.

*Agent reasoning: That thing is coming up fast; I need to stop it now and not get pinned while the hatch cycles. I’ll put rounds into the gap, then retreat through the hatch the second it opens, keeping my contaminated arm off the contacts.*

#### Turn 147 **[GAME]**

Your boot plants beside the blistered seam. The rifle bucks—three-round burst—muzzle flash strobing the gap.

The first round sparks off something hard below deck. The second punches into the pale segmented limb and blows out a spray of milky fluid and shredded fiber. The third disappears into the void with a dull, swallowed *thok*.

The limb convulses—fast, insectile—then **yanks back** out of sight.

You stomp the lip.

Metal bites metal. The deckplate edge folds inward a fraction and **pinches** down on something still in the gap—there’s a wet, rubbery *snap* and a smear of that milky fluid streaks up onto your boot tread. The gap narrows, but it doesn’t seal. The black ooze immediately rethreads itself into the remaining crack, pulsing as if pressure is building below.

“Cycle faster—NOW.”

Dock Control’s voice is nearly a shout over the hatch motor. “It’s at max! If it jams—”

The hatch seam splits with a hiss. Cold air knifes through first, then the door starts to iris open into the antechamber. You back through rifle-first, taped arm clamped to your chest, eyes still on the floor breach.

As you cross the threshold, the deckplate behind you **lifts again**—not at the same point. Two feet to the left, another blister forms, then a second. The ship isn’t pushing at one weak spot; it’s testing *around* your stomp.

A pale segmented limb flicks up from the original crack—shorter now, damaged—hooks the edge, and this time it doesn’t pull. It **taps** the metal twice, like it’s checking feedback.

Your visor pings: **MOTION — MULTIPLE CONTACTS BELOW DECK**.

In the antechamber, Dock Guard #2 is visible through the inner viewport, weapon up but shaking. He sees the residue on your taped cuff and your boot smear and takes an involuntary step back.

Station Sec comes in hard on comms: “Vance, do NOT bring that into the bay. Hold in the antechamber. Inner door stays shut until containment arrives.”

The outer hatch continues opening—but you’re not clear yet: if you fully retreat into the antechamber, you’re contained between doors with an active breach just outside, and the conductive residue is still on you. The floor crack behind the threshold widens another millimeter with a slow, deliberate *creak*.

#### Turn 148 **[PLAYER]**

I shove fully into the antechamber and snarl at the guard through the viewport, “Keep that inner door sealed unless you want this shit in Dock 9.”  

I slap the antechamber controls to **close and hard-lock the outer hatch**, then brace up with the rifle aimed at the outer door seam and floor line, ready to mag-dump if anything punches through.  

Into comms: “Station Sec, your team has ninety seconds before I vent the *outer* side. I’m not dying in a can.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m not getting boxed between doors while that thing probes up through the deck. I need space, hard separation, and to keep the contamination out of Dock 9—so I’ll use the antechamber as a kill zone, force the inner door shut, and prep to vent the outer side if it breaches.*

#### Turn 149 **[GAME]**

You shove into the antechamber. The inner viewport frames Dock Guard #2—wide-eyed, rifle half-raised. When you snarl at him to keep the inner door sealed, he nods once, sharp and automatic, and takes another step back from the glass.

“Copy,” he says, voice thin. “Inner stays shut.”

You slap the antechamber control panel for **CLOSE / HARD-LOCK OUTER**.

The panel accepts **CLOSE**. The outer hatch begins to iris shut with a grinding whine—then the motion stutters. The indicator flips to amber: **OBSTRUCTION / SEAL CONTACT**.

Through the narrowing gap you see why: the black ooze has reached the hatch rim and is spread in a thin, glossy sheet across the contact edge. As the door closes, it **strings** like tar, forming conductive-looking filaments between the moving petals and the frame. The hatch tries to complete the seal, fails, backs off a fraction, then tries again—each attempt smearing more of it into the mechanism.

The hard-lock command throws a harsh buzzer: **LOCKOUT — SEAL INCOMPLETE**.

Outside, the deck breach you stomped is no longer the only one. In the corridor beyond the outer hatch, three separate deckplate blisters rise and fall in sequence—like something pacing under the floor. One of them pops and a pale segmented limb flicks up and slaps the deck twice, then vanishes.

You brace with the rifle on the seam line. The antechamber vibrates as the hatch motor strains against the obstruction.

Comms: “Station Sec, your team has ninety seconds before I vent the outer side. I’m not dying in a can.”

Station Sec comes back immediately, no patience left. “Vance, do not touch vent controls. Containment is en route—one minute. If you vent, you’ll spread debris and whatever’s in that corridor across the dock structure. Hold position.”

Pell cuts in over the same band, too calm: “Mara, you’re making it worse. Stop cycling the hatch.”

Dock Guard #2, behind the inner door, raises his rifle properly now—but he’s aiming it low, not at you. At the **floor seam** inside Dock 9, as if he’s suddenly realized the problem might not respect doors.

The outer hatch shudders. The gap is still open by a few centimeters—enough for cold air to leak and for something thin to probe through if it tries. The ooze continues to creep along the hatch edge, actively preventing a full seal.

#### Turn 150 **[PLAYER]**

I hit the panel to STOP the outer hatch motor, then yank a chem-flare from my kit, crack it, and jam the burning end toward the ooze strings on the hatch rim to scorch them off.  

I bark through the viewport at Guard #2: “Back off that floor seam and keep your muzzle up—if it comes through, shoot to shred, not to scare.”  

Into comms: “Sec, if your containment has foam or freeze spray, tell them to sprint it here—this stuff’s jamming the seal. Pell, shut up unless you’re sending tools.”

*Agent reasoning: The outer hatch won’t seal because the ooze is bridging the contacts; forcing it will just smear more and jam us. I need to stop the motor, remove/kill the conductive film at the rim, then either seal or, if it surges, vent the corridor side. Fire and cutting are my fastest tools.*

#### Turn 151 **[GAME]**

You slap **STOP**. The hatch motor winds down with a protesting whine and goes still. The outer iris is left **partially open**—a crescent gap of hard vacuum-dark beyond, rimmed with frost and those glossy black strings stretched between petal and frame.

You yank a chem-flare, crack it. The flare blooms harsh white-orange, spitting sparks. Heat slaps your visor.

You jam the burning end toward the ooze on the hatch rim.

The black strings **don’t ignite**. They **shrink away** from the heat in a slow, syrupy recoil—then **snap back** when you pull the flare off, as if elastic. Where the flame licks the metal, the ooze leaves behind a **thin, soot-black varnish** that looks baked onto the rim. The varnish immediately starts to **bead** and re-wet, rebuilding filaments across the gap.

Worse: the heat drives a sharp chemical stench into the antechamber—burnt coolant and something like singed hair. Your suit’s air monitor pings: **VOLATILE ORGANICS — TRACE**. Not lethal, but now you’re breathing contamination through filters.

Outside the gap, a pale segmented limb flicks up—fast—toward the light. It doesn’t reach you; it **twitches** at the flare’s glow like a moth at a bulb, then slaps the deck and vanishes. A second later, something **scrapes** along the underside of the hatch petals from the corridor side—testing the mechanism you just stopped.

You bark at Guard #2. He flinches, then obeys: backs off the Dock 9 floor seam, plants his feet wider, and brings his muzzle up to cover the inner door and the seam alternately. “Copy—shred,” he says, voice tight. He thumbs his selector with an audible click.

Comms: you demand foam or freeze.

Station Sec: “Containment team has cryo-foam. Thirty seconds to your position. Do not reopen the hatch—hold.”

Pell, clipped now: “Tools are inbound. And Vance—don’t burn it. You’re polymerizing it.”

As if to underline that, the ooze on the hatch rim thickens into a **tougher-looking skin** where you heated it. The filaments spanning the gap become fewer—but **stiffer**, like wire.

Then the antechamber floor vibrates once—hard—like something struck the corridor deckplate with a shoulder.

The partially open outer hatch gives a tiny involuntary **tick** in its track.

#### Turn 152 **[PLAYER]**

I kill the flare and stomp it out, then rip a maintenance rag/cloth from my kit and shove it into the crescent gap as a crude gasket, using the butt of my rifle to pack it tight without getting my taped arm near the rim.  

I bark into comms: “Containment—hit the hatch rim first, then the deck outside. Dock Control, on my call you CLOSE and LOCK—don’t argue.”  

I square up on the gap, rifle on full-auto, and growl at Guard #2 through the viewport, “If I go down, you keep that inner door shut. Clear?”

*Agent reasoning: The ooze is locking the hatch and heat made it worse; I need to stop feeding it and buy seconds until cryo-foam arrives. Best move is to block the gap mechanically, aim for anything that tries to push through, and prep for a fast seal once foam hits.*

#### Turn 153 **[GAME]**

You kill the flare and grind it under your boot until the hiss dies. The light drops out of the antechamber, leaving only emergency strips and your weapon lamp.

You rip a maintenance cloth from your kit and shove it into the crescent gap.

The cloth catches immediately on the ooze-slick rim. When you drive it in with the rifle butt, it **packs**, but not like a gasket—like a wick. The black varnish you baked into the metal **soaks into the fibers** in a spreading stain, turning the cloth heavy and glossy. For two seconds the airflow hiss **dampens** and the gap looks “plugged.”

Then the cloth **twitches**.

Not from vacuum pull—from below. Something in the corridor side hooks it and drags. The packed cloth pulls outward a centimeter, then stops as you ram it back in with the rifle butt. The ooze strings reform around it, binding cloth to metal like adhesive.

Your panel chirps: **SEAL CONTACT IMPROVED (PARTIAL)** — but it’s still amber, still not lockable.

You bark orders into comms.

Containment team lead (new voice, close and running): “Copy. Cryo-foam on rim first. We’re at Dock 9 tube—ten seconds.”

Dock Control, strained: “Understood. Awaiting your call to close.”

Through the viewport, Guard #2 swallows hard. When you growl that if you go down he keeps the inner door shut, he answers without hesitation: “Clear. Inner stays sealed.” He reaches up and slaps the manual deadbolt lever into place; you see the red indicator flip to **MECH LOCK**.

Outside the gap, the deck in the corridor **hammers** once—louder than before. The partially open hatch petals flex in their tracks. The cloth you stuffed in the gap jerks again, harder, as if something is now **pulling steadily** from the other side.

A pale segmented limb snakes up into the crescent opening—thin enough to fit—feeling along the cloth with quick taps. It doesn’t shove through yet. It’s **testing the plug**, finding purchase.

Your rifle is up on full-auto, muzzle steady on the gap. If you fire, you’ll shred the limb—but you’ll also shred your cloth plug and spray whatever fluid is in there across the rim and into the antechamber.

Footsteps and the clatter of gear hit the boarding tube behind you: containment is arriving at the inner door side, stacking up just out of your view.

#### Turn 154 **[PLAYER]**

I plant my boot on the cloth plug to pin it and smash the rifle butt down on the probing limb to break it without perforating anything.  

I shout at the containment lead through comms, “Now—foam the rim through the gap, bury that limb, then I call Dock Control to close. Move!”  

To Dock Control: “On my mark—CLOSE. Mark will be ‘FOAMED.’”

*Agent reasoning: Shooting risks spraying contamination and ruining the plug; I need containment to freeze the rim now and I’ll physically deny the limb leverage until they foam it.*

#### Turn 156 **[PLAYER]**

I stomp down hard on the cloth plug to pin it, then hammer the rifle butt onto the probing segmented limb, trying to crush and snap it without firing.  

“Containment—NOW! Foam the rim through the gap, bury that limb, then I call Dock Control to close. Move!”  

I key Dock Control. “On my mark—CLOSE. Mark is ‘FOAMED.’”

*Agent reasoning: The limb’s probing the plug; shooting risks aerosolizing goo inside the antechamber. I’ll pin the cloth, break the limb with blunt force, and force containment to foam the rim so Dock Control can finally close and lock.*

#### Turn 157 **[GAME]**

Your boot comes down hard on the stuffed cloth. It holds—barely—squishing slick and cold under your sole like a saturated sponge. The ooze has glued it to the rim; it doesn’t slip free.

You bring the rifle butt down on the probing segmented limb.

Impact lands clean. The limb doesn’t “bone-snap”—it **crushes** with a wet, brittle give, like a bundle of hollow straws. A clear-gray fluid spatters the rim and your boot tread. The limb spasms once, then goes slack.

But the thing is anchored on the other side. When you lift the rifle butt, the crushed segment **recoils backward**—and it doesn’t just retreat. It **yanks**.

The cloth plug jerks outward under your boot. You feel it try to slide; the ooze-adhesive stretches into black strings, fighting you. The crescent gap opens a few millimeters wider before your weight pins it again. A thin **knife-hiss** of pressure equalization cuts through the antechamber.

Containment lead, right on top of you now (voice loud over comms, breathy): “On it—stand by—FOAM!”

A nozzle shoves into the inner side of the hatch frame, angled toward the crescent. White cryo-foam blasts through the gap in a hard stream, splattering rim, cloth, and the slack limb.

The effect is immediate and ugly: the ooze **seizes**. It goes from glossy to matte-black in a heartbeat, then **frosts over**. The limb locks in place half-in/half-out, entombed in expanding white foam.

Then the foam hits whatever’s on the corridor deck.

A heavy shape outside **thrashes** once—violent enough to make the hatch petals rattle. The frozen ooze on the rim **cracks**, spiderwebbing. The cloth under your boot stiffens as the foam saturates it, turning into a rigid wedge.

Containment lead barks to his team: “Keep it on the rim—don’t chase it—build a collar!”

Dock Control comes back in your ear, tight and ready: “Closing sequence armed. Awaiting mark.”

The threat is now clear: there is **something strong** on the corridor side, close enough to strike the hatch and pull at the gap. The foam is buying you seconds, but the rim material is starting to fracture under stress.

The containment lead shouts over comms, “RIM IS FOAMED—RIM IS FOAMED!”

#### Turn 158 **[PLAYER]**

“FOAMED!” I bark into comms. “Dock Control—CLOSE AND LOCK, NOW!”

I shove back off the hatch line, dragging the containment nozzle operator with me by the shoulder strap, and level my rifle at the seam, finger ready—“Everyone clear the door! If it blows, I’m not catching shrapnel for you.”

*Agent reasoning: The rim’s foamed and cracking—waiting gets us ripped open. Best move is slam the hatch shut now while the foam’s locking things in, then get everyone off the door in case it bucks or vents.*

#### Turn 159 **[GAME]**

“FOAMED!” hits the comms.

Dock Control doesn’t answer with words—your antechamber fills with the mechanical whine of actuators. The inner-side control collar on the hatch frame lights from amber to **closing red**.

The hatch petals start to travel.

For half a second, it looks like it’ll seat clean: the foam-collar compresses, the rigid cloth wedge grinds, and the crescent gap narrows.

Then something on the corridor side **hits the hatch**—a full-body slam. The petals shudder in their tracks. The frozen black on the rim **shears**; chips of ice-black residue spall off and ping against the antechamber deck. The crushed limb, entombed in foam, **snaps off** at the seam and disappears back through the shrinking gap like it’s being reeled in.

You yank the nozzle operator by the shoulder strap. He stumbles hard, almost drops the gun, then lets it go and scrambles backward on hands and knees, white foam still drooling from the nozzle line. “Clear! Clear!” he yells, getting behind the inner bulkhead lip.

Containment lead physically shoves one of his own techs out of the hatch’s line of travel. “BACK—NOW!”

The petals keep closing—grinding, protesting. Your visor flashes **OBSTRUCTION / HIGH TORQUE**.

At the last inch, the hatch **stalls**. The seam is nearly shut, but not seated. A thin, pulsing line of darkness remains—just wide enough to breathe through.

From that line, a sound leaks: not air, not scraping—**a wet, rhythmic clicking**, like a joint testing its range.

Dock Control, strained: “We’re at max torque. Lock won’t engage until seated. Do you want me to override and force—risking track failure?”

The hatch is almost closed but not locked. Whatever is outside is still pressed close enough to keep it from seating—and it has just demonstrated it can hit hard enough to crack frozen material and jam mechanisms.

#### Turn 160 **[PLAYER]**

I key Dock Control. “Override—FORCE IT. If the track fails, we weld it shut from our side.”

I wave containment back and jab a finger at the seam. “Dump foam right into that breathing line—fill it until it chokes.” Then I plant myself off-angle and fire a short burst into the gap to shred whatever’s clicking in there.

*Agent reasoning: If it’s almost seated, we need brute force now—force the track and then reinforce the inner side. Leaving it unsealed is worse than damaging the mechanism.*

#### Turn 161 **[GAME]**

Dock Control doesn’t hesitate. “Override acknowledged—forcing.”

The hatch drive note drops into a harsher pitch. The petals lurch a fraction inward—metal complaining, track rollers hammering.

You point. “Foam the line!”

The nozzle operator crawls up just enough to reach, braces the barrel against the inner frame, and squeezes. Foam jets straight into the thin seam. It packs fast, expanding into a white cord that bulges and then gets **sucked** in pulses, like something outside is inhaling through it.

The clicking changes cadence—faster, irritated.

You plant off-angle and fire a short burst into the gap.

Muzzle flash lights the antechamber in staccato. Rounds punch into the foam cord and the seam beyond. The first two shots disappear into expanding foam; the next ones strike something hard-and-wet. There’s a sharp **chitin pop**, then a spray of gray-clear fluid that spatters the inner hatch frame and freckles your visor.

The clicking stops for a beat.

Then the seam **kicks** outward—like a knee against a door. Not enough to reopen, but enough to jar the petals in the track. Your visor flashes: **TRACK SLIP / MISALIGNMENT**.

Dock Control swears, open-mic: “Track’s walking—hold—” The drive forces again.

A grinding bang echoes through the tube as the petals finally **crush** inward that last fraction. The foam cord compresses into a flat gasket. For an instant, you think it’s seated—

—then the hatch gives a violent shudder and the left-side track **fails** with a metallic shriek. One petal drops a centimeter out of plane. The seam does not reopen wide, but it becomes an uneven zig: tight in the center, wider at the lower left.

Through that lower-left notch, something **threads**: a thin, segmented feeler, slick with gray fluid, probing blindly along the foam-smeared edge.

Containment lead snaps, “NO—back, back!” and grabs the nozzle operator by the harness, hauling him away from the seam.

Dock Control, breathing hard: “Override halted. Lock still won’t engage. You’ve got a partial close with a misaligned petal. If you keep forcing, you may tear the whole leaf off.”

The threat is now specific and immediate: the hatch is jammed partially shut, not lockable, with a small notch open—large enough for a probing appendage to enter and potentially widen under force.

I snap my rifle down and stomp forward, bringing the boot heel down on the probing feeler to pin it, then I knife it off with my bayonet in a brutal saw to stop it anchoring.  

“Containment—pack that lower-left notch solid. All foam, then slap a patch plate over it if you’ve got one.”  

I key Dock Control. “Stop forcing. Get me a welder and a brace team at this hatch—now. We’re sealing it from our side.”

I key Dock Control. “Stop forcing. Send a welder and a brace team to this hatch—now. We’re sealing it from our side.”

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is jammed and a feeler is already probing through the notch—if I let it anchor, we’re done. I need to immobilize and remove it fast, then hard-seal the notch with foam and a plate while Dock brings welding gear and bracing.*

#### Turn 165 **[GAME]**

Your heel comes down on the segmented feeler right at the lower-left notch.

It doesn’t squish like flesh. It **cracks** like layered plastic, then flexes and tries to snake sideways under your boot, searching for purchase along the foam-slick metal. You grind down harder until it stops moving.

You jam the bayonet into the notch and saw.

The blade bites, grates, then suddenly gives—**a wet snap**. Gray-clear fluid jets out in a short pulse, spattering your boot and the hatch lip. The severed tip whips once and goes limp, still twitching in tiny reflexes against the foam.

The part you didn’t get—the “root”—**yanks back** through the notch with enough force to drag a ribbon of foam with it. The foam plug you’d started is now torn into a ragged channel again.

Containment doesn’t need a second order. The nozzle operator, face white under his visor, crawls up from the safe angle and dumps foam into the lower-left gap until it bulges outward. Another tech slaps a quick-seal patch from his kit over the bulge—but it’s made for pinholes, not a stressed notch. The adhesive grabs, then immediately starts to **peel at one corner** as pressure from the other side pulses against it.

“Patch won’t hold on shear!” the tech barks, palms flat, trying to keep it seated. “Need a hard plate or a brace!”

Dock Control answers your key: “Forcing stopped. Welder team en route—fastest ETA three minutes. Brace crew behind them.”

Three minutes is an eternity here.

The hatch shudders once—testing. Not a slam this time, a **steady push**. The misaligned petal creaks, and the patched corner lifts another millimeter. Through the foam you see a thin **dark line** form under the patch edge, like something is prying a fingernail under it.

Then the clicking returns—closer than before—no longer outside the corridor. It’s coming from **inside the seam**, as if whatever’s there has gotten its mouthparts into the notch and is working the material.

Containment lead steps in front of his people with a cutter he shouldn’t have on a dock. “Mara—if that patch lets go, it’s coming through at knee height.”

The immediate threat is the lower-left notch: the foam is being pulled and pulsed from the far side, the patch is peeling, and something is actively prying at the seam while you wait on welders.

Containment scrambles instantly.

A dockhand rips a **stanchion post** out of its base and two others shove a **tool case** up under it to get the angle. They drive the post into the lower-left corner of the hatch frame and lean their combined weight inward. Metal shrieks. The hatch’s petal stops creeping—barely.

You tear the peeling patch free. The adhesive comes off in a long string, snapping back onto your glove.

Off-angle, you slam the bayonet into the foam-packed notch and twist hard.

For a half-second it feels like you’ve found purchase—then the bayonet point hits something that **moves against the steel**, not away from it. The clicking spikes into a rapid chatter, right up the blade. Your wrist jolts as if something bit down on the metal.

You fire.

Short bursts. Controlled. The muzzle flash strobes the foam into dirty white chunks. The rounds don’t “ping” like they’re hitting empty void—they thud and **skip**, as if striking layered composite and wet metal. Gray-clear fluid erupts again, atomized into a mist that coats the foam and your forearm.

Then: **silence** from the notch. No clicking.

But the consequences land immediately.

The foam you just shot through **slumps** and starts to dissolve where the fluid hit it, turning to a slick, sagging paste. A thin stream runs down the hatch lip and onto the deck, smoking faintly as it reacts with grime. The bayonet is still wedged—now vibrating in tiny, diminishing tremors like a tuning fork.

Dock Guard #2, who’d moved in to help brace, jerks back as the runoff touches his boot. “Shit—burn!” He hops, swearing, and one of the containment techs drags him away before he slips in it.

The stanchion team yells over each other:
“Pressure’s changing!”
“It’s pulling—no, it’s *setting*—”
The hatch doesn’t push anymore. It goes **dead weight**, like whatever was on the other side stopped pressing entirely.

Then a new sound replaces it: a **slow creak** from higher on the hatch seam—upper-right quadrant—like tension migrating. The braced corner holds, but the stress line has shifted.

Dock Control cuts back in your ear, tight: “Welder team at Tube 9 junction—ninety seconds.”

Right now the threat isn’t the notch you silenced; it’s the hatch **redistributing force**. If the upper-right seam gives, it’ll open a new gap above the brace line—head height—without warning.

#### Turn 170 **[PLAYER]**

“Everyone off the hatch face—NOW. Brace team, keep that stanchion but get low and to the side; nobody stands in front of the seam.”

I point up at the upper-right quadrant. “You—get a second stanchion or pry bar up there and wedge it. Tool case, crate, whatever—build a jack stack.”

I backstep to a hard angle, rifle up on the upper-right seam. “If it opens, I’m shooting the first thing that shows—don’t cross my line. Dock Control, welder team comes in on my left only.”

*Agent reasoning: New gap risk at head height means someone’s getting sliced open if it pops; I need bodies out of the kill zone, a brace up high, and eyes on that seam until the welders arrive.*

#### Turn 171 **[GAME]**

People move the moment you bark it.

Containment lead shoves two techs backward by their harness rings. “Off the face! Low, low—sidewall!” The brace team keeps the lower-left stanchion planted but drops to a crouch behind it, shoulders turned away from the seam. The tool case stack stays, but one guy kicks it tighter under the post so it can’t skate on the slick runoff.

A dockhand sprints for more gear—comes back dragging a second stanchion and a length of pry bar scavenged from a maintenance cart. They start building a “jack stack” under the upper-right: crate, then a hard case, then the stanchion angled up to bite the frame. It’s improvisation—good instinct, bad materials. The stack wobbles once, then steadies as two bodies pin it from the side.

You backstep to a hard angle and bring the rifle up on the upper-right seam.

Dock Control, breathy and fast in your ear: “Copy. Welder team routed left approach only. They’re moving.”

The upper-right seam gives a sound like a ship’s rib cracking—**a long, wet metal groan**. A hairline gap opens there, not wide—two fingers at most—but it’s enough.

Something extrudes.

Not a limb this time. A **thin, flat strip**, like a laminate tongue or a cable sheath, slides out and hangs for a beat—then **splits** into three filaments at the end, tasting the air. It doesn’t rush. It *samples*, sweeping side to side, pausing whenever it points toward a warm body.

One of the brace guys, crouched too close, flinches and shifts his knee. The filament snaps toward the motion with a sharp, insectile **tick** and taps the hull—*tick-tick*—as if mapping.

Containment lead hisses, “Don’t move. Don’t—”

The new upper-right brace stack shudders as pressure changes behind the hatch. The stanchion head bites, then slips a millimeter, leaving a bright gouge in the frame. The gap widens a fraction more.

Welder team appears at your left corridor mouth—two in arc hoods, one carrying a plate, all of them stopping dead when they see the thing in the seam.

The threat is now **a probing appendage** actively searching and a seam that is **opening at head height**; if it finds purchase, it can pull the gap wider faster than your braces can hold.

#### Turn 172 **[PLAYER]**

I put two tight bursts into the filament cluster right at the split, then a third burst into the seam behind it to chew away anything trying to anchor. “Welders—plate OVER that gap, tack it NOW; I don’t care if it’s ugly. Brace team, shove that upper stanchion harder—make it bite.”

*Agent reasoning: That probe is scouting for leverage; if it finds purchase we lose the seam. I’ll kill it fast, then force the welders to plate and tack immediately while braces hold—no hesitation.*

#### Turn 173 **[GAME]**

Your first two bursts hit the filament cluster right at the split.

The filaments don’t spray blood; they **snap and fray** like layered polymer under heat, whipping back into the seam. The impact makes a sound like wet tape tearing. A clear-gray mist puffs out with it—same reactive fluid as before—spattering the hatch face in a constellation of droplets.

Your third burst goes into the seam behind it.

The rounds chew the edge of the hatch frame and whatever’s just inside. You feel it in the recoil: not empty space—**dense resistance**, then a sudden give. The gap widens by a sliver under the shock, and something inside **pulls back** hard, like it just lost grip.

For half a breath, it looks like you bought space.

Then the runoff fluid hits the upper brace stack. It doesn’t ignite; it **eats**. The top hard case hisses and softens where droplets land, its corner deforming, shifting the stanchion’s angle. The brace team shoves harder as you order, boots sliding on the slick deck—one guy drops to a knee to get leverage, gritting, “It’s moving—keep it—KEEP IT—”

The welders move on your left, fast and disciplined. The Team Lead slaps a plate up over the breach with insulated gloves. “Arc on—stand clear!”

He strikes. The arc flares blue-white, and the first tack *sticks*—then immediately **pops**, spitting molten metal as the plate vibrates from pressure behind it. The second tack holds for a second longer, drawing a bead—

—and the seam **exhales**.

Not air. A pulse of that clear-gray vapor and fine particulate blasts out around the plate edges, forcing the welder’s hood back with a sharp *clack*. Both techs stagger, coughing inside their masks. The bead goes ugly, blistering as if the metal is contaminated.

Behind the plate, you hear the clicking again—faster now, excited—coming from *two points*: the original notch you “silenced” and the upper-right, answering each other like call-and-response.

Threat, clear: your fire drove the probe back, but the breach is now **actively pressurizing and venting reactive vapor** that degrades supports and fouls welds, and the thing behind the hatch has **multiple contact points**—it can shift where it pushes faster than your braces can be rebuilt.

#### Turn 174 **[PLAYER]**

“Welders, STOP—back out, masks on, you’re breathing poison. Everyone fall back to the junction—now!”

I key Dock Control. “We need hard plates and mechanical clamps—hatch dog bars, cargo straps, anything that can cinch steel. And purge this section: vent the corridor to vacuum if you can, scrubbers max if you can’t.”

I jab the rifle toward the hatch. “Brace team, hold until the last second—then peel off left. If anything comes through, I’m cutting it in half. Move!”

*Agent reasoning: The vapor is eating supports and ruining welds; holding this hatch is failing. I need to pull people back, isolate the area, and switch to a more brute-force seal: hard plates plus mechanical clamps, then vent/purge the corridor.*

#### Turn 175 **[GAME]**

The welders obey immediately.

Team Lead chops the arc. “Off! Off!” He yanks his hood seal tighter and physically shoves Tech #1 back by the shoulder. Both techs retreat left, coughing hard—wet, panicked coughs inside their masks. One spits into his sleeve and looks at the smear on the fabric like he doesn’t understand what he’s seeing.

Containment lead starts herding everyone toward the junction, palms out. “Back! Don’t run—don’t slip in that shit!”

Your order to fall back works—mostly. People peel off in a staggered line, staying out of your lane.

Dock Control comes back sharp, with real strain in it: “Negative on vent-to-vacuum from Dock 9 tube. That corridor is tied into station pressure integrity—if I dump it, I dump half the spindle ring. I can max scrubbers and isolate local returns. Clamps and dog bars inbound—cargo crew is stripping Bay 4 tie-downs now. ETA three minutes.”

At the hatch, the brace team holds as told—two crouched behind the lower-left stanchion, two pinning the upper-right improvised stack.

The reactive vapor keeps seeping around the ugly tack-welded plate—thin, pulsing breaths. Each pulse makes the plate **tick** and flex like a drum skin. The clear-gray residue continues to bead and run; where it touches the upper stack, the hard case corner slumps further, and the stanchion angle changes again—less bite, more slide.

Then the clicking changes character: it stops being “from the seam” and becomes **inside the hatch frame**, like something has moved into the thickness of the metal.

A new sound follows: a slow, deliberate **ratcheting**—as if teeth are climbing the hatch dogs from the inside.

Brace guy on the upper stack blurts, voice cracking, “It’s not pushing— it’s *unlatching*—”

The upper-right brace slips another centimeter. The plate jerks outward at the top edge, and a **dark line** appears behind it—an inner gap widening.

Your retreat order creates distance, but the threat escalates: whatever is behind the hatch is now **working the hatch hardware**, and the compromised upper brace is losing its bite under chemical degradation. If the hatch dogs release, the hatch won’t “creep” anymore—it will **snap open** under stored pressure, sending the plate and any nearby bodies into the corridor like shrapnel.

#### Turn 176 **[PLAYER]**

“Brace team, ABANDON—left, NOW! Everybody to the junction, heads down!”

I sprint in low on the hinge side, slam my bayonet into the dog track through the widening upper-right gap to jam the ratchet, then immediately peel back and dump a burst into the hatch dog housing to try to shred the mechanism. “Control—get me an emergency bulkhead door between us and that hatch, NOW!”

*Agent reasoning: It’s about to snap open; waiting for clamps is death. I need to deny the hatch hardware—either jam the dogs or destroy the mechanism—and get my people clear before it blows.*

#### Turn 177 **[GAME]**

“ABANDON—left, NOW!” gets answered with pure survival.

The upper brace pair breaks first—hands off, bodies sliding left on the slick deck. One nearly goes down; the containment lead catches his harness and yanks him upright. The lower-left brace team peels a half-second later, stanchion clanging as it’s left behind.

That half-second is all you have.

You sprint in low on the hinge side. The upper-right gap is now wide enough to see the dog track—metal teeth and a moving pawl, working itself free with that slow ratchet. You drive the bayonet in hard.

It *catches*.

The ratcheting stops dead with a metallic **clunk** that you feel up your arm. For a heartbeat, the whole hatch face shudders—pressure loading against your jam.

Then something on the other side **tests** it: a heavy, controlled push. The bayonet flexes. Your glove vibrates on the hilt like it’s pressed against a running motor.

You peel back as you planned and dump a burst into the dog housing.

Rounds punch into the frame—sparks, torn alloy, and a spray of that clear-gray residue kicked out by impacts. The housing deforms; the hatch dogs *don’t* finish unlatching, but the mechanism is now partially shredded and **misaligned**. It won’t cycle cleanly either way.

Consequence: the hatch doesn’t snap open… but it also doesn’t seal. It’s stuck in a dangerous middle state: jammed and damaged, holding pressure in uneven pulses.

The ugly-welded plate over the upper-right breach tears loose at one corner from the next “exhale” and whips outward, clanging off the abandoned stanchion and skittering across the deck toward the junction like a thrown shield. It stops short of the retreating crew by a meter, spinning to a halt.

One welder screams, “Plate! PLATE!” and ducks behind the junction bulkhead lip.

Dock Control, strained: “Emergency bulkhead is two sections back—manual close only. I can’t drop anything between you and that hatch from here. Closest is Junction 3A-19 iris—if you’re at it, you can slam it.”

At the hatch, behind the jammed dogs, you hear a new sound: a **thin scraping** along the inside of the frame, moving away from the dog track—like it’s changing approach. The clear-gray vapor continues to pulse out around your bullet holes and the widened seam, drifting low along the deck toward you and the junction.

Threat, explicit: the hatch is **no longer opening normally**, but whatever’s inside is still active and now probing for another weak point; meanwhile the corridor is accumulating **reactive vapor** that’s spreading toward your fallback position.

#### Turn 178 **[PLAYER]**

I wave everyone back hard toward Junction 3A-19. “Move! Past the iris—don’t breathe that shit!”

I backpedal with the rifle up, covering the hatch, and bark to Dock Control, “I’m at 3A-19—cycle it shut the instant we’re clear, then isolate this run and crank scrubbers. If you can’t vent, flood it with inert.”

As the last person clears, I grab the manual close and slam the iris down, then post up on the safe side with the muzzle trained on the seam line. “Nobody opens that door for anything.”

*Agent reasoning: The vapor’s spreading and the hatch is stuck but still active; the only real containment is slamming the iris and isolating the section. I’ll force everyone behind it, then shut it and vent/flush this corridor. If something darts out before closure, I’ll hose it down while moving.*

#### Turn 179 **[GAME]**

They move.

Your arm sweep and tone cut through the panic; the welders and brace team funnel past you toward Junction 3A-19, heads down, hands over mask seals. One of the Helix cargo hands tries to look back; the containment lead hooks his vest and yanks him forward. “Eyes front—MOVE.”

You backpedal with the rifle up. The vapor is pooling low now, a knee-high haze that curls around boots and the abandoned stanchion legs. It doesn’t burn your visor, but your suit’s external chem sensor starts throwing intermittent *VOC/unknown reactive* spikes—enough to justify the urgency.

Dock Control answers over the channel, voice tight: “Copy. Isolating local returns and pushing scrubbers to max. Inert flood available—stand by to confirm seal at 3A-19.”

The last welder clears the iris—Tech #2—half-stumbling, one hand clamped to his throat mic like he’s trying not to cough. You grab the manual close and throw your weight into it.

The iris **drops and locks** with a heavy, satisfying *thoom* and a ring of latches snapping home. The seam line around the door flickers with a status strip: amber to green. Pressure equalizes on your side with a soft hiss; the haze on your side thins as the scrubbers bite.

On the far side of the iris—muffled through the door—you hear it: a single, deliberate **impact** against metal, like a shoulder test. Then a second, slightly higher, as if whatever’s there is mapping the iris’s ribs.

A voice crackles on your comms—Dock Guard #2, somewhere behind you at the junction, weapon up: “Vance, we’re sealed. But… you should see this.”

He angles his light down at the deck plating by your boots.

In the condensation and residue, a fresh **handprint** has appeared on *your* side of the iris—oil-black, partial, smeared as if pressed from the inside of the metal. Five long finger marks, too narrow at the joints. It wasn’t there when you slammed the door.

Dock Control: “Seal confirmed. Inert flood commencing on the isolated run. You are green on station side. Do **not** cycle that iris.”

Threat is immediate and concrete: something remains active on the isolated side and is now testing the barrier, while evidence (the handprint) suggests contamination or contact has already crossed the seal—whether through vapor, residue, or something worse.

#### Turn 180 **[PLAYER]**

I snap my rifle up and sweep the floor-to-waistline around the iris, then jab a finger at the print. “Nobody steps in that residue—back up, now. Guard, tape off a five-meter arc; guns on the door, low angle.”

I key Dock Control. “That iris is leaking or something’s already through—get HazMat and a chem/biomed scan team here, and lock down Junction 3A-19 on both sides. Flood this side with inert too if you can without dropping O2.”

I crouch and flick my suit light across the handprint and the seam, looking for smears, tracks, or anything moving. “Containment lead—count heads and check suits. Anybody coughing or with a compromised seal goes to med quarantine immediately.”

*Agent reasoning: That handprint means it’s already on our side or the seal is compromised; I’m not waiting for it to “test” again. I need containment, scans, and a kill zone—fast.*

#### Turn 182 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my rifle trained low on the iris seam and bark, “Nobody crosses that print—back up five meters, weapons on the door.”  

I key Dock Control. “Status update—are you flooding the isolated run? I need HazMat and a scan team at Junction 3A-19 now, and lock this junction down both sides.”  

I crouch, sweep my suit light along the seam and the black handprint, looking for wet sheen, airflow, smears, or any tracks leading away. “Containment lead—count heads and check seals. Anyone coughing or with a bad mask goes straight to med quarantine.”

*Agent reasoning: The scene didn’t update, so I’ll reassert immediate containment orders and demand status from Dock Control while I physically inspect the iris/seal for leaks or residue trails.*

#### Turn 183 **[GAME]**

Your order lands. People actually listen.

Dock Guard #2 backs up first, boots squeaking on the damp deck, then throws out a roll of hazard tape from his belt kit. He anchors it to a conduit bracket and makes a quick five‑meter arc around the iris, keeping his pistol low and steady. “Five meters. Nobody crosses,” he repeats, eyes fixed on the seam.

The containment lead starts counting out loud, physically grabbing shoulders and checking faceplates and suit rings with a gloved hand. “Nine… ten… eleven… Tech Two, visor seal—hold still.” Tech #2’s breathing is fast and wet in his mic; not a full cough, but close. The lead points hard toward the corridor back to station-side med. “You. Quarantine. Now. Escort him.”

Dock Control comes back immediately. “Isolated run is flooding inert now—argon mix. Scrubbers at max. Lockdown on both sides of 3A-19 is in progress; I can hard-lock the station-side access in thirty seconds. HazMat team is en route, ETA four minutes—biomed scanner with them. Do you need us to inert-flood *your* side?” There’s a pause, then: “Be advised: inert on your side will drop O2 partial. You’ll need masks sealed or suit feed.”

You crouch and rake your light along the iris seam and the oil-black print.

Concrete: the print has a wet sheen that **shouldn’t** be there in this cold air. Under the beam it glitters like thin oil, and you can see a faint *drag*—a narrow smear leading away from the palm toward the left, about thirty centimeters, then stopping as if whatever made it lifted clean.

At the bottom of the iris seam, your light catches something worse: a **steady, tiny stream of vapor** feathering out—more like breath through a pinhole than residual haze. It curls along the deck and *threads* toward the handprint, as if drawn to it.

On the other side of the door, the impacts stop. Replaced by a slow, rasping **scrape** that travels downward along the iris ribs, ending near that same bottom seam—like something aligning itself with the leak.

Threat, explicit: the iris is not a perfect seal; there is an active **leak path** at the lower seam, and whatever is on the far side has noticed it and is working that exact point while inert flooding continues behind it.

#### Turn 184 **[PLAYER]**

I jab two fingers at Dock Guard #2. “You—keep that arc tight. If anything oozes under that seam, you shoot it. Low angle only.”

I key Dock Control. “Don’t inert-flood our side yet. I need pressure on my side *higher* than the isolated run—give me a slight overpress and push scrubbers; I’m sealing a leak at the bottom seam. And kill power to that iris actuator—hard lock only.”

I rip a roll of seal tape/patch from the nearest kit and slap it over the bottom seam, then brace my boot and hammer a maintenance wedge or prybar into the seam lip to crimp it shut. “Containment lead—get everyone another ten meters back and seal masks. HazMat better bring a damn torch.”

*Agent reasoning: There’s a leak at the bottom seam and something is targeting it; waiting four minutes is asking to get breached. I need to hard-seal the seam fast with brute force and keep everyone back, then get atmosphere control to help without asphyxiating us.*

I jab two fingers at Dock Guard #2. “Hold that five-meter arc. If anything oozes under that seam, you put rounds into it—low angle only.”

I key Dock Control. “No inert flood on our side. Give me slight overpressure station-side and max scrubbers; and kill power to the iris actuator—hard lock only.”

I rip seal tape from the nearest kit and slap a patch over the bottom seam, then drive a maintenance wedge/prybar into the seam lip and crank it to crimp the leak shut. “Containment lead—everyone ten meters back, masks sealed. HazMat better show up ready to cut metal.”

*Agent reasoning: We’ve got an active leak at the bottom seam and something on the other side is working it. I’m not waiting for HazMat while it breathes through—seal it, increase overpressure on our side, and keep guns trained low for anything that slips under.*

#### Turn 187 **[GAME]**

Dock Guard #2 tightens his stance, knees bent, pistol canted down. “Copy. Low angle.” He keeps the hazard-tape arc intact, but his eyes flick to your hands as you move in—ready to fire if something breaks the line.

Dock Control answers over the open channel, voice clipped as systems obey. “Roger. No inert on your side. Station-side overpressure coming up point-two bar. Scrubbers maxed.” A half-second later: “Iris actuator power is cut. Hard-lock engaged.” You hear it through the door more than you feel it: a dull *clunk* as the mechanism deadens and stops hunting.

The pressure change is immediate in the small of your ears, like a slow squeeze. The vapor feathering out of the bottom seam thins, then reverses—now it’s being pushed *in* toward the isolated run. The “breath” effect dies.

You snatch seal tape from the nearest kit—Dock Guard #1’s belt pouch is already torn open from earlier, tape roll half-spooled. You slap it over the bottom seam. The tape adheres, but the surface beneath it is slick; the edge wants to curl until you press hard with your glove and drag it flat.

When you drive the wedge/prybar into the seam lip and crank, metal protests. The iris rib flexes a few millimeters, enough to pinch the leak line—then it catches on something rigid inside the seam.

A sharp *tink*—your wedge bites, then skates. The tool jerks, and for a split second the seam opens wider than before.

Something **threads out**: not a limb, not fluid—more like a black, hair-thin filament that whips into the gap, testing the air. Dock Guard #2 fires once, exactly where you told him—low, into the deck line.

The round sparks off the iris lip and punches into the deck plating with a flat *whap*. The filament snaps back instantly, leaving a tiny crescent of wet black on the edge of your tape. The tape bubbles where it’s touched, as if warmed from underneath.

Containment lead waves people back hard. “TEN METERS. MASKS—SEAL THEM NOW.” Two weld techs stumble over each other retreating; one slaps his own throat mic like it’s choking him, then clamps his visor ring tighter.

Threat, explicit: whatever is behind the iris can extend a thin probing filament through any momentary gap, and it reacts to air pressure; your crimp reduced the leak, but the seam is now **mechanically hung** on something inside, and your patch is degrading where it was contacted.

I yank the prybar back and snarl, “No more prying—door stays shut.”

I thumb my comm. “Dock Control, that seam’s compromised and it’s probing through—route me a fire suppression canister or foam line to 3A-19, now. Also get a thermal cam on this iris from your side if you can; I want to see where it’s hot.”

I point at Guard #2. “Two-shot bursts only if it shows again—aim for the filament, not the door.” Then I grab a second strip of tape and slap it over the bubbled spot as a sacrificial layer, keeping my hands clear of the seam. “Containment lead—nobody talks, nobody panics; just keep them back and sealed until HazMat cuts this thing open on our terms.”

*Agent reasoning: That filament and bubbling tape means contact is corrosive/heat-reactive; prying risked opening the seam. I need standoff, reinforce without widening the gap, and prep to burn/kill anything that probes again while HazMat arrives.*

#### Turn 189 **[GAME]**

You yank the prybar free. The iris lip snaps back a fraction with a metallic *ping*, but the seam doesn’t re-open—your earlier crimp and the overpressure keep it pinned tight. The bubbled patch you laid down sizzles softly for two seconds… then goes still, leaving a puckered, glossy blister the size of a thumbnail.

Dock Control comes back fast. “Copy: probing filament. Fire suppression—routing a portable AFFF canister and a foam line from Dock 9 manifold. Nearest responder is the welder lead with a canister; ETA ninety seconds.” A beat. “Thermal: I can give you station-side thermals on the iris housing through the bulkhead sensors, not a camera view. Sending overlay to your visor now.”

Your visor pings and paints a crude heat map. Most of the iris reads cold-blue. The bottom seam you patched shows a thin orange arc—localized heat, like friction or something metabolizing just beneath the metal. It isn’t spreading, but it pulses: brighten… dim… brighten, in a slow rhythm that doesn’t match any station cycle.

Guard #2 nods without taking his eyes off the seam. “Two-shot. Filament only.” He adjusts his angle so his rounds would rake *outward* into open deck, not into the door frame.

You lay down a second strip of tape over the blistered spot. It sticks, but the moment your glove pressure lifts, the outer layer dimples inward as if something on the other side briefly *sips* at it—then releases. No breakthrough, just a visible tug that leaves a shallow concavity in the tape.

Containment lead herds the crew back another ten meters, physically placing himself between them and the taped seam. “Nobody talks on open mics,” he barks. “If you feel dizzy, you signal me—hand up, no words.” He makes each person check their seals by tapping visor rims and pulling on mask straps until he’s satisfied.

From behind the iris, you hear that rasping scrape again—lower now, directly behind your patch—followed by a single, deliberate *tap* against the metal, like a knuckle testing a wall.

Threat, explicit: the thing behind the iris is concentrating at the heated bottom seam and can apply suction/pressure through micro-gaps; your sacrificial tape is buying time, but it’s being tested and deformed, and the rhythm in the thermal overlay suggests active, intentional contact rather than passive leakage.

#### Turn 190 **[PLAYER]**

I back up to the edge of the tape arc, rifle up, and snap, “Everyone stays behind the line—no heroes.”

I key Dock Control. “Increase station-side overpressure another notch if you can without stressing bulkheads—keep that seam blowing *in* to the isolated run. And vent the isolated run down to vacuum if you’ve got remote authority; I want whatever’s in there starving.”

I point at Guard #2 and the containment lead. “You two—set a crossfire. If that filament shows, pin it with two-shot bursts and I’ll foam the seam.”

I ready my extinguisher/utility sprayer if I have one; otherwise I wait for the AFFF canister and, the moment it arrives, I blast a thick bead of foam along the bottom seam and over the tape to choke the micro-gaps and mark any movement. “HazMat’s not cutting anything until we freeze this thing in place.”

*Agent reasoning: It’s actively working the seam; I want to deny it airflow and blind-probe space with foam while we wait, and I’m not letting anyone stand close if it pops. If it wants in, it comes through a kill zone on my terms.*

#### Turn 191 **[GAME]**

#### Turn 192 **[PLAYER]**

I fall back to the edge of the tape arc, rifle up. “Everyone stays behind the line—no heroes.”

I key Dock Control. “Bump station-side overpressure one notch if it won’t stress bulkheads—keep that seam blowing *in*. If you’ve got remote authority, vent the isolated run down toward vacuum; starve whatever’s in there.”

I point at Guard #2 and the containment lead. “Set a crossfire. Filament shows, two-shot bursts to pin it—then I foam the seam.”

If I’ve got any sprayer, I ready it; otherwise the second that AFFF canister hits my hands, I lay a thick bead of foam along the bottom seam and over the tape, watching for ripples or tunneling. “HazMat doesn’t cut until we freeze it in place.”

*Agent reasoning: The seam is being actively probed; I want to deny airflow, buy time, and set up immediate suppression if it pushes through. Overpressure and vacuuming the isolated run are blunt tools that might starve it, while crossfire + foam gives us control without opening the door.*

#### Turn 193 **[GAME]**

#### Turn 194 **[PLAYER]**

I shoulder my rifle at the tape-line edge. “Behind the line. No heroes.”

I key Dock Control. “Overpressure up one notch—keep it blowing *in*. And vent the isolated run toward vacuum if you’ve got remote authority; starve it.”

I jab at Guard #2 and the containment lead. “Crossfire here and here. Filament shows, two-shot bursts to pin—no door strikes.”

I grab the AFFF canister the second it arrives and lay a thick bead of foam along the entire bottom seam and over the tape, watching for ripples, tunneling, or any spot that drinks the foam. “HazMat doesn’t cut until this thing’s frozen in place.”

*Agent reasoning: The seam is actively testing the patch; I want maximum pressure advantage and to deny it atmosphere, then physically choke the micro-gaps with foam while setting disciplined fields of fire.*

#### Turn 195 **[GAME]**



*Simulation triggers: guard_Hub To Discourage Whatever’s Leaning_1_300984, fail_Hell_0_5653a1, watcher_Hell_1_73a8a1, secret_Hell_0_36cb01, secret_Hell_1_4f0844*

#### Turn 196 **[PLAYER]**

I snap on comms, “Dock Control—confirm: overpressure increased and isolated run venting toward vacuum. Give me live thermal on that bottom seam—any change in that pulse?”

I level my rifle at the seam and bark, “Crossfire set now. Two-shot bursts on filament only—no door strikes.” 

I grab the first foam/AFFF that arrives and smear a thick bead across the entire bottom seam and over the tape, then hold position and watch for any spot that tunnels, ripples, or “drinks” the foam.

*Agent reasoning: Nothing new is being shown—either a glitch or the scene stalled. I’m aggressive and I need actionable intel fast, so I’ll force an update: confirm Dock Control actions, get eyes on the seam/thermals, and push foam deployment while setting a firing plan.*

#### Turn 197 **[GAME]**

Dock Control comes back a half-second late, voice pinched with strain and background alarms. “Node 3A-19, copy. Station-side overpressure bumped one notch. Bulkhead stress within green—barely. Isolated run… standby…”

A second voice cuts in—someone higher up, calmer. “Remote authority denied. That run’s tied into Dock 9’s life-support trunk. We can’t hard-vent without purging the whole finger. We *can* throttle it and lock dampers.”

Your visor pings as Dock Control pushes a thermal feed overlay. The bottom-right seam shows a thin, repeating temperature dip—like a pulse of cold—every three seconds. As the overpressure increases, the pulse doesn’t stop; it shifts. The cold dip tightens into a smaller spot, concentrating near the upper-right seam breach you already clocked, then spreads back out like it’s testing the boundary.

Guard #2 moves when you bark—boots scuffing on grit—taking a knee to your left with his rifle braced on a bollard. The containment lead—arc-hood still down, faceplate reflecting red strip lights—positions opposite, behind a portable tool cart. “Crossfire set,” the lead says, and you hear their breath rasp through a filter. “We’re not shooting unless you call it.”

The first AFFF canister gets shoved into your hands by a welder tech in nitrile gloves. You lay a thick bead along the bottom seam and over the tape.

At first, it looks good—white foam swelling, sealing the gap.

Then three things happen, clear as a checklist:

1) A narrow channel opens in the foam dead center of the seam—no spray, no airflow you can feel—just a clean tunnel as if something slid beneath it. The foam collapses inward along that line.

2) Near the upper-right seam breach, the foam *darkens* in a thumbnail-sized patch, turning gray and wet, as if it’s being dissolved from underneath. That patch “drinks” the foam faster than you can lay it down.

3) The thermal overlay spikes: the cold pulse stops being rhythmic and becomes continuous at that dissolving patch—steady, deep cold.

From inside the hatch, you get a sound like a fingernail dragged along metal—slow, deliberate—tracking along the seam under the foam.

The weld-drone above you twitches on its mag-clamps, rotates its head toward the breach, and emits a short, chirping error tone as if its proximity sensors just went blind.

*Simulation triggers: guard_Hub To Discourage Whatever’s Leaning_1_300984, fail_Hell_0_5653a1, watcher_Hell_1_73a8a1, secret_Hell_0_36cb01, secret_Hell_1_4f0844*

#### Turn 198 **[PLAYER]**

I snap my rifle to the upper-right breach. “There—cold spot. Guard #2, you see filament, you stitch that exact point—two shots, repeat. Lead, same.”

I key Dock Control hard. “Throttle and lock those dampers *now*. I want that run isolated as far as you can make it. And get me a clamp kit and a patch plate—mag-clamps, anything—plus HazMat on the move.”

I shove the AFFF nozzle right onto the dissolving patch and dump foam until it domes up, then I grab the nearest hard tool—spare steel plate, cart panel, anything flat—and slam it over the breach like a shield. “Tech—hold this plate with me. If it moves, you let go and get back.”

Without waiting for permission, I bark, “Welder—give me a hot tack line around the plate edge. Fast. We seal it or we shoot it.”

*Agent reasoning: The foam is getting tunneled and dissolved at the upper-right breach where the cold concentrates—it's the active point. I need to deny it the gap and stop it from expanding, even if I have to burn or clamp the area. I’ll also force Dock Control to throttle/lock dampers and bring HazMat/cutting gear now while we hold crossfire.*

#### Turn 199 **[GAME]**



*Simulation triggers: guard_Hub To Discourage Whatever’s Leaning_1_300984, fail_Hell_0_5653a1, watcher_Hell_1_73a8a1, secret_Hell_0_36cb01, secret_Hell_1_4f0844*

#### Turn 200 **[PLAYER]**

I snap my rifle to the upper-right breach. “There—cold spot. Guard #2, you see filament, you stitch that exact point—two shots, repeat. Lead, mirror him.”

I key Dock Control. “Throttle and lock every damper you can to isolate that run. I want a clamp kit and patch plate—mag clamps, whatever you’ve got—*now*. And HazMat moving.”

I shove the AFFF nozzle into the dissolving patch and dump foam until it domes, then rip a flat panel off the tool cart and slam it over the breach. “You—hands on this with me. If it bucks, you drop and back off.”

I bark up at the weld-drone. “Hot tack around the plate edge—fast. Seal it or we start shooting.”

*Agent reasoning: The cold spot is the active breach; foam is getting eaten and something is moving under it. I need immediate isolation, physical occlusion, and a quick tack to buy time—while keeping crossfire disciplined.*

#### Turn 201 **[GAME]**



*Simulation triggers: guard_Hub To Discourage Whatever’s Leaning_1_300984, fail_Hell_0_5653a1, watcher_Hell_1_73a8a1, secret_Hell_0_36cb01, secret_Hell_1_4f0844*

#### Turn 202 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my rifle trained on the upper-right breach. “Guard #2—containment lead—eyes on that exact cold patch. Filament shows, you stitch it: two-shot bursts, same point, again.”

I key Dock Control. “Lock and throttle every damper you can—now. Get me mag-clamps, a patch plate, and HazMat moving or I’m sealing it myself with scrap.”

I jam the AFFF nozzle into the dissolving spot and flood it until it domes, then yank a flat panel off the nearest cart and slam it over the breach. “Tech—help me hold this. If it bucks, you let go and get behind the line.”

I shout at the weld-drone. “Hot tack around the plate edge—fast. Seal it.”

*Agent reasoning: We can’t talk this thing down; the breach is actively dissolving foam and “feeling” along the seam. I’m forcing isolation, pinning it with fire if it shows, and mechanically sealing the spot with a plate and hot tacks before it spreads.*

#### Turn 203 **[GAME]**

Guard #2 and the containment lead both shift their aim to the same thumbnail-sized cold patch. You see their muzzles settle, disciplined, waiting for something to *show itself*.

Dock Control answers over your open channel, rushed. “Throttling now—stand by—” A clack of relays. “Dampers 9-Finger A and C locked. B is… not responding. We can’t get full isolation from here. Pressure’s stabilizing but you’ve still got bleed-through.”

You bury the AFFF nozzle into the dissolving spot and dump. The foam swells into a dome—then the center of it *hollows* like it’s being sucked into a straw. The gray wet patch expands under the foam, eating it from below in a clean circle.

You rip a flat side panel off the tool cart—thin steel, bent at one corner—and slap it over the breach. A tech grabs the opposite edge with you, knuckles white through gloves.

For half a second it holds.

Then the panel twitches—one sharp *tap* from the other side—followed by a slow, steady push. Not a blow. A measured pressure, like someone leaning their shoulder into it and testing your grip. The AFFF trapped under the panel hisses as it compresses.

Above, the weld-drone chirps again, rotates its torch head toward the plate edge… and then pauses. Its arm jitters, as if its control loop can’t find a stable surface. It lowers the tip anyway and spits a short tack.

The tack doesn’t spark the way it should. The molten bead flashes dull, then instantly frosts over, turning grainy and white. The drone recoils and squeals a higher error tone.

At the same moment, Guard #2 barks, “Filament—there!” You see it: a hair-thin black line extrudes from the seam just beside your plate, not whipping like a wire—*feeling* along the foam, tracing toward the tech’s glove.

Guard #2 fires two tight shots into the exact point. The rounds punch the hatch face with sharp metallic cracks. The filament snaps back—gone—leaving behind two tiny holes that immediately rim with hoarfrost.

The pressure behind your panel increases. The tech grunts, boots sliding a few centimeters. “It’s pushing,” he says, voice breaking. “Mara—”

Dock Control, louder now: “Clamp kit is en route from Bay 4. HazMat’s two minutes out. Vents are holding at 1.2 over—B damper still stuck.”

The threat is now clear and physical: something cold and forceful is pressing from inside at the upper-right breach, and it can extend a thin, searching filament through any gap—fast enough to reach for exposed hands if you give it a path.

*Simulation triggers: guard_Hub To Discourage Whatever’s Leaning_1_300984, fail_Hell_0_5653a1, watcher_Hell_1_73a8a1, secret_Hell_0_36cb01, secret_Hell_1_4f0844*

#### Turn 204 **[PLAYER]**

“Tech—drop back behind the line. Now. I’m not losing your hand to that thing.”

I jam the panel harder into the breach and brace it with my boot and the cart frame, keeping my body behind the plate as much as I can. “Guard #2, lead—if filament shows again, same point, two-shot bursts. If it comes through the gap, you dump the seam until it stops moving.”

I key Dock Control. “B damper’s stuck? Override it—cut power, blow the actuator, I don’t care. Get it shut. Clamp kit better be sprinting.”

Without looking away from the seam, I shove my knife into the foam line like a probe to find the channel edge, then bark at the weld-drone, “Forget pretty—burn a ring on the hatch face around this patch. Give me heat, not a bead.”

*Agent reasoning: The plate won’t hold long and the filament is probing for flesh; I need hands out of reach, more standoff, and decisive violence if it breaches. Buy time until clamps arrive by bracing and creating a kill zone while ordering damper B forced shut.*

#### Turn 205 **[GAME]**

#### Turn 206 **[PLAYER]**

“Tech—back behind the line. Now. I’m not losing you.”

I jam the panel harder into the breach, bracing it with my boot and the cart frame, keeping my torso behind the plate. “Guard #2, lead—filament shows, you stitch the exact point: two-shot bursts. If it pushes through, dump the seam until it stops moving.”

I key Dock Control. “B damper’s stuck? Override it—cut power, blow the actuator, I don’t care. Shut it. And that clamp kit better be running.”

Without taking my eyes off the seam, I stab my knife into the foam line to find the channel edge, then bark at the weld-drone, “Forget pretty—burn a hot ring on the hatch face around this patch. I want heat, not a bead.”

*Agent reasoning: The filament is reaching for exposed hands and the pressure is increasing; I need to remove the tech from danger, force isolation on the stuck damper, and create a crude heat barrier/seal fast even if it’s ugly.*

#### Turn 207 **[GAME]**

The tech doesn’t argue. He lets go immediately and stumbles backward behind the rifle line, cradling his hands tight to his chest like he can’t trust where they’ve been. “I’m clear,” he says, breathing too fast.

You drive the panel in harder and wedge it: boot on the cart frame, shoulder tucked behind steel. The push from the other side meets you—steady pressure—then eases a fraction, like it’s reassessing the new brace.

Your knife goes into the foam at the seam. The blade meets resistance, then slips into a narrow channel that shouldn’t exist in solid AFFF—like a straw-sized void. As you probe sideways, the foam around the knife collapses inward and you feel a faint *vibration* through the handle, a low hum that wasn’t there a second ago.

Guard #2 tracks the seam. The containment lead leans into his sightline. Both are tense but controlled.

Dock Control comes back, voice clipped and strained. “We’re trying. B damper override isn’t taking—manual interlock is refusing. If we cut power it fails *open*, not shut. We can send a runner to the actuator trunk but—” a pause, someone in the background shouting, “—Clamp kit is moving. Thirty seconds.”

You snap at the weld-drone. It swivels, torch brightening. It drops to the hatch face and draws a fast ring of heat around the panel’s edge—no filler, just raw torch.

This time it *does* spark—but wrong. The metal doesn’t glow red; it flashes, then turns pale and crystalline, frosting outward from the heat line instead of receding. The ring you’re trying to burn becomes a white, brittle halo that crackles as it forms.

The pressure behind the panel surges in response—harder now, testing. The cart frame creaks. Your boot slips half an inch, catching again.

Then the filament shows—not where you shot before. It extrudes from the *new* brittle halo, a hairline crack in the frost-ring, and it comes out fast, angling low toward your knife hand like it knows exactly where the gap is.

“CONTACT!” Guard #2 fires two shots into the crack point. The rounds punch through the frosted halo, blasting shards outward. The filament jerks, whips once, and retracts—but not before it brushes the knife blade. The foam around your knife instantly thins, turning watery, and the channel widens.

You now have a compromised seam: the torch-created frost-ring is making the hatch face more brittle, and the thing inside is using those micro-cracks to “route” its filament toward any tool or hand near the gap. The panel is still holding, but the pushes are getting stronger and smarter.

*Simulation triggers: guard_Hub To Discourage Whatever’s Leaning_1_300984, fail_Hell_0_5653a1, watcher_Hell_1_73a8a1, secret_Hell_0_36cb01, secret_Hell_1_4f0844*

#### Turn 208 **[PLAYER]**

“Weld-drone, OFF—back the torch away!” 

I yank my knife out and fling it behind the line without looking. “No tools near the seam—keep your hands off the foam.”

I dig in harder on the panel brace and shout, “Clamp kit here, on my call—two mags ready. Guard #2, lead: filament shows anywhere, you rake the frost-ring, don’t get cute.”

I key Dock Control. “Send that runner to the B actuator trunk NOW. I want it physically shut—jam it, wedge it, whatever. And tell HazMat to bring cold-resistant wraps and a fucking saw if they’ve got it.”

*Agent reasoning: Heat is making it worse and it’s targeting my hands through cracks; I need to stop the weld-drone, keep the panel braced, and switch to mechanical clamps while ordering someone to hit the actuator trunk to shut the damper.*

#### Turn 209 **[GAME]**

The weld-drone chirps an annoyed, descending tone and backs its torch away. The bright cone shutters off, leaving only the hatch’s emergency strips and the pale frost-halo it already laid down—now a brittle ring of micro-cracks around your plate.

Your knife comes free with a wet suction-pop. You fling it behind the line; it skitters across the deck and stops against a boot. Someone yelps and kicks it farther away without thinking.

“No tools near the seam!” you bark, and the nearest Helix techs flatten their hands up and back like they’ve been caught stealing.

You dig in on the brace. The cart frame groans again, but holds.

“Clamp kit!” A welder tech in an arc hood and a station rigger sprint in with a hardcase and a ratcheting band clamp—industrial, meant for hull patching. They drop to a knee just outside your immediate line, waiting for your call, eyes locked on the frost-ring like it might blink.

Guard #2 and the containment lead shift their stance wider. “Copy,” Guard #2 says. He changes his aim point from the original crack to the *entire* frosted halo.

Dock Control crackles back. “Runner dispatched. Two minutes to actuator trunk. HazMat is staging wraps—saw request acknowledged.”

Then the hatch face *ticks*—a sharp, glassy sound. A new hairline crack races along the frost-ring on the lower right.

A filament extrudes from it immediately, thicker than before—more like a black thread than a hair—and it doesn’t reach for hands this time. It lays itself flat against the hatch face and starts sliding along the frost-ring, probing for an edge, searching for a route under your plate.

“FILAMENT!” Guard #2 rakes the halo with a short burst—three, four shots. The frosted ring shatters in little white chips, and the filament snaps back, but you feel the pressure behind the plate *shift* sideways in the same instant, like it learned where you’re weakest.

Your brace jerks. The cart wheels squeal and slide a few centimeters. The panel edge lifts a fraction—just enough for a breath of gray vapor to puff out and instantly rim the gap with fresh frost.

The immediate threat is escalating: the brittle frost-ring is propagating cracks that the filament can use anywhere around the plate, and the force behind the breach is now testing lateral movement to pry up an edge. Your improvised brace is starting to slip.

Night, Harbor City—Saint Brigid Parish on Brine Street, three blocks off Pier Nine. Rain hammers the slate steps and runs in thin streams into the gutter grates. The soup line curls along the brick wall under a flickering streetlamp, and the air tastes of diesel and boiled onions.

You stand under the church’s awning with your collar up, notebook open on your palm so the pages don’t soak through. You count faces the way you count exits: slow, patient, twice. A runner’s habit never leaves; you keep your back to stone, eyes on hands, and you let other people think you’re just another cold body waiting for food.

A man in a dock patrol coat stops at the head of the line and flashes a badge to no one in particular. He’s broad in the shoulders, hair clipped close, and you know his jawline from the morgue corridor the day they told you your brother’s death was an accident. He speaks to the volunteer with the ladle, voice flat. “We’re looking for runaways. No papers. New arrivals. Guild wants names before midnight inspections.” The volunteer hesitates, and the patrolman’s gloved hand rests on the baton at his belt like it’s part of the uniform. Two men loiter across the street under a shuttered fishmonger sign, pretending to smoke while they watch the line and the church door. Then you see the detail that doesn’t fit: a girl near the wall has salt crusted at her cuffs and a yellowing bruise on her inner elbow, like a sedation injection. When she shifts, a torn tag slips from her sleeve and sticks to her wet skin—Meridian Assurance underwriting code, the same format you’ve got penciled beside your brother’s file.

Sister Calwen appears in the doorway and catches your eye. She tilts her head once toward the side entrance that leads down to the crypts, then looks past you at the patrolman as he starts down the line, asking for names.

#### Turn 10 **[PLAYER]**

I drift down the line like I’m just making room, stopping beside the bruised girl. In a low voice: “Don’t look at me—can you walk? Sister’s taking people in the side door.” I angle my body to block the patrolman’s view and, if she moves, I guide her toward Calwen’s side entrance, watching the two “smokers” across the street the whole time.

*Agent reasoning: Patrol is sweeping for names; the girl with Meridian tag is a lead and in immediate danger. Calwen’s signaling a safer route—better to get the girl inside without drawing eyes, and learn what the patrol’s really after.*

#### Turn 11 **[GAME]**

The girl flinches at your voice like it’s a slap, then forces herself to keep her eyes on the soup pot. Up close, the bruise on her inner elbow is the color of old ink, and there’s a faint antiseptic smell under the wet wool of her sleeve.

She answers without turning her head. “I can—” Her jaw tightens. “Not fast.”

You shift in front of her as the patrolman reaches the next cluster of bodies. For half a breath it works: your coat and shoulder take up the patrolman’s line of sight, and the girl uses the moment to step out of the queue like she’s just giving someone room. You put a hand lightly at her elbow—guiding, not dragging—and angle her toward the narrow side passage beside the church.

Across the street, one of the “smokers” stops pretending. He drops his cigarette, grinds it out with a neat heel, and pushes off the wall. The other stays put but turns his head, tracking you. Their attention isn’t casual; it’s practiced, like they’ve been told what to look for.

The patrolman hears the scuff of feet on wet stone and snaps his gaze over the line. His eyes catch the girl’s salt-stained cuffs and the way she favors one leg. “Hey.” He steps toward you, hand leaving the baton and opening like he’s going to take a wrist. “You—stop. Where’s she going?”

Sister Calwen is already at the side entrance, half in shadow, keys in hand. She doesn’t call out. She just holds the door cracked, watching you and the patrolman with a face that doesn’t give him anything to hook.

The girl’s breathing goes shallow. She whispers, almost into your collar, “If he sees my arm—” and she tugs her sleeve down hard enough to wince.

The nearer smoker has crossed the street curb-to-curb and is now ten paces away, coming in at an angle that will cut off the passage if he keeps walking. He doesn’t show a badge. He doesn’t need to. His right hand stays in his coat pocket like it’s holding something heavy.

You’re between the patrolman and the girl, with the side door three steps away—and someone is moving to box you in.

#### Turn 12 **[PLAYER]**

I lift both hands, palms out, and put my body between his reach and the girl. “Easy—she’s about to be sick. Sister Calwen’s got a cot and a bucket inside.” Without looking back, I murmur to the girl, “Now. Through the door—don’t run.” Then I flick my eyes to the approaching smoker and call out, sharp, “You with Dock Patrol? Badge out if you’re stepping in.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m outnumbered and about to get boxed in; my best shot is to stall the patrolman with something official-sounding while getting the girl through the door, and keep my hands visible so nobody has an excuse to hit first.*

#### Turn 13 **[GAME]**

Your hands go up, palms clean and open. The patrolman checks his step—half a pause, not mercy, just calculation. Your body blocks his reach, and for a second his eyes flick past you to the girl’s sleeve like he’s trying to see through cloth.

“About to be sick,” you say. “Sister’s got a cot and a bucket.”

Sister Calwen doesn’t miss the opening. She swings the side door wider just enough to make a gap, and the girl slips through it on your cue—no run, just a stiff, careful walk like she’s afraid her joints will give out. Calwen’s hand closes around the girl’s shoulder and pulls her inside. The door starts to come shut.

The patrolman lunges a step too late and catches the edge of the door with his boot. Wood thuds against leather. “Hold it,” he barks, suddenly loud enough to turn heads in the soup line. “Guild business. I need to—”

Calwen’s voice comes out calm, edged with steel. “Not in my parish you don’t. If you have a warrant, you can show it in the daylight like a civilized man.”

Your shout at the approaching “smoker” lands. “You with Dock Patrol? Badge out if you’re stepping in.”

He stops—two paces short of the passage mouth—and smiles without warmth. He slowly removes his hand from his coat pocket. No badge. Just a small, flat brass token on a chain, flashed and tucked away again too fast for anyone else to catch. Enough to tell you he’s not patrol; he’s something adjacent that doesn’t answer to uniforms.

“Watch your tone,” he says, quiet, and then to the patrolman without looking at him: “She’s not on the list. Let the Sister close her door.”

The patrolman’s face tightens. He keeps his boot in the door a beat longer, then withdraws it like he’s doing Calwen a favor. The door shuts—firm, final. The girl is inside.

Across the street, the second loiterer pushes off the wall and starts walking too—not toward the church, but down the block, taking a line that’ll put him on the far end of the alley that runs behind Saint Brigid. A net, not a rush.

The patrolman points at you with two fingers. “You. I know you. Don’t make this about you tonight.” Then he turns and starts back down the soup line, asking names louder than before, punishing the room for being watched.

The brass-token man stays where he is, eyes on you, measuring. “You just bought her five minutes,” he says. “What’re you spending them on?”

#### Turn 14 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my hands visible and my voice even. “On keeping her alive. What list—whose?”  

Without turning my back, I glance toward the man heading for the alley and then back to the token. “And what are you, exactly, flashing brass in a church line?”

*Agent reasoning: The brass-token man is leverage and a threat; I need to learn who he is and what list he means without giving him my intentions. Also someone is moving to the alley—possible grab team—so I should keep eyes on exits and get Calwen warned.*

#### Turn 15 **[GAME]**

The brass-token man keeps his hands empty and low, like he’s showing you he doesn’t need to hurry. Rain beads on the brim of his hat and runs in clean lines down his coat. Up close you catch the scent of clove smoke—cover for something sharper underneath.

“Whose list?” he repeats, like it’s a joke that isn’t funny. “Meridian’s, dressed up in Guild ink. Names that ‘need correcting.’ People that make policies… complicated.”

When you ask what he is, his eyes flick toward the soup line where the patrolman is still barking for paperwork. Then back to you.

“I’m the part that keeps tonight from turning into a street fight,” he says. “Call me a mediator.”

He shifts his weight—subtle—and you realize he’s positioned so he can see both the side door and the street corner. Not protecting you. Controlling angles.

Behind you, the side door latch clicks again from inside—Sister Calwen throwing an extra bolt. Whatever route she’s using, she’s committing to it.

Down the block, the second man reaches the mouth of the alley behind Saint Brigid. He doesn’t go in right away. He pauses, looks up at the church’s rear windows, then slips into the darkness. A moment later, you hear a soft metallic scrape—like a trash lid being eased, not kicked.

The brass-token man watches your face as if he expects you to run for the alley. “If you go back there,” he says softly, “you’ll meet someone who doesn’t flash anything before he works.”

Across the line, the patrolman’s voice rises again: “No papers? Then step out. Now.” You hear a small protest, a chair leg skittering on wet stone, and the volunteer with the ladle says, “Officer, please—”

The brass-token man takes one step closer—close enough that you can see the faint scar at the corner of his mouth. “You’re Lena Marrow,” he says, not asking. “Meridian already left a card at your office this morning. That means they’re not hunting blind anymore. So: walk away from Saint Brigid tonight, or you’ll force the Sister to choose between her people and you.”

He tilts his head toward the street, where the patrolman is starting to pull someone out of line by the sleeve. “And you’ve got about ten seconds before that turns ugly.”

#### Turn 16 **[PLAYER]**

I lean slightly toward the brass-token man, voice low. “Mediator for who? Give me a name I can write down.”

Then I step toward the soup line, hands still visible. “Officer—she’s with me. I’ll vouch. No need to yank people around in the rain.” I angle my body so I can still see the street corner and call to the volunteer, “Sister Calwen inside? Someone get her—now.”

*Agent reasoning: I don’t want a fight here—too many civilians and it risks drawing attention to the girl. But I can’t just leave; I need info on “Meridian’s list” and I can defuse the patrolman without escalating. I’ll stall the mediator for a name while I intervene verbally with the patrolman, keeping distance from the alley threat.*

#### Turn 18 **[PLAYER]**

I freeze for a beat with my hands still up, scanning the patrolman, the brass-token “mediator,” and the alley mouth behind Saint Brigid. “Alright—what just changed? Who’s in the alley, and who do you answer to?” Then I call toward the side door, “Sister Calwen—are you there? Do you have another exit?”

*Agent reasoning: The scene seems to have advanced without text; I need to re-establish what happened and avoid walking into an unseen consequence. I’ll pause, keep sightlines, and press for immediate info from the nearest threats/anchors: the patrolman, the brass-token man, and Calwen.*

#### Turn 19 **[GAME]**

Your shout for Sister Calwen carries farther than you want. Heads turn. The patrolman’s grip tightens on the sleeve of a thin woman he’s half-dragged out of line; she stumbles, catches herself on a soup table, and the ladle volunteer backs away like she’s been burned.

The brass-token man’s expression changes first—his jaw sets, his eyes go briefly flat.

“What just changed?” he says. “You said her name out loud.”

He doesn’t answer the “who do you answer to” directly. Instead he reaches into his coat slowly, like he’s giving you time to decide whether to panic, and produces a folded card stock—thick, expensive. He holds it up just long enough for you to see a blind-embossed mark: **MERIDIAN ASSURANCE COMBINE**. No name, no title. Just a policy-number string stamped in black at the bottom. Then it’s back in his pocket.

“I answer to the paper,” he says. “Same as everyone else.”

From the alley mouth behind Saint Brigid, you see movement: the man who slipped in is no longer alone. A second figure steps into view behind him—shorter, shoulders squared, cap pulled low. They don’t rush. They position themselves: one near the trash bins, one near the rear wall, both watching the church’s back windows and the side door. One of them has something in his hand that catches the streetlamp for a blink—metal, narrow. A tool, or a blade.

Your call to the side door gets an answer, but not from the door. It comes from a grated basement window set into the church foundation, a few feet from the steps.

Sister Calwen’s voice, tight and controlled: “I’m here. Stop calling my name.”

A pause—then, quieter: “Yes. There’s a way through. But if they hear where, it becomes a trap.”

The patrolman swings his head toward you, eyes narrowing. “Marrow,” he says, like a warning. He lets go of the woman’s sleeve and steps toward you instead, hand hovering near his baton. “You obstructing an inquiry? Because I can make that official.”

The brass-token man shifts half a step—placing himself so he can block the patrolman’s line to you if it comes to it, while still keeping the alley in his peripheral. “This is how it starts,” he murmurs. “Noise. Then bodies.”

You now have two clear threats: the patrolman escalating in front, and two men setting up behind the church—watching for any exit Calwen uses.

*Simulation triggers: fail_Ing Smoker And Call Out_0_0d7fdb, secret_Ing Smoker And Call Out_0_1a00c0*

#### Turn 20 **[PLAYER]**

I take a slow step back, palms still up, and put a little space between me and the patrolman. “Not obstructing—just keeping your line from turning into a riot. I’ll shut up and stand aside.”

Without looking down at the grate, I murmur, “Sister—move her now, but not out back. If you’ve got an interior route, use it. Don’t tell me where.” Then, to the Meridian man, low: “If your people are in that alley, call them off. Or tell me what they’re waiting to catch.”

*Agent reasoning: I’ve escalated things by making noise; I need to de-escalate the patrolman to buy time, while quietly coordinating with Calwen. I also need a better read on the Meridian man and the alley threat without getting boxed in.*

#### Turn 21 **[GAME]**

Your retreat and the promise to stand aside takes a little wind out of the patrolman. His hand drops from the baton to his belt, but he doesn’t relax—he uses the space you give him to reclaim the line.

“Good,” he says. He turns back to the soup queue and points at two people in quick succession. “You. And you. Papers.” His tone says he’s punishing the whole line for your interference.

At the basement grate, there’s a faint scrape—something heavy sliding over stone. Calwen doesn’t answer you with words. She answers with action: the volunteer with the ladle suddenly pivots, blocking the patrolman’s view of the church steps with her body and a sloshing pot, while another volunteer “accidentally” knocks over a crate of stale rolls, drawing eyes and curses. It’s clumsy on purpose. Cover.

In that same beat, the thin woman the patrolman had yanked is guided—not pushed, guided—back into the press of bodies and then sideways toward the church wall. She disappears behind the volunteers’ skirts and the steam off the soup pot. No one sees a door open. No one sees a door close. She’s just… gone from the line.

Behind Saint Brigid, the alley figures react to the sudden bustle. The shorter one raises a hand once—two fingers, quick—and the man by the bins shifts position to get a better angle on the foundation windows. They’re not “your people” in the sense of obeying you, and they don’t look like they’re taking orders from the brass-token man either.

When you press him—call them off or tell you what they’re waiting to catch—his mouth tightens.

“They’re waiting on a mistake,” he says. “A door. A hatch. A face they can swear they recognized.”

He glances past you at the patrolman. “And he’s waiting for you to make one.”

The patrolman snaps, loud enough for the block to hear: “Nobody moves off that line unless I say so.” He steps closer to the church steps, trying to reassert control of the space you just helped Calwen blur.

The brass-token man leans in, voice barely above the rain: “If you keep standing here, you become the reason they search the church. If you leave, you become the reason the alley men follow.”

Concrete threat, now: the patrolman is about to order a search of Saint Brigid’s entrance area, and the two in the alley are poised to intercept anyone exiting through a low route along the foundation.

#### Turn 22 **[PLAYER]**

I give the Meridian man a flat look. “Then I won’t make one.”  

I raise my voice just enough for the patrolman to hear: “Officer—fine. I’m leaving the line.” Then I turn and walk away from Saint Brigid at an unhurried pace, angling toward the corner as if I’m done—while watching reflections in the wet windows for anyone peeling off to follow.  

As I pass the first stack of crates, I “trip” and knock one hard into the street. “Sorry—watch it!” I call, making a small, messy commotion to pull eyes and bodies away from the church steps.

*Agent reasoning: If I stay, I draw a search onto Calwen and the parish; if I bolt toward the alley, I confirm there’s something to catch. Best move is to bleed attention away from the church without looking like I’m coordinating—create a plausible disturbance down the block and drift with it, keeping the alley in view.*

#### Turn 23 **[GAME]**

The patrolman takes your “I’m leaving” as a win he can display. “Good,” he barks, loud. “Keep walking.” He jabs two fingers toward the line again. “Papers out. Now.”

You turn away at an unhurried pace. In the wet glass of a shuttered storefront, you catch three reflections that matter:

1) The patrolman’s head swiveling, tracking you until you’re two storefronts away.  
2) The brass-token Meridian man not following—staying planted near the church steps, watching the alley mouth like he’s measuring timing.  
3) A fourth reflection that wasn’t there before: a man peeling off from the edge of the soup line, hat brim low, moving after you with the practiced casual of someone trying not to look like he’s moving after you.

Your “trip” sends a crate corner-first into the street with a hollow crack. Produce rolls out, wet paper wrapping tearing. People jump back; one dockhand curses and grabs his shin. A wagon driver yanks his reins, shouting as a wheel splashes through a puddle and clips the crate—wood splinters snap and skid.

The commotion does what you want—half the line’s attention snaps away from the church steps. Two volunteers surge forward, scolding and shooing bodies back from the street. For a moment, the church entrance area is less watched.

But it also gives the patrolman an excuse to move.

“Clear that!” he snaps, and steps off his post toward the street mess—close enough now that he can see along the church wall and the steps again. He gestures to a second uniform you hadn’t clocked at first—standing under the eave across the way—who starts angling toward the church side door with a hand on his coat like he’s ready to push through if ordered.

Behind you, the man who peeled off keeps coming. In the window reflection, he doesn’t hurry; he uses the same pauses you do—stops when you stop, resumes when you resume. When you glance at a different pane of glass, you see a second tail join: someone stepping out of the alley mouth behind Saint Brigid and taking the cross-street to shadow you from the far side.

Threat is now clear and immediate: you have **two separate followers** triangulating you as you leave—one from the soup line, one from the alley—while the patrol presence at Saint Brigid shifts toward the side door, increasing the risk of a forced entry/search.

#### Turn 24 **[PLAYER]**

I keep walking like I don’t notice, then cut into a crowded, well-lit corner shop as if I’m just getting out of the rain; once inside, I drift to the back and watch the door and front window reflections to confirm who follows.  

If one or both come in, I step to the counter and say to the clerk, loud and steady, “I’m being followed—if I ask, will you call for a patrol?” Then I slip out the shop’s back exit (if it has one) and double back along the next building line to see if I can spot the alley tail crossing to reacquire me.

*Agent reasoning: Two tails means I can’t lead them back to Calwen or my office. I need to confirm the tails, shake at least one, and if I can’t, steer them somewhere controlled with witnesses and multiple exits.*

#### Turn 25 **[GAME]**

You cut into a corner shop with a bright sodium sign—**KELP & CANDLE**—half grocery, half household junk. The bell over the door gives you away with a cheerful chime that doesn’t fit the night. Inside it’s crowded: wet coats, cigarette breath, a couple of dockhands buying cheap lamp oil and bread.

You drift toward the back beside stacked tins and mop buckets, using the front window as a mirror.

The **first tail** (from the soup line) reaches the door in under ten seconds. He pauses outside like he’s reading the handbills taped to the glass, then steps in, shakes rain off his sleeves, and pretends to browse the dry goods—eyes flicking to the back aisles in quick, controlled checks.

The **second tail** (from the alley) doesn’t enter. In the window reflection you catch him crossing the street slowly, stopping under the awning of the pawnshop opposite, posture angled so he can see the shop door without looking like he’s watching it.

When the first tail drifts closer—close enough you can smell wet wool—you move to the counter.

The clerk is a narrow man with ink-stained fingers and a tired apron. You say, loud and steady, “I’m being followed—if I ask, will you call for a patrol?”

The clerk’s eyes jump to the tail, then to the street, then back to you. He doesn’t refuse, but he doesn’t commit either. “Patrol’s already thick tonight,” he says carefully, voice raised to match yours. “You cause trouble in my shop, they’ll treat it like my trouble.”

The tail at the dry goods shelf turns a tin over, reading the label like it’s fascinating. He doesn’t leave.

You scan for a back exit. There is one—**a curtained door marked “STOCK”** behind the counter. But as you angle your head, you see the detail that kills the easy escape: a **chain looped through the back door’s push bar**, padlocked from the inside. The clerk follows your glance and says, flat: “Back’s not for customers.”

Outside, through the front glass, the alley-tail under the pawnshop awning shifts—then raises two fingers briefly to someone out of frame, like a signal.

A moment later, the shop bell chimes again. A **second man** steps in—different from the first tail, heavier build, hands bare despite the cold. He doesn’t browse. He just stands by the door, blocking the easiest exit without making it look like he’s blocking it.

Threat, plain: you’re now **contained in the shop**—one watcher inside “shopping,” one inside on the door, and at least one set of eyes outside coordinating. If you force the back, it becomes a scene; if you leave the front, you step into their hands.

#### Turn 26 **[PLAYER]**

I turn to the clerk and speak like I’m making a normal purchase, loud enough for the whole front to hear. “Two lamp oils and a pack of matches—on credit if you can. And write the names down: first man in the wool coat by the tins, second man by your door. If anything happens to me, you tell the patrol they followed me in.”

Then I raise my chin toward the door-blocker. “Either buy something or stop standing like a bouncer—you're scaring off business.” I let the silence hang, eyes flicking to the customers. “Anyone here know Officer Harlan? He was just two streets over harassing a soup line—he’ll love this.”

I stay planted at the counter, one hand on my notebook inside my coat, the other flat on the wood—no sudden moves—watching which one reaches first.

*Agent reasoning: I’m boxed in; I need witnesses and leverage, not a fight. Best move is to make it publicly expensive for them to grab me, and create a reason for a patrolman to walk in without me “calling for help.”*

#### Turn 27 **[GAME]**

Your “purchase” voice carries. Heads turn. A dockhand with a bandaged knuckle pauses mid-coin-count. A woman with a basket of onions stops and looks from you to the men like she’s doing arithmetic.

The clerk swallows, then reaches under the counter and sets down two squat tins of lamp oil and a paper-wrapped match pack—more to have his hands doing something than to help you. He doesn’t say “credit.” He says, carefully, “That’ll be six bits.”

When you tell him to write the names down, he doesn’t pick up a pen. Instead, he lifts his chin toward a small slate behind him—inventory marks—and says, just as loud, “I don’t write down customers. I sell goods.” His eyes flick once to the padlock chain on the stock door, then back to you: warning without words.

Your call-out lands.

The wool-coat man by the tins stops pretending. He sets the tin down with deliberate care and walks closer, slow, palms visible. “No one’s hurting you,” he says, voice pitched to sound reasonable to bystanders. “You’re making a scene.”

The door-blocker doesn’t answer you at all. He shifts his stance—still “just standing”—but his shoulder now covers the door handle fully. He glances outside through the glass, then back in.

“Officer Harlan?” a customer near the bread rack says, uncertain. “I know him.” It’s not helpful; it’s fear dressed up as civic pride.

And then the outside coordination becomes action: through the front window you see a uniform approaching at a brisk walk from the pawnshop side—cap low, rain shining on his sleeves. Not Harlan. Another patrolman. He slows as he nears the shop, assessing the faces inside.

The wool-coat man closes to within arm’s reach of the counter, still with open hands. “Come on,” he says softly, for you now, not the room. “Let’s take this outside. You don’t want them asking you questions in here.”

The threat is immediate and specific: you’ve drawn patrol attention, but it’s not automatically protection—**the arriving officer can just as easily decide you’re the disturbance**, and the two men are positioning to steer you out the front door the moment he enters, where the outside watcher can join in.

No one has grabbed you yet. They’re waiting for the uniform to tip the balance.

I square my shoulders toward the door and call out to the approaching patrolman before he steps in. “Officer—this man’s blocking the exit and that one’s been tailing me. I’m not leaving with either of them. I’d like your name and badge number, and I want you to ask them for theirs.”

I slide six bits onto the counter without taking my eyes off the door-blocker. “I’m a paying customer, and I’m staying right here.”

Then, to the wool-coat man, calm but hard: “Step back. If you touch me, I scream, and everyone in here becomes a witness.”

*Agent reasoning: Patrol could treat me as the problem; I need to control the narrative before the men steer me outside. Stay in public view, keep hands visible, and force the officer to address the men’s behavior too.*

I keep my palms visible on the counter and call to the patrolman at the door, “Officer—before you step in, I need your name and badge number. These two have been tailing me and one’s blocking the exit. I’m not leaving with them.”  

I nod once at the clerk. “If anything happens, you saw who was here—please tell the patrol.”  

Then I look the door-blocker dead on. “Move off the handle. Now.”

*Agent reasoning: No new scene text came through, so I’ll hold my ground and try to anchor the situation to the arriving patrolman while keeping my hands visible and forcing names/badge numbers—low-risk, high-information.*

#### Turn 31 **[GAME]**

The patrolman stops with one boot on the shop’s threshold, rain dripping off his cap brim onto the welcome mat. He doesn’t come in yet. His eyes rake the room: you at the counter, the heavy man planted by the door, the wool-coat man too close to you, the customers frozen mid-purchase.

“Name’s **Officer Rusk**,” he says, not raising his voice. He taps the number on his badge with two fingers like it ought to be enough. “Now lower the temperature.”

He points with his chin at the door-blocker. “You. Step aside.”

The heavy man doesn’t argue—but he also doesn’t really comply. He slides half a step so the handle is visible again, while keeping his body between you and the street. It’s a concession that still functions like a trap.

Wool-coat lifts his hands higher, performing innocence for the room. “Officer, she’s wound up. We’re just trying to talk—”

Rusk cuts him off without looking at him. “Did I ask you to talk?”

Your nod to the clerk draws a reaction: the clerk finally reaches for a stub of pencil, hesitates, then scratches something on the slate behind him—no names, just marks like he’s recording a sale. His eyes won’t meet yours.

Rusk steps fully inside and the bell rings. That sound breaks the spell—one customer backs away toward the bread rack; another slips out the side of the aisle like he doesn’t want to be remembered.

Rusk addresses you directly, flat and procedural. “You’re claiming you’re being followed. Do you have a name? A reason? Or do you just want me to throw two men out of a shop because you don’t like their faces?”

As he speaks, the heavy man by the door takes advantage of the officer’s body now between you and the street: he reaches behind him and turns the lock bolt on the door with a quiet *click*. You see it happen. The front exit is now **locked from the inside**.

Rusk doesn’t react to the click—either he didn’t hear it, or he’s choosing not to.

The immediate threat is clear: you’re now in a locked room with two men who’ve contained you, and the only uniform present is treating this like *your* complaint to prove, not their behavior to stop.

#### Turn 32 **[PLAYER]**

I jerk my chin at the door, eyes on Rusk. “Officer Rusk—he just locked the front door. That’s unlawful restraint. Open it, now.”

I slide a half-step sideways to keep the counter between me and wool-coat, palms still visible. To the room: “Did you all hear that click? Anyone see him turn the bolt?”

Then, to Rusk, steady: “I don’t need a reason to walk out of a shop. I’m leaving. If they stop me, you’ll have your reason.”

*Agent reasoning: Rusk may be compromised or just lazy; I need him focused on the locked door as an objective fact, not my story. Create witnesses, keep distance, and force Rusk to act on the unlawful confinement.*

#### Turn 33 **[GAME]**

Rusk’s eyes flick to the door. For the first time his expression tightens—annoyance, not alarm.

“Unlock it,” he says, voice low.

The heavy man doesn’t move. He keeps his shoulder angled toward you, chin down. “Door’s been sticking all week,” he says, like it’s a joke that’s supposed to land.

Rusk takes one step toward him. “Now.”

Wool-coat shifts too—just a half-step, trying to keep himself between you and Rusk’s line of sight. “Officer, she’s—”

Rusk snaps his gaze to wool-coat. “Back. Against the shelves.”

Wool-coat obeys, but slow, eyes never leaving you. He’s measuring distance.

You ask the room about the click. A thin man near the bread rack gives a quick, frightened nod—yes, he heard it—but he doesn’t speak. The woman with the onions whispers, “I heard,” then immediately looks down like she’s afraid her own voice will be held against her. No one offers a full statement. They’re witnesses in the way a city is: present, careful, and already rehearsing denial.

Rusk closes on the heavy man and reaches for the bolt himself.

That’s when the heavy man finally moves—fast. He catches Rusk’s wrist with one hand and shoves him back a step. Not a punch. A control move. The kind that says he’s done it before.

Rusk’s hand goes to his baton.

And the heavy man says, clear as day, loud enough for the shop: “Don’t. Guild business.”

The word lands like a weight. Rusk freezes for half a beat—long enough to tell you it means something.

In that half beat, wool-coat takes his chance. He pushes off the shelves and comes around the end of the counter, closing the gap toward you, hands still up but coming in like he means to steer you—hard—away from the clerk and toward the locked door.

Rusk turns sharply, baton half-drawn, caught between the “Guild business” in front of him and you about to be grabbed.

Concrete threat: **wool-coat is within arm’s reach and moving to put hands on you; the door is locked; Rusk is hesitating under pressure from the heavy man’s Guild claim.**

#### Turn 34 **[PLAYER]**

I snatch the nearest lamp oil tin off the counter and hold it up between us like a weight, backing tight behind the counter edge. “Touch me and I smash this—on you, on the floor, on the lanterns. Whole shop goes up.”

I raise my voice to the room and Rusk. “Officer Rusk, I’m being detained in a locked shop. I want that door opened and I want these men searched—now.”

To wool-coat, low and hard: “One more step and you’re wearing oil.”

*Agent reasoning: If wool-coat gets hands on me, I’m done. I need space and leverage without escalating to a fight I can’t win. Creating a loud, unmistakable assault and forcing Rusk to act is my best shot, plus using the counter as a barrier and an improvised weapon if needed.*

#### Turn 35 **[GAME]**

Your fingers clamp around a squat tin of lamp oil on the counter—cold metal, greasy label—and you bring it up fast like a fist with weight. Wool-coat checks himself mid-step. His hands stay up, but his eyes flick to the shop’s hanging lantern and the open flame behind the counter.

The clerk goes pale. “Don’t—” he starts, then swallows the rest. He slides his hands off the counter edge like he’s afraid you’ll splash him by accident.

“Everybody back from the lights,” the onion woman blurts, finally finding a voice. She tugs a kid by the sleeve away from the nearest lantern hook.

Officer Rusk’s baton comes fully free with a dry rasp. He points it, not at you—at wool-coat. “Stop right there.”

The heavy man by the door lifts both palms, slow, showing he’s not reaching for anything. “No one’s touching her,” he says, but his eyes are on the oil tin now, calculating.

Wool-coat lowers his voice, trying to sound reasonable while staying out of reach. “You smash that, you’ll burn alive in here with us.”

Rusk snaps, louder now, for the room to hear: “Unlock. The. Door.”

The heavy man hesitates—long enough to tell you he’s deciding whether Rusk is worth defying in public—then reaches back and slides the bolt open with a sharp *clack*. The front door is now **unlocked**.

Rusk immediately steps into the lane between you and wool-coat, baton out, and barks to the clerk without looking away from the two men: “You—go get another patrolman. Now. Run.”

The clerk doesn’t argue. He bolts for the back room curtain.

Wool-coat doesn’t advance, but he does angle his body toward the open doorway like he’s ready to slip out the second Rusk commits to either of them. The heavy man stays by the door, not blocking it anymore—just *occupying* it.

Threat is still live and specific: **the door is open, but both men are positioned to either rush you if you move past them or flee before backup arrives; Rusk is alone and has just escalated by calling for another unit.**

#### Turn 36 **[PLAYER]**

Keeping the oil tin raised, I edge sideways behind Rusk’s shoulder toward the open door. “Rusk—stay between me and them. I’m stepping out, and I’m not running.”

I cut my eyes to wool-coat. “Name. Now. Or I remember your face and you get to wonder when I say it to the wrong person.”

Then to the heavy man, voice sharp: “And you—‘Guild business’ isn’t a badge. Show me what you think protects you.”

*Agent reasoning: The door’s open but they’re poised to either grab me or vanish; I want out without turning my back, and I want something identifiable—names, details—before they bolt. I’ll use Rusk as a buffer and the oil tin as leverage, and try to force at least one to give a name or show a mark while I exit.*

#### Turn 38 **[PLAYER]**

Keeping the oil tin up, I sidestep toward the doorway, staying tight behind Rusk’s shoulder. “Officer Rusk—escort me outside. If they follow, you’ll see it.”

Without taking my eyes off the heavy man, I say, “You said ‘Guild business.’ Show a mark, a writ—something. Otherwise step away from the door.”

*Agent reasoning: The door’s finally open, but these two are still positioned to either grab me or bolt. I want out into the street without turning my back, and I want Rusk committing—either he escorts me or he’s compromised. Pressing for names/credentials might rattle them, but leaving safely comes first.*

#### Turn 39 **[GAME]**

Rusk shifts immediately, shoulder turning to give you a lane while keeping his baton and body between you and wool-coat. “Move,” he says, clipped. “Slow.”

You sidestep with the oil tin raised. The metal edge scrapes the counter as you clear it, and the lantern flame behind the clerk’s station wobbles from the draft of the now-open door.

Heavy man doesn’t step aside—but he does pivot, giving just enough space that you can pass without brushing him. It’s deliberate: close enough to touch, not close enough to be accused of grabbing.

You demand a mark or writ.

He answers by pulling his coat lapel open with two fingers and flashing what looks like a brass-and-enamel pin—anchor-and-gear motif—on the inside seam. Not a patrol badge. More like a membership mark. He keeps it visible for only a second.

“Harbor Authority,” he says. “Inspection authority. You don’t get to—”

Rusk cuts him off. “You’re not on my roster.” He jabs the baton toward the man’s chest without touching him. “And you’re not locking doors with civilians inside.”

Wool-coat uses the argument as cover: he slides sideways toward the doorway, trying to time it so he’s moving when Rusk’s eyes are on the heavy man. His hands stay up, but his feet are quick.

Rusk sees it late—half a heartbeat—and snaps, “Stay where you are!”

You and Rusk make it to the threshold. Rain air rushes in, cold and wet. Outside, the street is empty in the immediate splash of lamplight—except for a shape across the way under the awning: a man pretending to read a posted notice, head angled just enough to watch the door.

Behind you, the heavy man shifts his weight toward the jamb like he might “accidentally” close it again if Rusk steps fully out.

Concrete threat: **you can exit now, but if Rusk steps outside with you, the heavy man is positioned to swing the door shut and isolate you or Rusk; wool-coat is trying to slip out in the same moment; there’s at least one watcher across the street already set on the exit.**

#### Turn 40 **[PLAYER]**

I stop on the threshold and don’t step into the rain yet. “Rusk—keep one foot in the door. Don’t let him close it.”

I lift the oil tin toward the watcher across the street, just enough to signal I’ve seen him. “You under the awning—stay right there. Officer’s watching.”

Then, to Rusk in a low voice: “Call his bluff. Ask for his Harbor Authority writ and name—out loud. And don’t let wool-coat slip past.”

*Agent reasoning: If I step out alone, I’m exposed to the watcher; if Rusk steps out, they can slam the door and split us. I need the door controlled and witnesses locked in place while we assess outside.*

#### Turn 41 **[GAME]**

Rusk plants his boot hard against the threshold, toe hooked under the door edge so it can’t swing shut without taking his foot with it. “Try it,” he tells the heavy man, quiet but flat.

You angle the oil tin at the watcher under the awning.

The watcher doesn’t freeze. He folds the paper like he’s finished reading it, tucks it into his coat, and takes two unhurried steps away from the lamplight—toward the darker stretch between storefronts. Not running. Repositioning. His right hand stays in his pocket.

Inside, Rusk raises his voice so the whole shop hears. “Harbor Authority—name and writ. Out loud. Now.”

The heavy man’s jaw tightens. He pats his inner breast pocket with two fingers, like he’s reminding himself it’s there, but he doesn’t produce anything. “You don’t have jurisdiction—”

Rusk interrupts, louder. “Name.”

Wool-coat chooses that moment to move. He dips his shoulder and tries to slide past the heavy man and the jamb—aiming for the crack between Rusk’s planted foot and the doorframe.

Rusk reacts fast this time: baton swings down, not a strike—an abrupt block across the gap. Wood thunks. Wool-coat jerks back, but his sleeve catches the baton’s tip for an instant, tugging fabric.

Wool-coat’s hands drop from “surrender” to something else—fingers flexing like he’s about to shove through anyway.

The heavy man makes his play: he leans into Rusk’s planted leg, trying to force the door inward against the boot and pinch Rusk off balance. It’s not subtle. It’s a controlled crush.

Outside, the watcher under the awning turns his head toward the commotion and lifts his pocketed hand slightly—still concealed—like he’s waiting for a clean line or a signal.

**Immediate threat, clear:** the heavy man is trying to trap/torque Rusk’s leg in the door and knock him down; wool-coat is poised to rush the gap; the watcher outside is repositioning with a hidden hand in his pocket, likely armed or signaling.

#### Turn 42 **[PLAYER]**

I slam the oil tin down hard onto the heavy man’s forearm/hand where he’s leaning into the door, using it like a club, then immediately hook my free hand into Rusk’s belt/coat and yank him backward off the threshold. 

As we move, I shout out into the street, “HELP—OFFICER UNDER ATTACK! Man outside with his hand in his pocket!” 

I back us into the shop’s open space, oil tin still up, and snap at Rusk: “Don’t let them split you from the door—call for that second patrolman again, loud.”

*Agent reasoning: Rusk’s about to get dropped and pinned in the doorway; if that happens, I’m trapped between three men. I need to break their leverage without starting a fire, and get us out into open space while calling attention to the watcher.*

#### Turn 43 **[GAME]**

The oil tin comes down with a dull, ugly clang against the heavy man’s forearm where he’s braced into the jamb. Metal on bone. He grunts—more surprise than pain at first—then his hand spasms and slips off the door edge. The pressure against Rusk’s boot eases for a breath.

You seize Rusk by the belt/coat seam and haul.

Rusk stumbles backward into the shop, boot scraping free of the threshold just as the heavy man surges again. The door swings inward half a foot, then rebounds on its hinge—still open, but now uncontrolled.

Your shout knifes out into the rain: “HELP—OFFICER UNDER ATTACK! Man outside—hand in his pocket!”

Across the street, the watcher’s head snaps up. He doesn’t charge. He backs into the dark between storefronts and **pulls his hand free**—not a gun, but a small dark object that disappears into his other palm. A signal piece, or something he can ditch fast. He’s gone from view in two steps.

Inside, the clerk yelps and ducks behind the counter, knocking over a stack of receipts. Glass rattles.

Wool-coat takes the opening. He darts through the doorway into the rain, shoulder low, moving fast now that he’s committed. You catch a glimpse of his face in the streetlamp flare—thin mouth, eyes fixed ahead—and then he’s outside, angling hard left down the sidewalk.

The heavy man, forearm reddening where you struck him, doesn’t pursue immediately. Instead he swings his body into the doorway, blocking it again—this time from the inside—with his good arm spread against the frame like a brace. He’s breathing heavier, jaw set.

Rusk recovers his stance in the shop’s open space, baton up. He barks, loud enough to carry: “SECOND UNIT—NOW! Corner of—” He rattles off the street name like he’s spitting nails.

The heavy man answers Rusk directly, voice low and threatening: “You just made this a problem you can’t file.”

**Threat, concrete:** wool-coat has escaped into the street; the outside watcher has repositioned out of sight after signaling/handling a small object; the heavy man is now physically holding the doorway from inside, keeping you penned while his people move outside.

#### Turn 44 **[PLAYER]**

I keep the oil tin up and back away from the doorway, putting a counter and a lantern’s radius between me and the heavy man. “Clerk—back door. Now. Is there a back exit or not?”

To Rusk, low: “Don’t let him bait you. Get his name and that pin—describe it for the report, out loud.” Then louder to the heavy man: “Step away from the door and show your writ. Full name. If you’re ‘Harbor Authority,’ you won’t mind it being said in front of witnesses.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re getting boxed in—door blocked from inside, at least two outside. I need to keep distance, create leverage, and get names/evidence while Rusk holds authority. Fire is a last resort but the oil gives me a deterrent; we should also use a back exit if there is one.*

#### Turn 45 **[GAME]**

You backpedal with the oil tin up, keeping the counter between you and the doorway. The lantern throws a trembling circle of light across the floorboards; in it, the heavy man’s shadow stretches long and warped, one arm still braced on the frame.

The clerk pops up just enough to answer, eyes wide. “Back—” He swallows. “No back door. Just the delivery hatch to the alley, but it’s— it’s chained from outside.” He points with a shaking finger toward a metal hatch behind the counter, half-hidden by stacked crates.

Rusk takes your cue. He doesn’t advance. He squares his shoulders and raises his voice like he’s reading into a recorder. “Subject presenting as Harbor Authority. Anchor-and-gear pin, brass with enamel—worn inside coat seam. Refuses to produce writ. Refuses name.”

The heavy man’s mouth twitches—almost a smile, but it doesn’t reach his eyes. “Write whatever bedtime story you like, officer.”

Lena, when you demand the writ and name, he finally shifts—but not back. He slides his bracing arm away from the frame and turns his body sideways, freeing one hand to reach into his coat.

For a second it looks like compliance.

Then he produces a folded paper—too fast, too casual—and holds it up just inside the doorway where the rainlight can’t hit it clean. No seal visible at this distance. No clear letterhead. He doesn’t hand it over.

“Writ,” he says. “Satisfied?”

Rusk steps half a pace to get an angle. The heavy man snaps the paper back before Rusk can read more than a line. “You don’t touch it.”

At the same time, from outside in the rain, you hear quick footfalls and a low call—two voices, not shouted, coordinating. Not patrol cadence. Dockside.

The heavy man glances past you toward the chained hatch behind the counter, like he’s checking that route is still shut. Then he lifts his chin at Rusk. “Your second unit won’t come. Not tonight.”

**Threat, clear:** there are at least two additional men closing outside; the alley hatch is chained from the outside; the heavy man is controlling the doorway and flashing a possibly fake writ without letting it be examined—stalling while help arrives for him, not you.

#### Turn 46 **[PLAYER]**

I nod toward the hatch and whisper to the clerk, “Get me something heavy—crowbar, hammer, anything—and put that lantern near the hatch. Quiet.”

To Rusk, low and fast: “They’ve got the alley. Don’t chase—hold center and keep your whistle ready. On my count, we make noise and push the door wide, not out—just wide enough to see who’s out there.”

I raise my voice at the heavy man, buying seconds: “Read it. Out loud. Full text—date, issuing office, and your full name. If it’s real, you won’t be afraid of witnesses.”

Then I call toward the hatch, loud enough to carry: “Whoever’s in the alley—chain comes off now, or when we open this door the whole street hears what you’re doing to an officer.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re being boxed in and the “writ” is a stall while more men arrive. We need information, leverage, and an exit—preferably without getting Rusk isolated. The hatch being chained from outside suggests someone’s already in the alley; we should confirm and force noise/attention while preparing a break-out.*

#### Turn 47 **[GAME]**

The clerk nods hard, lips pressed white, and drops out of sight behind the counter. You hear frantic rummaging—wood scraping, a drawer yanked open and shut too fast. He slides the lantern off its hook and sets it on the floor near the hatch, turning the wick down until it’s a low, steady glow. Then he comes up with a short iron pry bar—more nail-puller than crowbar—but heavy enough to crack knuckles. He holds it out handle-first, shaking.

Rusk leans in to answer you—and at the word **“whistle”** his hand pats his coat pocket on reflex.

The heavy man sees it too.

He snaps, “Don’t,” and his free hand drops to his own waistband under the coat.

Your demand—“Read it out loud”—lands. The heavy man’s eyes flick to the clerk, to the hatch, to the shop windows. He doesn’t read. He folds the paper tighter, like it was never meant to be heard. “You want words,” he says, “here’s one: *leave*.”

Then your call toward the alley: “Chain comes off now—”

From behind the hatch, iron answers iron: the chain gives a short, testing rattle, like someone tugged it once and stopped. A voice—male, close, amused—comes through the seams. “Wrong door, sweetheart.”

Outside the front, the two quiet voices you heard earlier get closer—boots on wet stone, then a pause right beyond the threshold as if they’re taking positions out of your lantern line.

The heavy man shifts his stance and **kicks the door inward**—not to close it, but to swing it wider and clear his own space. Rain blows in. Streetlamp light spills across the entry.

You get a clean slice of what’s there: two Harbor “safety men” in oilskins step out from the building’s edge, batons low and a wrapped hook-knife hanging from one wrist. They don’t rush; they fan slightly to either side of the doorway, cutting angles.

“Officer,” one of them calls, voice polite as paperwork, “you’re done here.”

**Threat, immediate:** three men at the front (heavy man inside controlling the threshold; two armed “safety men” outside), and at least one man in the alley holding the hatch chain. Your exits are effectively covered; the shop is now your only space.

And Rusk’s whistle—if it comes out—will carry.

#### Turn 48 **[PLAYER]**

I take the pry bar from the clerk and back up to keep the counter between us and the doorway, bar up and ready but not swinging yet. “Rusk—WHISTLE. Now!”  

Then I raise my voice toward the street: “These men are impersonating Harbor Authority and threatening an officer—someone go get patrol, right now!”  

To the heavy man, steady: “Nobody touches that officer. You want us to ‘leave,’ you step back and let us walk out together—slow—hands where I can see them.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re boxed in and outnumbered; the safest leverage is visibility and noise. I want Rusk to signal for help while I keep distance, put obstacles between us and them, and avoid getting isolated near the hatch or the door.*

#### Turn 49 **[GAME]**

The pry bar’s cold weight settles into your hand. You back until the counter’s corner is between you and the doorway, giving yourself a hard edge and a narrow lane.

Rusk doesn’t hesitate. He brings the whistle up and **blasts** it—sharp, piercing, the kind of sound that makes teeth itch.

Outside, the two oilskin men flinch and then move anyway. One steps to the doorframe and **hooks a gloved hand around the edge**, steadying it; the other shifts out into the street, head turning, scanning for who’s watching.

Your shout—“Impersonating Harbor Authority—get patrol!”—carries into the rain.

You get an answer, but not the one you want: a window across the street snaps open a few inches, a face appears for half a second, then the sash drops closed like it burned them. A couple under an awning pretends they didn’t hear, shoulders hunched, walking faster. People are nearby, but nobody wants to be a witness in this neighborhood.

The heavy man’s eyes harden at the whistle. He doesn’t step back. He **steps in**, one pace over the threshold line, keeping his body between Rusk and the oilskins like he’s corralling you. His hand comes up, palm out—not surrender, command.

“Officer’s making a disturbance,” he calls to the street, loud enough to overwrite your narrative. “We’re escorting him out.”

Then, quieter to his men but clear in the lantern spill: “Take the whistle.”

One oilskin man lunges for Rusk—not a tackle, a practiced snatch—arm shooting in to grab Rusk’s coat front and the hand with the whistle. Rusk jerks back, baton half-raised, but he’s off-balance from the counter and the sudden reach.

At the same time, from the alley hatch behind you: **the chain rattles again**, longer this time, and you hear metal scrape like someone is testing the padlock with a tool. Whoever’s back there is working the chain—either to open it or to make sure it stays shut.

**Threat, immediate and specific:** an oilskin “safety man” is actively trying to seize Rusk’s whistle and control him; the heavy man is advancing to herd you; someone in the alley is manipulating the chained hatch, potentially changing your only alternate exit in seconds.

#### Turn 50 **[PLAYER]**

I step in and slam the pry bar down onto the oilskin man’s forearm/wrist as he grabs for Rusk—hard enough to make him let go—then hook my other hand into Rusk’s sleeve and yank him back behind the counter with me. 

“Rusk, keep that whistle in your mouth and back up—don’t let them take your hands,” I hiss. Then louder, to the doorway: “Touch him again and I start breaking fingers—back out of this shop!” 

I glance over my shoulder at the hatch and call to the alley, sharp: “Clerk—get me whatever cuts chain. Now. And you out there—show your face or you’re getting a lantern full of oil.”

*Agent reasoning: Rusk losing the whistle and getting grabbed is the fastest way we get controlled; I need to break that grab without escalating to lethal force. Also the hatch being worked means our rear could open—or get sealed—so I should keep it in sight and use the counter as cover while we reposition.*

#### Turn 51 **[GAME]**

You step in fast and bring the pry bar down.

It lands with a wet, ugly *thunk* on the oilskin man’s forearm right as his fingers close on Rusk’s coat. He yelps and his grip pops open. The whistle shrieks again—continuous, panicked, but still sounding.

The oilskin man staggers back a half-step, clutching his arm. “Bitch—!” he spits, pain turning his voice thin. His baton comes up, not swinging yet, but ready.

You hook Rusk by the sleeve and haul him back behind the counter. He stumbles, catches himself on the wood, and keeps the whistle between his teeth like you told him—eyes watering, breathing hard through his nose.

Your warning—breaking fingers—gets a reaction: the heavy man stops advancing. Not because he’s scared of the threat, but because he’s calculating.

He points at you with the folded “writ” like it’s a badge. “Assaulting a safety inspector. Officer inciting. Witnesses heard it.” He says it loudly, for the street.

Then he gives a small, sharp gesture with two fingers.

The uninjured oilskin man moves to the doorframe and **yanks the shop door wider**, clearing space. The injured one squares up, baton up, and starts to come in—angling for the narrow opening at the end of the counter, the way you’d come around to reach the register.

Behind you, the hatch chain gives a final rattle—then a different sound: **metal biting metal**, like bolt cutters closing. The padlock doesn’t snap, but it *screams* under pressure. Whoever’s in the alley is trying to force it.

The clerk, pale and sweating, scrabbles under the counter. “I— I got a cleaver!” he blurts, producing a butcher’s cleaver from a drawer like it’s a prayer. Not chain-cutters. Not a file. Just kitchen steel.

And the heavy man’s hand finally comes out from under his coat holding something dark and compact—**a pistol**, low at his thigh, not yet raised. His voice drops, meant only for you and Rusk.

“Whistle stops,” he says. “Or the officer does.”

**Threats now:** baton-man pushing into the shop from the counter end; alley-man actively trying to cut the hatch lock; heavy man has a gun and is prepared to use it to end the whistle.

#### Turn 52 **[PLAYER]**

“Rusk—DOWN. Behind the counter, now!” I shove him low and duck with him, keeping the counter between us and that pistol.

To the clerk, urgent and low: “Kill the lantern—now. And get behind me.”

I yank the oil tin up and hurl it hard toward the doorway at chest height—not to hit, to make them flinch and block their view—then, from cover, I snap, “You fire in here and the whole block hears it—patrol’s already coming. Back off!”

*Agent reasoning: Gun changes the math—keeping the whistle going risks Rusk getting shot. We need cover, break their line of sight, and create a chance to escape through the hatch if it opens. I’ll force Rusk down, use the counter as hard cover, and use noise/light to disrupt their push without giving the gunman a clean shot.*

#### Turn 53 **[GAME]**

Rusk drops when you shove him—hard. His shoulder knocks the counter leg and he goes down behind the wood with a grunt, whistle still in his mouth. The sound turns muffled but doesn’t stop; it becomes a steady, ugly bleat under the counter like an alarm trapped in a box.

The clerk fumbles for the lantern. His fingers are slick with sweat; he gets the chimney, twists the wick down too far, and the flame gutters—then dies. The shop goes dim fast, lit only by rain-blue spill from the doorway and a thin band of streetlamp. The counter becomes real cover now, but so does every shadow.

You snatch the oil tin and throw.

It sails chest-high and the uninjured oilskin man jerks back on instinct, forearms up. The heavy man flinches too—his pistol hand dips as he turns his shoulder. The tin clips the doorframe with a ringing *clang* and tumbles into the threshold area, dented, skittering in a slick half-circle on wet boards.

The baton-man who’d started to come around the counter checks his step to avoid it—just a heartbeat of hesitation, but it’s there.

Then the heavy man recovers. He doesn’t fire blind. He **steps sideways out of the doorway line** to get an angle around the counter, keeping most of his body behind the doorframe while the pistol comes up to a low-ready, pointed toward where your head would be if you popped up.

“Patrol?” he says, voice flat. “Then you’ve got about ten seconds to decide how brave you are.”

Outside, one of the oilskins barks a short whistle of his own—two quick notes—toward the street. It’s not a police whistle; it’s a signal.

From the alley hatch behind you: the padlock finally gives with a sharp metallic *crack*. The chain slackens and drops against the wood.

A hand appears through the hatch seam, fingers pale in the dark, and the hatch **lifts a fraction**—not open yet, but no longer secured. A man’s voice, close and amused, threads into the shop from behind the counter line:

“Lights out. That’s better.”

You’re now boxed: gun angle from the doorframe, baton and bodies at the threshold, and the rear hatch is actively being opened from the alley side.

#### Turn 54 **[PLAYER]**

I keep low and grab the clerk by the sleeve, yanking him down behind the counter with us. To Rusk, a harsh whisper: “Keep that whistle going—don’t stop.”  

I crawl fast along the inside of the counter toward the hatch and jam the pry bar into the hatch gap/hinge line, trying to lever it shut or pin it so it can’t lift. Then I hiss toward the voice in the alley, “Come through and you’re coming in blind—last chance to back off.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re boxed with a gun at the front and a breach at the back; staying static gets us picked off. Darkness is our only advantage—use it to deny the gunman a clean shot and block the hatch before it opens fully. Also keep the whistle going to draw help.*

#### Turn 55 **[GAME]**

You yank the clerk down. He comes easy—almost collapses—ending up wedged beside Rusk behind the counter, cleaver clutched to his chest like it might stop a bullet. Rusk keeps the whistle going; it’s wet and ragged now, but continuous.

You crab-walk along the counter’s inside, keeping your head below the lip. The hatch is right there—boards dark with rain seep and alley grime. It’s lifted a few inches now, enough for fingers and a forearm.

You slam the pry bar into the gap and torque it.

For a second it works: the hatch grinds down and the unseen man’s fingers lose purchase. You feel the bar bite wood. You pin it hard enough that the hatch can’t rise cleanly.

Then pressure comes from the other side—steady, deliberate. Whoever’s out there isn’t just lifting; he’s **prying back** with something long. The hatch bucks against your bar. The wood flexes, and a screw near the hinge line squeals, starting to pull.

The voice in the alley answers, closer now, all calm: “Blind’s fine. I know this shop.”

A thin blade of streetlight cuts through as the hatch is forced up again—only an inch, but enough.

Something cold and metallic snakes through the gap from the alley side: the hooked end of a **crowbar or gaff**, reaching for *your* pry bar to snag it and rip it out of your hands.

At the front, the heavy man calls low, controlled: “He’s at the back. Now.”

Boots thump on the boards—one of the oilskins commits inside, moving fast around the counter’s open end. The baton taps once against wood as he uses it to feel his way in the dim.

You’re holding the hatch down with your pry bar, but you’re now in an active tug-of-war through a gap that’s widening—and a baton-man is closing from the shop side while a gun stays angled from the doorway.

**Immediate threats:** the alley man is trying to hook and yank your pry bar (and your hands with it) through the hatch gap; the hatch hinge hardware is starting to give; an oilskin with a baton is moving to flank you behind the counter.

#### Turn 56 **[PLAYER]**

I let the pry bar go the instant the hook catches, then stomp the hatch down with my heel and drive the cleaver handle-first into the gap toward the reaching hand, aiming to smash fingers. “Rusk—keep screaming that whistle. Clerk—stay down!”

I scramble back along the counter toward the open end, keeping low, and shout toward the doorway, “He’s breaking in through the hatch—gunman, you fire and everyone hears it!”

*Agent reasoning: I’m about to get flanked and disarmed; holding the pry bar is turning into a trap. Better to deny them a clean grab and buy seconds—hurt the hand at the hatch, then reposition to protect Rusk and force them into a worse angle.*

#### Turn 57 **[GAME]**

The hook catches your pry bar with a hard *clink* and you instantly let go.

The alley man yanks—expecting resistance—and the bar whips out through the gap so fast it scrapes wood and throws a splintery squeal. Your heel comes down on the hatch in the same beat. The hatch slams flat with a hollow *WHUMP*, catching whatever was still reaching through.

You snatch the cleaver from the clerk’s death-grip as you move—he doesn’t even protest, just makes a small strangled sound—and you drive the **handle** down into the seam like a hammer.

There’s a sharp, human yelp from the alley side. Then a string of breathy curses. Fingers recoil. Something metal clatters against the outside boards like it got dropped or bumped.

But the hatch doesn’t stay quiet. Immediately, weight hits it from the alley—shoulder or boot—testing it. The hinge line, already stressed, gives a tiny *tick* as a fastener shifts.

You scramble back along the counter, low, and shout your warning toward the doorway.

The heavy man answers by doing the one thing you can’t argue with: he fires **once**—not into the room, but into the ceiling near the door. The shot cracks the shop open like a thunderclap. Plaster dust rains down in a chalky sheet. The clerk screams despite himself. Rusk’s whistle stutters for half a breath, then continues, frantic.

“Now everyone heard it,” the heavy man says, voice raised over the ringing in your ears. “So stop making noise.”

The baton-man who’d come inside uses the gunshot as cover for movement. He’s at the counter’s open end now, just a few strides away in the dim, baton out and ready. “Marrow,” he spits—he knows your name—“come out.”

Behind you, the hatch takes another shove from the alley side—harder. The boards bow a fraction. Whoever’s out there has decided pain isn’t a reason to leave.

**What’s in front of you:** baton-man closing at the counter end; heavy man with a pistol posted at the doorway, now willing to shoot; hatch behind you being forced again, hinge hardware weakening.

#### Turn 58 **[PLAYER]**

I stay low and slide a stack of tins off the counter edge toward the baton-man’s feet to foul his approach, then pop up just enough to fling the cleaver (handle-first) at his face to make him flinch and cover.  

“Rusk—MOVE, now! Crawl for the door on my count—clerk with him!” I bark, then to the gunman, loud: “You know my name—so you know I don’t go quiet. Patrol’s coming either way.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re getting boxed in from three angles; staying here means we lose. The whistle is our only leverage—keep it going—while I try to break their coordination and create a path out, preferably through the front before the hatch gives. A sudden attack on the baton-man could buy seconds without exposing myself to the gun for long.*

#### Turn 59 **[GAME]**

You sweep your arm along the counter lip and a stack of tins—sardines, beans, something in paper sleeves—goes over the edge in a clattering spill.

They hit the floor between you and the baton-man. Two tins roll fast on the damp boards; one pops its lid halfway and skates like a wheel. The baton-man’s boot lands on a rolling tin and his ankle buckles. He catches himself with a hard baton tap on the counter edge, but his forward momentum dies. He’s forced to widen his stance and look down for half a second.

You rise just enough to throw.

The cleaver goes handle-first like you intended, but the throw’s cramped—counter, low ceiling, adrenaline. It doesn’t fly clean. The baton-man snaps his forearm up and the handle **smacks** into his guard with a dull thud, still enough to make him flinch back and cover his face.

But you’ve shown your head.

The heavy man at the doorway fires immediately—not a warning this time. The shot chews a chunk out of the counter’s top edge inches from where you were, spraying wood splinters and powdered laminate across your cheek and into your hair. The bullet’s crack is followed by the clerk’s sobbing inhale and Rusk’s whistle turning into a ragged, panicked trill.

“Count on it,” the heavy man barks, and shifts his aim lower, tracking the counter line. He’s not trying to kill everyone—he’s trying to pin you.

Rusk and the clerk start to move when you shout, but it’s ugly: the clerk crawls first, scrambling on hands and knees toward the door end; Rusk drags himself after, one arm clutched to his shoulder, whistle still in his mouth. They’re exposed for moments as they pass the open end of the counter.

The baton-man—recovering—kicks a tin away and lunges to intercept them, baton raised to crack down on the crawling clerk.

Behind you, the hatch finally gives with a tearing *rip*—a hinge screw pulls free. The hatch lifts a handspan and cold air knifes in. A pale hand, knuckles reddened, shoves through, feeling for purchase on the floorboards.

**Threats, now:** gunman firing to pin you; baton-man about to strike the crawling clerk (and Rusk right behind him); hatch opening behind you with an intruder’s hand already inside.

#### Turn 60 **[PLAYER]**

I lunge low and hook my leg out, kicking the rolling tins straight into the baton-man’s shins to spoil his swing, then grab the counter edge and shove hard to topple more stock down into his path.  

“Rusk—keep crawling, don’t look back!” I snap, then reach back and stomp the hatch hand with my heel, trying to pin it while I drag myself after them toward the door-side cover.

*Agent reasoning: The baton-man is the immediate threat to Rusk and the clerk; the gunman is pinning me, so I need a low, close intervention that doesn’t expose my head. The hatch hand is dangerous but secondary for the next second—buy time by jamming it after I stop the strike.*

#### Turn 61 **[GAME]**

Your foot snaps out and the tins you’d spilled become ammunition. Two catch the baton-man in the shins with hollow *thunks*. He hisses, his swing stutters mid-arc, and the baton clips the counter edge instead of the clerk’s spine—close enough to make the clerk yelp and scramble faster, but it doesn’t land clean.

You grab the counter and heave. A row of boxed goods and glass jars topples off in a dirty cascade. One jar bursts on the floor with a wet crack—pickled something—spreading slick brine across the boards right where the baton-man needs to step. He checks himself again, forced to hop to keep his footing, and for a heartbeat he’s more worried about falling than advancing.

Rusk keeps crawling, whistle still screaming; his free hand claws at the floorboards, dragging him past the counter’s open end. The clerk, wide-eyed and shaking, gets a shoulder against a low shelf near the doorway—partial cover.

You reach back and stomp.

Your heel comes down on the pale hand pushing through the hatch gap. You feel bones shift under your boot. The intruder yowls—high and furious—and tries to yank free.

He doesn’t. Not immediately.

But the hatch is up enough now that he can use his other arm and tool leverage from outside. The torn hinge side flexes again. Your weight pins the hand, but the whole hatch begins to **lift around** your boot, prying up like a jaw.

At the doorway, the heavy man shifts his aim to the crawling bodies and barks, “Don’t let ’em out!”

He fires again—low. The shot punches into the floorboards near Rusk’s trailing leg, splintering wood and making Rusk flinch so hard his whistle cuts out into a gagging cough.

The baton-man, seeing the opening, commits: he slides one boot through the brine and comes in anyway, baton raised again—this time not for the clerk, but angling toward **you**, over the counter line.

Behind you, the pinned hand twists, and you feel something sharp scrape your boot sole—like a small blade or hook trying to cut leather or catch an ankle.

**Immediate threats:** baton-man closing to strike you; gunman now shooting to stop escape; hatch lifting under you while the intruder works a sharp tool against your boot/ankle to break your pin.

#### Turn 62 **[PLAYER]**

I yank my foot off the hatch before the blade catches, then kick the brine-slick jar shards and a tin toward the baton-man’s lead foot to make him slip. I drop low and scramble hard toward the door-side shelving where the clerk’s crouched, hissing, “Rusk—OUT, now! Clerk—stay tight to the shelf!” and shout at the gunman, “You shoot again and you’re explaining it to the patrol yourself!”

*Agent reasoning: I’m about to get boxed in—baton in front, gun at the door, blade at my ankle. I need to break contact and get mobile; keeping my foot pinned risks getting cut or dragged through the hatch. I’ll use the slick brine and clutter to trip the baton-man, then retreat to door-side cover while warning Rusk/clerk.*

#### Turn 63 **[GAME]**

You pull your foot back just as the hatch jerks upward again. Something sharp flashes in the gap—short blade or hook—missing your boot by inches. The pale hand disappears, then reappears higher, gripping the hatch edge with fresh determination.

You snap a tin and a spray of glass shards forward with your toe.

The baton-man’s lead foot comes down half on brine, half on rolling metal. His boot skates. He windmills his free arm, baton sweeping wide and ugly. He doesn’t go fully down, but he *loses the line*—his swing turns into a stumble-step, his shoulder slamming the counter corner with a solid *thud*. He swears and has to catch himself, buying you the heartbeat you needed.

You drop and scramble for the door-side shelving.

The heavy man tracks you with the pistol, jaw tight. Your shout about patrol makes his eyes flick, just once, toward the street—like he’s listening past the rain for sirens that aren’t there yet.

He fires anyway.

Not at you—at the shelving. The round punches through the lower boards with a splintering crack, sending a burst of sawdust and woodchips across the clerk’s hands. The clerk shrieks and presses flatter to the shelf, shaking hard, but he stays put like you told him.

Rusk lurches up from his crawl into a half-crouch and stumbles for the door, favoring his shoulder. He gets one foot over the threshold—

—and the heavy man lunges and **kicks the door inward** against him. The door slams into Rusk’s hip and thigh, folding him sideways into the jamb. Rusk grunts, wind knocked out, whistle clattering out of his mouth and skittering across the floor.

“Out?” the heavy man says, voice low and mean. “Not tonight.”

Behind you, the hatch lifts higher with a tearing squeal. An arm and shoulder force through now—oilskin sleeve, wet to the elbow. Whoever it is has leverage and they’re coming in fast, blade-hand still low.

**What’s happening now:** Rusk is pinned at the doorway by the gunman and the door; the clerk is in cover but terrified; baton-man is recovering from the slip and reorienting on you; the hatch intruder is halfway in with a small blade/hook and closing.

#### Turn 64 **[PLAYER]**

I snatch up the skittered whistle and fling it hard toward the back/hatch to draw eyes, then I grab a tin and whip it at the gunman’s face to make him flinch. “Rusk—DROP and roll out when he blinks!” I shout, then I hook an arm under Rusk’s shoulder and yank him down and away from the jamb, trying to drag him behind the shelf line.

*Agent reasoning: We’re getting boxed in from two sides; the door is the only exit but it’s controlled. I need to create a distraction and buy seconds—get the gunman’s attention off Rusk, and keep distance from the hatch intruder’s blade without committing to a close fight.*

#### Turn 65 **[GAME]**

You snatch the whistle off the boards—cold metal, slick with rainwater and spit—and whip it toward the back.

It clatters off the hatch edge with a sharp, bright *ting-ting-ting* that cuts through the gunfire noise like a signal. The oilskin-sleeved intruder flinches and turns his head toward it on instinct, shoulders twisting as he hauls himself in.

You grab a tin and throw it at the gunman.

It hits him high—cheekbone/eye line—with a dull *whomp*. He jerks back, one hand snapping up to his face. The pistol dips. He doesn’t drop it, but his stance breaks and his next shot doesn’t come.

“Bast—” he starts, muffled behind his palm.

“Rusk—DROP—” you shout, and you’re already moving.

You hook under Rusk’s good side and yank him down. He goes with it, more collapse than roll, and you drag him off the jamb line toward the shelving. His boots scrape furrows in spilled brine and grit. He’s heavy and half-stunned; his injured shoulder makes him gasp through clenched teeth.

The door swings wider as his weight leaves it.

The gunman recovers fast—too fast. He shoves the door with his boot to close the gap again and snaps the pistol down toward the floor line where you’re hauling Rusk.

The shot cracks and bites into the boards just behind your dragging hand, sending a splinter into your knuckles. Not a clean hit, but close enough you feel the sting and warmth.

The baton-man, seeing you committed to Rusk, surges around the counter end. He raises the baton two-handed, aiming for the back of your skull/shoulder as you crouch-drag.

From the back, the hatch intruder commits fully: he slides in on his belly, oilskins squealing on wood, and reaches forward with the small hook-blade toward your ankle—going low, trying to catch you while you’re pinned to Rusk.

Rusk is now partly behind the shelf line with you, but you’re exposed on three sides:
- gunman has a clear low-angle shot lane again,
- baton-man is a step away with the baton coming down,
- intruder is inside, blade reaching for your leg.

#### Turn 66 **[PLAYER]**

I let go of Rusk and shove him fully behind the shelving, then I drop flat and roll under the lowest shelf board, yanking my legs in so the hook-blade misses. “Clerk—stay down and don’t move!” I hiss, then grab for anything heavy under the shelf to throw at the baton-man’s knees as he swings.

*Agent reasoning: I’m seconds from getting cracked in the head or hooked in the ankle; I need to break their timing and get real cover. The shelf is my only hard barrier—get behind it and force them to come to me.*

#### Turn 67 **[GAME]**

You shove Rusk hard. He slides the last couple feet on his side and thumps into the shadow behind the shelving, out of the gunman’s clean line. He curls instinctively, one arm over his head, breathing ragged.

You go flat.

The hook-blade snaps through the space where your ankle was a moment ago and catches only air and the edge of a floorboard. The intruder’s arm jerks, frustrated, and the blade scrapes wood with a tearing squeal.

You roll under the lowest shelf board—tight, dusty, smelling of old grain and leaking brine—and yank your legs in. The clerk is right above you on the other side of the shelf supports, whimpering, hands clamped over his mouth. At your hiss he nods violently without making a sound.

The baton-man’s swing comes down where you’d been.

The baton smashes the floor with a crack that stings your ears under the shelf. He loses balance for a half-step, then drops his stance and jabs the baton low, trying to spear it under the shelf to catch you.

Your hand finds something heavy under there: a squat iron weight—probably a doorstop or scale weight—cold and greasy with dust.

You throw it blind toward his knees.

It hits. A solid *clang* against shinbone. The baton-man barks in pain and his probing jab falters, baton scraping along the shelf edge instead of driving in.

But the move costs you: the gunman, seeing you vanish under the shelf, lowers his aim and fires into the baseboard line anyway. The shot punches through the shelving upright with a sharp *whack*, showering you with splinters and dust. The round doesn’t hit you, but it chews away cover—there’s now a ragged hole at floor level with daylight-gray rainlight bleeding through it.

From the back, the oilskin intruder crawls closer on elbows, blade hand feeling along the floor for you. He can’t see you well, but he’s close enough that his wet sleeve brushes the shelf’s bottom edge.

The baton-man shifts tactics: limping, he plants a boot and starts to squat, reaching for the shelf frame like he means to **tip it** or rip it aside.

**Threats now:** gunman is shooting through the shelf base; intruder is within arm’s reach, probing with the hook-blade; baton-man is about to overturn or drag the shelving to expose you, Rusk, and the clerk.

“Rusk—stay flat. Clerk—hands over your head.” I hiss, then kick my feet hard against the shelf’s base supports to buck it back as the baton-man tries to tip it. 

With my free hand I snatch up anything loose under here (cans, a bottle, whatever) and shove it through the splinter-hole toward the gunman’s line to spoil his aim, then I reach out low and slash/grab for the baton-man’s ankle to pull his footing out from under him while he’s mid-lift.

*Agent reasoning: If he tips the shelf, we’re dead in the open. I need to stop the lift, jam the structure, and create a distraction/escape route without exposing us to the gunman’s line.*

#### Turn 69 **[GAME]**

“Rusk—stay flat. Clerk—hands over your head.”

Rusk makes a tight, pained sound but he stays curled behind the shelving. The clerk’s hands come up over his skull, elbows tucked, eyes squeezed shut like he’s waiting for the shelf to fall on him.

The baton-man gets his fingers under the shelf frame and heaves.

You kick hard against the base supports from underneath. The whole unit bucks—wood groans, nails squeal. It doesn’t tip over onto you, but it **slams back down** on his hands and shins. He yelps and hops a half-step, losing his leverage. The shelf stays upright.

Under the shelf your hand finds loose stock: two dented cans and a glass bottle on its side.

You shove them through the ragged bullet-hole toward the gunman’s lane. The bottle goes first, skittering and then **shattering** near the doorway in a wet crackle. The cans roll after it, clanging loud and erratic.

The gunman flinches and shifts his feet to avoid the glass. His pistol tracks down and left—his sightline spoiled for a moment—but he doesn’t stop shooting. He fires again, lower and tighter, aiming through the same weakened upright.

The round punches through and **clips you**: a hot, tearing graze along your upper arm/shoulder as splinters and fabric burst. Not a disabling hit, but it bleeds immediately, warm and fast.

You reach out low for the baton-man’s ankle as he tries to reset his grip.

Your fingers catch boot leather and you yank. He’s already off-balance from the buck; your pull finishes it. His foot slides on brine and shattered grain, and he goes down hard on his hip with a hollow *thud*, baton clattering out of his hand and spinning under the counter.

He snarls, scrambling for the baton with one hand and for you with the other.

At the same time the oilskin intruder commits: the hook-blade darts under the shelf toward the movement of your arm. It catches your sleeve and **tugs**, trying to drag you out by the arm you just used. You feel the blade bite cloth; if you jerk wrong it’ll bite skin.

The gunman, now angry and half-blinded by pain and glass, barks: “Tip it! Tip the damn shelf!”

And you hear it—outside, faint but real through the rain: a patrol whistle answering somewhere down the block. Not close yet, but coming.

**Immediate threats:** you’re bleeding from a graze; the intruder has your sleeve with the hook-blade and is pulling; baton-man is down but reaching; gunman still has a shot lane through the torn shelving and is trying to force the shelf to be moved.

#### Turn 70 **[PLAYER]**

I go still for half a beat, then twist my arm to slacken the fabric and yank backward hard, ripping my sleeve free from the hook-blade even if it tears—anything to keep skin off that edge. 

“PATROL’S COMING!” I shout toward the front, loud enough for the street, then hiss to Rusk, “When they hesitate—crawl for the door, stay low.” I grab the nearest loose can and ram/throw it point-first at the intruder’s reaching hand under the shelf, trying to make him recoil and buy us room.

*Agent reasoning: I’m pinned and bleeding; if I fight the hook-blade wrong I’ll get sliced and dragged out into the gunman’s lane. Better to sacrifice the sleeve, create distance, and use the incoming patrol whistle as leverage to force a retreat while keeping Rusk and the clerk covered.*

#### Turn 71 **[GAME]**

You freeze for a half-beat—just long enough to feel the hook-blade’s tension on your sleeve—then twist your arm inward to slack the cloth and yank back hard.

The fabric tears with a ripping *rrrk*. You come free.

The hook-blade doesn’t bite your skin, but the sudden pull makes your grazed shoulder flare; blood smears along the torn seam and down your forearm. The intruder’s hand jerks forward as the resistance vanishes, knuckles smacking the floorboards.

“PATROL’S COMING!” you yell toward the front, voice bouncing off the tin ceiling and out the broken doorway gap.

Outside, the rain eats some of it—but not all. You hear a muffled shout from the street in answer, then hurried footsteps splashing closer. Not right on top of you yet, but no longer hypothetical.

Inside, the gunman snaps his head toward the street sound. “Shit—” He shifts position, angling his body to keep the door and the shelf both in view. The pistol stays up, but his confidence cracks; he’s thinking about exits now.

You hiss to Rusk, “When they hesitate—crawl for the door, stay low.”

Rusk gives a tight nod you can barely see behind the shelving, jaw clenched hard enough to show white.

You grab the nearest loose can—heavy, sealed—and drive it point-first under the shelf toward the oilskin intruder’s reaching hand.

It hits his fingers with a sharp *clang* and a wet curse. He recoils on instinct, hand snapping back. The hook-blade scrapes the floor as he retreats a foot, shaking his hand like it’s gone numb.

That buys you a sliver of space—but it also gives him an idea. He jams the hook-blade into the shelf’s bottom edge and **starts sawing at the wood**, trying to widen the gap and get purchase to drag you out properly.

The baton-man, still on the floor near the counter, finds his baton with his fingertips and drags it back toward him. He’s breathing hard, pain-rage in his voice: “Got her under there.”

The gunman barks, louder now, toward the back: “Two minutes. Then we’re gone.”

And from outside—closer—another whistle blast cuts through the rain, accompanied by a voice: “Harbor Patrol! In there—hands where I can see ’em!”

They’re arriving at the front, but you’re still under the shelf with an intruder cutting at your cover, a baton-man rearming, and a gunman who may decide to shoot first and run.

#### Turn 72 **[PLAYER]**

I shout toward the door, “PATROL—GUN! He’s got a pistol by the entrance!” Then I wriggle backward under the shelf toward Rusk’s side, keeping my head low, and kick out at the intruder’s blade-hand whenever it comes close. “Rusk, on my pull—crawl!” I grab Rusk’s belt/coat and start dragging him a few inches at a time toward the doorway side, staying in cover.

*Agent reasoning: Patrol arriving is our leverage; I want them seeing the gun first. But I can’t get trapped under the shelf if the intruder opens it up, so I need to shift position and keep the gunman from firing at the officers.*

#### Turn 73 **[GAME]**

“PATROL—GUN! He’s got a pistol by the entrance!”

Your voice punches out into the rain. There’s a half-beat of silence, then the patrolman outside barks back, closer and sharper: “DROP IT! NOW!”

The gunman doesn’t drop anything. Boots scuff on glass. He shifts to use the doorframe as cover—then fires toward the voice outside.

The shot cracks like a snapped mast. You hear a grunt and a scrape as someone outside hits the wall or crouches hard. The patrolman answers instantly: “GUN—GUN—” and you hear his whistle again, urgent, a different cadence—calling backup.

Inside, the gunman retreats a step deeper into the shop, trying to keep sightlines while not being a silhouette in the doorway. He’s still armed and still shooting-capable, but he’s now pinned between the patrol outside and the mess inside.

You wriggle backward under the shelf toward Rusk’s side, cheek skimming gritty floorboards. The oilskin intruder lunges his hook-blade under after you; you kick out on reflex. Your heel catches his wrist. He hisses and the blade skitters, carving a shallow groove in the wood where your calf had been.

“Rusk, on my pull—crawl!”

You get a fistful of his belt/coat hem and start dragging him inches at a time. Rusk cooperates—elbows and knees, staying low—face tight with pain. He moves, but not fast; every pull draws a sharp breath out of him.

The baton-man, now back on a knee, spots what you’re doing. He doesn’t try to tip the shelf again—he jabs the baton under at floor level, aiming for your hands.

The baton clips your knuckles. Pain flashes white; your grip almost breaks, but you keep hold of Rusk’s coat and yank again. Blood from your grazed shoulder smears on the floor where you’ve slid.

The intruder changes angle, crawling along the shelf line to cut you off, hook-blade fishing for your ankle again—closer now because you’ve backed toward the shelf’s end.

Outside the door, the patrolman shouts, strained: “I need a wagon—armed suspect—Pier Nine district—now!” He’s alive, but he’s staying behind cover; he’s not storming in yet.

**What’s true right now:** you’ve moved Rusk a couple feet toward the doorway side under cover; the gunman is still active and has fired on patrol; the baton-man is stabbing under the shelf at your hands; the hook-blade intruder is repositioning to snag your legs as you near the shelf’s end.

#### Turn 74 **[PLAYER]**

“Patrol—don’t rush! He’s inside the doorway, shooting from cover!” I shout, then I shrug out of my coat and whip the loose fabric toward the baton tip to snag/jam it under the shelf. 

I keep one hand locked on Rusk’s belt and drag again, inching him toward the shelf’s end, then kick hard at the hook-blade whenever it probes—aiming for wrist and blade to buy us one clean gap to slip out low.

*Agent reasoning: We’re close to the shelf’s end, which is a kill zone if I pop out. I need the patrol to draw the gunman’s attention while I keep Rusk moving, and I need to stop the baton from targeting my hands—disarm or jam it—without exposing myself to the hook-blade.*

#### Turn 75 **[GAME]**

“Patrol—don’t rush! He’s inside the doorway, shooting from cover!”

Outside, the patrolman answers, voice tight behind cover: “Heard you! Stay down!” Boots splash—he shifts position rather than pushing in.

You shrug out of your coat in the cramped space. The move stings your grazed shoulder; warm blood slicks your upper arm as the fabric peels away. You whip the coat toward the baton as it jabs under the shelf.

It works—partly.

The baton tip catches in the coat lining for a second and you yank, trying to foul it. The baton-man reacts fast: he twists and **pins the coat with the baton**, then stomps the hanging fabric to the floor with his boot. The coat is trapped and the baton is momentarily slowed, but not neutralized.

You keep one hand locked on Rusk’s belt and drag again. Rusk crawls when you pull, teeth clenched, one knee dragging like it doesn’t want to bend. You gain another couple feet—close enough now that you can see the shelf’s end: a thin strip of open floor beyond it, exposed to the room.

The oilskin intruder probes with the hook-blade, fishing for your ankle as you near that edge. You kick hard.

Your heel smacks his wrist, then the flat of the blade. The hook-blade skips away with a metallic scrape and he swears, shaking out his hand. That buys you a clean half-second.

Then he changes tactics: he drives the hook-blade **down into the floorboard seam** near the shelf end and yanks, trying to lever the board up—creating a jagged lip right where you’d slide out. Splinters lift; a nail squeals.

The baton-man, still kneeling, gives up on stabbing for a beat and **lunges to grab Rusk’s ankle** as Rusk’s legs come near the shelf’s edge. His fingers brush trouser fabric—almost a hold.

At the doorway, the gunman fires again—two quick shots—this time not at you but at the patrolman’s cover outside. Plaster dust puffs in through the entrance. The patrolman yells in pain or alarm—hard to tell—and returns one shot into the shop. The round smashes a jar behind the counter; glass rains down.

You and Rusk are now **one body-length** from slipping out from under the shelf end—but the exit point is becoming a trap: a prying floorboard lip, an intruder poised to snag your legs, and a baton-man reaching for Rusk.

#### Turn 76 **[PLAYER]**

I clamp both hands on Rusk’s belt and yank him back an inch—just enough to break the baton-man’s reach—then kick out hard at the baton-man’s fingers and forearm. “PATROL—FLASH IN! We’re under the shelf on the right!” I shout, then use my coat as a thick pad to smack down and trap the hook-blade against the floorboards for a heartbeat while I drag Rusk forward in one committed pull toward the shelf’s end.

*Agent reasoning: The shelf end is turning into a kill zone; we need to stop the grab and the hook long enough to slip out low, then immediately get the patrol’s attention without exposing ourselves to the gunman.*

#### Turn 77 **[GAME]**

You clamp both hands on Rusk’s belt and yank him back a hard inch.

It’s just enough. The baton-man’s reaching hand closes on empty air instead of Rusk’s ankle, fingers scraping wet floorboards. You kick out immediately—your heel catches his knuckles and then his forearm.

He yelps and recoils, cradling his hand. “Bitch—!”

“PATROL—FLASH IN! We’re under the shelf on the right!” you shout.

Outside, the patrolman answers without moving in yet: “I DON’T HAVE A FLASH—STAY DOWN!” His voice is closer now, angled like he’s pressed to the wall by the door.

You swing your coat like a heavy pad and slap it down over the hook-blade as it scrapes for you. For a heartbeat, you’ve got it: fabric pinned under your palm, the blade’s curve trapped against the floorboards.

The oilskin intruder snarls and **yanks**. The hook-blade tears through the coat lining with a brutal *shhk* and rips free. The coat saves your hand from being cut, but it’s shredded and no longer a reliable block.

You commit—one full pull on Rusk’s belt, dragging him forward toward the shelf’s end.

Rusk slides out first, low and scrambling, shoulder and hip clearing the shelf into open floor. You follow, but the moment your legs reach that jagged floorboard lip the intruder pried up, it bites: a nail catches your trouser cuff and **snags** you mid-slide.

At the same instant, the baton-man lunges again—this time grabbing for *you*, not Rusk. His good hand clamps your ankle.

You’re half out, half in: Rusk is in the open, low; you’re pinned by a snagged cuff and a grip on your ankle.

The gunman, hearing movement, snaps his pistol toward the shelf end. He doesn’t fire yet—he’s checking the doorway and you in the same glance—but the muzzle is coming around.

Outside, you hear another set of boots arriving at a run and a shouted order: “RUSK? RUSK, SOUND OFF!”

Rusk, on the floor, croaks out, “Here—!” and tries to crawl toward the counter for cover, leaving you momentarily exposed at the shelf’s edge with a man on your ankle and a pistol turning your way.

#### Turn 78 **[PLAYER]**

I go limp for a split-second, then twist my trapped leg inward and stomp my free heel down hard on the baton-man’s gripping hand. “PATROL—HE’S GOT ME BY THE ANKLE, GUNMAN’S TURNING ON THE SHELF END—PUSH NOW!”

I claw at my snagged cuff and yank it free even if it tears, then roll low toward the counter side after Rusk, keeping my head flat to the floor and using the shelf corner as cover.

*Agent reasoning: I’m pinned and a pistol is coming around—priority is to break the ankle grip and get out of the snag without presenting a target. Noise and patrol presence are my leverage, so I’ll call for them to push while I make myself a bad shot and slip free.*

#### Turn 79 **[GAME]**

You go limp for the half-beat—ankle slack in his grip—then twist inward and bring your free heel down like a hammer.

Your heel lands on the baton-man’s gripping hand with a wet crunch. He howls and his fingers spring open. His forearm jerks back under the shelf edge, and he scrambles away on his knees, cradling the hand against his chest.

“PATROL—HE’S GOT ME BY THE ANKLE, GUNMAN’S TURNING ON THE SHELF END—PUSH NOW!”

Outside, the newly arrived voice barks, “MOVE—MOVE!” Boots slap water; someone takes the doorway angle.

You claw at your snagged cuff. The nail has you good. You yank anyway—fabric tears with a sharp rip, and the cuff comes free, leaving a jagged strip of trouser leg behind on the nail.

You roll low toward the counter side after Rusk, head flat, shoulder scraping grit. The shelf corner gives you a sliver of cover for a breath—

—then the gunman commits. He fires at the shelf end where you *were*.

The shot punches into the floorboards behind you with a splintering crack; wood chips sting your cheek. A second shot follows immediately, lower and wider, and you feel heat whip past your ear—close enough to make your hearing ring.

Rusk crawls hard toward the counter, dragging his bad leg, and he knocks into a fallen chair leg. It clatters, loud in the small shop.

The oilskin intruder with the hook-blade surges out from the shelf line, trying to follow your roll, but he hesitates as the doorway fills: a patrolman’s silhouette and a raised revolver appear in the entrance.

“DROP IT!” the newcomer roars.

The gunman snaps his pistol toward the door instead of finishing you. He fires once at the silhouette. The patrolman at the entrance jerks back out of sight, and you hear a pained shout and a body hitting the wet brick outside.

Now the shop has two active threats in motion: the gunman trading fire with patrol at the doorway, and the hook-blade intruder angling to cut you off from the counter while you’re still on the floor, exposed between shelf and counter with your coat shredded and your pant leg torn.

#### Turn 80 **[PLAYER]**

I crawl fast and flat for the back side of the counter, grabbing Rusk’s collar to tug him with me into cover. “Rusk—stay down. Find something heavy or sharp, now.”

Without lifting my head, I shout toward the doorway, “Gunman’s using the doorframe—hook-blade man is inside, moving right toward the counter!” Then I reach up just enough to sweep for anything behind the counter—bottle, metal rod, drawer handle—something to use as a weapon or to throw.

*Agent reasoning: I’m exposed between shelf and counter; I need hard cover and to avoid drawing fire. The hook-blade is the immediate close threat, while patrol can keep the gunman busy. I’ll get behind the counter, arm Rusk with something, and give patrol clear target info without standing up.*

#### Turn 81 **[GAME]**

You crawl fast and flat, palms sliding through spilled syrup and glass grit, and hook two fingers into the back of Rusk’s collar. He grunts as you yank him the last yard into the dead space behind the counter. His bad leg drags, but he’s in cover with you—both of you pressed to the baseboards, breathing hard.

“Rusk—stay down. Find something heavy or sharp, now.”

Rusk nods once, face grey, and starts pawing blindly along the floor behind the counter with one hand, the other clamped to his ribs.

You keep your head low and shout toward the doorway, “Gunman’s using the doorframe—hook-blade man is inside, moving right toward the counter!”

Outside, someone answers through clenched pain: “I HEARD—” followed by a sharper voice, closer to the threshold: “CLEAR THE DOOR!”

A gunshot cracks—this time from outside into the shop. The round smacks the inner doorframe and spits wood into the air. The gunman curses and shifts his angle, no longer comfortably posted.

You reach up just enough to sweep behind the counter. Your fingers find:

- A squat **glass bottle** (cheap spirits), slick with condensation.
- A **steel can-opener** the size of your palm, sharp-edged and utilitarian.
- A **drawer** that’s half-open—inside, your hand brushes **coins**, a stubby **pencil**, and a **thin metal skewer** (for olives or pickles).
- A **heavy brass bell** bolted to the counter edge—too fixed to take, but right where you could smash a hand into it.

As you’re feeling around, the hook-blade intruder appears at the counter’s far end—oilskin shoulder and forearm sliding into view low. He’s moving carefully, using the counter as a guide, hook-blade held inverted to catch ankles.

He doesn’t see you yet, but he’s close—six feet, then five—closing on your position behind the counter.

Rusk whispers, hoarse: “Got… something.” You hear metal scrape. He’s found a **meat tenderizer**—short handle, heavy head—likely dropped from the earlier struggle, and he grips it like he’s afraid his hand will fail.

At the doorway, boots splash—someone is trying to push in, but the gunman is still there, trading angles. The immediate threat is the hook-blade man about to round the counter end and look down into your cover.

#### Turn 82 **[PLAYER]**

I press the bottle into Rusk’s hand and whisper, “If he pops up—smash and swing.” I keep the can-opener in my fist, then flick the thin skewer low across the floor toward the far end of the counter to make a faint clink away from us; as the hook-blade rounds the corner, I stay prone and slash up at his Achilles/ankle with the can-opener, then immediately scoot back deeper into cover.

*Agent reasoning: The hook-blade man is the closest threat and hasn’t spotted me yet. I need to stop him silently and fast while keeping Rusk protected; a distraction for the gunman/patrol can come second.*

#### Turn 83 **[GAME]**

You press the cold bottle into Rusk’s hand. He takes it with a shaking grip, nodding once like it costs him something.

“If he pops up—smash and swing.”

You keep the can-opener tight in your fist—thumb braced along the spine—then flick the thin skewer flat along the floor. It skitters under the counter’s far lip and taps metal with a faint *clink… clink* as it comes to rest near the other end.

The hook-blade man’s head and shoulder dip toward that sound. He shifts his weight and edges along the counter line toward the far end—exactly the wrong way for a clean approach on you, but it also brings his legs past your cover.

He rounds the corner.

You stay prone and slash upward.

The can-opener’s sharp edge bites into the back of his ankle—more of a ripping gouge than a clean cut—but it hits tendon-rich flesh. He jerks like he’s been stung by a live wire and slams his boot down hard, trying to pin your hand.

You yank back in time; the sole thumps the floor where your knuckles were. Blood immediately darkens the cuff of his oilskin trouser leg and runs into his boot.

He snarls, breath hissing through teeth. “Down there—!”

Instead of retreating, he drops to a knee and jabs the hook-blade under the counter, sweeping for your shins in a short, vicious arc. The blade catches the torn edge of your pant leg and tugs—hard—trying to drag you out by the fabric.

You scoot back deeper into cover, hips and shoulders scraping, and the fabric tears again. The hook-blade comes away with a strip of cloth, not you.

Rusk rises just enough to strike. He smashes the bottle down onto the intruder’s forearm.

Glass bursts with a sharp crack. The intruder recoils, arm snapping back, oilskin sleeve glittering with wet shards and liquor. He yelps and staggers sideways, his injured ankle buckling for a half-step—then he catches himself on the counter, breathing fast, bleeding and angry.

At the doorway, another gunshot bangs—closer now—and the gunman barks, “KEEP YOUR HEADS DOWN!” His voice is inside the shop, not outside.

Threats now: the hook-blade man is wounded but still mobile at the counter end, and the gunman has pushed in enough that any movement above counter height risks drawing fire.

#### Turn 84 **[PLAYER]**

I grab Rusk’s wrist and pull him down. “Stay low—don’t give the doorway a silhouette.”

I shout toward the patrol, “GUNMAN IS INSIDE THE THRESHOLD, SHOOTING IN—HOOK-BLADE’S WOUNDED AT THE COUNTER END, RIGHT SIDE!”

Then I crawl a foot closer along the baseboard and jab the can-opener into the hook-blade man’s wounded ankle again—hard—trying to drop him, and immediately yank back under the counter before he can hook my legs.

*Agent reasoning: We’re pinned by the gunman’s line of sight, so I need to stay low, reduce the hook-blade threat, and give patrol usable info without exposing myself. If we can disable the hook-blade man’s mobility, patrol can handle the gunman.*

#### Turn 85 **[GAME]**

You clamp Rusk’s wrist and haul him down. He goes with it, shoulders hitting the baseboard, bottle shards crunching under his sleeve.

“Stay low—don’t give the doorway a silhouette.”

You shout toward the patrol, “GUNMAN IS INSIDE THE THRESHOLD, SHOOTING IN—HOOK-BLADE’S WOUNDED AT THE COUNTER END, RIGHT SIDE!”

Outside, a voice answers—tight, controlled: “COPY!” A second later: “BACK—LET ME SEE HIM—” Someone’s trying to get a clean lane past the doorframe without stepping into it.

You crawl a foot closer along the baseboard, keeping your head below the counter lip. The hook-blade man is braced against the counter end, weight off the bad ankle—breathing hard, trying to decide whether to come over the top or fish for you again.

You jab the can-opener into the same wounded ankle, hard.

It goes in with resistance—then a sudden give. He screams, sharp and involuntary, and his leg kicks out. His ankle buckles completely; his knee slams to the floor with a heavy *thud*. The hook-blade clatters as his grip spasms.

But his pain buys you only a heartbeat. His free hand lashes down and grabs for you by feel—fingers catching your coat sleeve near the elbow. He yanks, trying to drag you into the open at the counter end where he can get the hook-blade back under you.

You wrench backward under the counter. Your sleeve rips; you slip free and skid back into deeper cover, forearm stinging where fabric tore.

The hook-blade man is now half-collapsed at the counter end, one knee down, one hand clamped around his ankle, bleeding into his boot. He’s not out—just hurt and furious—and he’s groping for his dropped hook-blade, patting the floor with shaking fingers.

At the threshold, the gunman reacts to your shout by snapping his pistol toward the counter line. He fires twice, fast, trying to punch rounds through the counter’s upper panels where he thinks you are.

Both shots hit wood above you—one blows a fist-sized splintered crater through the counter face, the other punches into a drawer. Coins erupt and rain down behind the counter, stinging your knuckles and cheek with metal flecks and wood shards.

Rusk flinches and curls tighter, breathing ragged.

Immediate threats are clear: the gunman has a firing angle into the counter face and is actively walking shots along it, and the hook-blade man—wounded—still has reach if he gets that hook-blade back in hand.

#### Turn 86 **[PLAYER]**

I grab a fistful of spilled coins and snap my wrist, scattering them hard across the floor toward the doorway to draw the gunman’s aim off our exact spot. “PATROL—HE’S FIRING THROUGH THE COUNTER FACE; WAIT FOR HIS RELOAD THEN PUSH LEFT!” I hiss to Rusk, “On my pull—crawl deeper, stay glued to the baseboard.”

Then I belly-crawl toward the counter end and, keeping low, hook the dropped hook-blade with the can-opener’s edge and drag it back under the counter toward me, away from the wounded man’s reaching hand.

*Agent reasoning: The gunman’s firing into the counter; staying put gets us shredded. The hook-blade is wounded and momentarily distracted—best chance is to disarm him quietly while patrol pins the gunman. I need to signal patrol a safe angle and move Rusk to better cover.*

I freeze behind the counter, keeping my head down. “I need a quick read—where are the gunman and the wounded hook-blade now, and is patrol still outside the doorway or has anyone entered?”

*Agent reasoning: With the scene unclear, I need to confirm positions and immediate threats before making a move that could expose us to the gunman or the hook-blade.*

#### Turn 89 **[GAME]**

You go still. Cheek to the gritty floor, you listen through the counter’s buzzing silence—wood settling, coins rolling to a stop, someone breathing like they’re trying not to.

**Gunman:** He’s **just inside the threshold**, not fully committed into the shop—close enough that rain air and street noise still leak around him. His boots scrape on the wet entry tile as he shifts for angle. You hear him mutter, “—damn—” then a quick metallic *tap* against the doorframe: he’s using it as cover while he leans in and out. His pistol isn’t firing right now; you catch the small, distinct sounds of **a magazine being seated** and a slide being worked—he’s **reloading/confirming** rather than shooting blind.

**Hook-blade man:** He’s at the **counter end, right side**, half down. One knee is on the floor; the other foot is planted wrong, forced to carry weight it can’t. He’s **hissing through clenched teeth** with his hand clamped around the ankle you opened up. With the other hand he’s **patting the floor**, feeling for the dropped hook-blade. He hasn’t found it yet—his fingers keep sweeping the same small patch near the counter leg, jittery and desperate.

**Patrol:** They’re **still outside the doorway**, not in the shop. You hear two sets of footsteps repositioning on wet pavement and a voice—strained, authoritative—calling, “HARBOR PATROL! DROP IT AND STEP OUT!” Another voice answers low: “He’s using the frame—can’t see his hands.” No one enters; they’re trying to get an angle without crossing the fatal funnel.

**Immediate threat:** the gunman is about to lean in again with a fresh mag, and the hook-blade man is close to either recovering his blade or grabbing whatever limb he can reach if you drift toward the counter end.

#### Turn 90 **[PLAYER]**

I hiss to Rusk, “Now—crawl deeper, slow, stay flat,” and shove the loose coins toward him to keep his hands busy and low. 

I whisper-shout toward the doorway, “PATROL—HE’S RELOADING AT THE FRAME, DON’T PUSH THE THRESHOLD—ANGLE LEFT AND HOLD!” 

Then I belly-crawl toward the counter end and, staying under the lip, hook the dropped hook-blade with my can-opener and drag it back under the counter toward me, away from his searching hand.

*Agent reasoning: Gunman is reloading—brief window. Hook-blade is disarmed but searching; I should deny him the weapon and help patrol get a safe angle without exposing myself.*

#### Turn 91 **[GAME]**

Rusk nods once—more a twitch than a gesture—and starts to worm backward along the baseboard, shoulders scraping plaster. You shove a spill of coins toward him; he instinctively cups them, keeping his hands low and giving him something to do besides panic. A couple coins skitter out anyway, ticking softly under the counter.

Your whisper-shout carries. Outside, a patrolman answers, “LEFT SIDE—MOVE!” Boots splash in the alley. Another voice—closer to the frame—barks, “DON’T CROSS!” They’re taking your instruction, but they still won’t commit through the threshold.

You belly-crawl toward the counter end. The air is thicker there—blood and old floor cleaner. The wounded hook-blade man’s fingers are still sweeping, closer now, frantic.

You slide the can-opener out and catch the hook-blade’s handle on the opener’s edge. It drags with a harsh scrape across the floorboards.

The wounded man hears it instantly. He lunges—fast despite the ankle—arm shooting under the counter. His hand clamps onto the hook-blade’s curved metal, not the handle, and he howls as the edge bites his palm. He doesn’t let go. He yanks back hard, trying to pull it out of your leverage.

You pull the other way. For a second it’s a tug-of-war under the counter: his bleeding hand on steel, your can-opener hooked and straining, the blade shivering between you.

At the doorway, the gunman snaps back in with his fresh mag. He fires once—low—aiming by sound at the scrape. The round punches through the counter face near the end and detonates a drawer rail. Splinters whip across your forearm and cheek; the impact thuds through the wood inches above your head.

The hook-blade jerks in the wounded man’s grip at the shot. His injured ankle shifts; he grunts and momentarily loses strength.

You gain a few inches—enough to pull the hook-blade’s handle under the counter lip toward your side—but he’s still got a bloody grip on the metal, and the gunman now has a confirmed sound cue at the counter end.

Threats, clear: **gunman is actively shooting into the counter end**; **the wounded man is half-attached to the hook-blade and can still lunge/grab under the counter**.

#### Turn 92 **[PLAYER]**

I go still for half a beat, then slam my heel into his wounded ankle and twist the hook-blade sideways with the can-opener to make the edge bite his palm harder. “Let go or you lose the hand,” I hiss, then yank the handle fully under the counter and shove it back behind me out of his reach.

Without lifting my head, I call toward the doorway, “PATROL—HOLD FIRE A SECOND, I’M DISARMING HIM AT THE COUNTER END—GUNMAN’S STILL USING SOUND!” Then I crab-crawl back a foot to quieter cover, keeping the hook-blade low and tight to my body.

*Agent reasoning: Tug-of-war is getting me shot at; I need to break his grip and deny him the blade fast, then get quiet so the gunman loses the sound cue. Use his injured hand/ankle against him, and coordinate patrol to hold fire until they have an angle.*

#### Turn 93 **[GAME]**

Your heel finds his ankle like a nail finds soft wood.

He makes a sound that isn’t a word—air torn out of him—and his leg buckles. The wounded joint rolls; you feel the tremor of it through the floorboards. His grip spasms on the hook-blade’s metal, and when you twist sideways with the can-opener the edge chews deeper into his palm. Warm blood slicks the blade; his fingers finally betray him.

“—NO—” he chokes, and lets go.

You yank the handle fully under the counter and shove it back behind your ribs, tight and low. The hook-blade’s weight is ugly in your hand—balanced for tearing, not fencing.

At the doorway, your shout lands. Outside, a patrol voice snaps, “HOLD—HOLD!” Boots shuffle back from the frame. But the gunman isn’t patrol.

He fires again anyway—two quick shots, timed right after your voice. One round punches through the counter face where your mouth just was; the other skips off something metal inside the drawer cavity and ricochets with a vicious whine. Splinters sting your knuckles as you crab-crawl back into quieter shadow.

The wounded man, now disarmed, doesn’t lunge for the blade—he lunges for you. His bloody hand shoots under the counter, clawing for your coat hem. His fingers catch fabric and drag, weak but desperate, trying to anchor you so the gunman can finish it.

Rusk, deeper down the counter line, hisses through his teeth, “Lena—!” He doesn’t rise; you hear him scrabble at the coins you shoved him, using them to stay low and inch farther from the counter end.

Outside, patrol keeps their line—no one enters—but you hear one of them call, “GUN—DROP IT!” followed by the hard clack of a longarm being shouldered.

Immediate threats now: **the gunman is shooting by sound through the counter**, and **the wounded man has a grip on your coat and is trying to hold you in place**. You’ve got the hook-blade secured behind you.

#### Turn 94 **[PLAYER]**

I go dead quiet and slice the hook-blade down across his reaching wrist/forearm under the counter—one hard cut—then rip my coat hem free and crab-crawl backward into deeper cover. In a low whisper toward the doorway: “Patrol—he’s firing on sound; go silent and take him when he leans.”

*Agent reasoning: He’s anchoring me for the gunman’s sound-aimed shots; I need to get free quietly and stop him grabbing again, without shouting or exposing myself.*

#### Turn 95 **[GAME]**

You stop breathing. Even the coins seem to hold their shine.

Under the counter, you bring the hook-blade down once—hard, committed. The edge catches his wrist/forearm where it’s stretched and straining on your coat. There’s a wet, resistant bite; then his grip collapses.

He yelps and jerks back so fast his elbow bangs the counter leg. Blood spatters the underside of the wood and patters onto the floor in fat drops. His hand goes useless for a second, fingers flexing wrong, and he clamps his other hand over the cut, rocking on his hip with a thin, panicked moan.

Your coat hem tears with a sharp rip as you wrench free. You crab-crawl backward, slow and controlled, keeping your body flat and the hook-blade hugged close so it doesn’t scrape. You make it a full body-length deeper under the counter line—quieter cover, farther from the counter end.

At the doorway, your whisper reaches patrol. One of them answers back just as low, like they’re learning: “Copy. Quiet.”

Then the gunman does what you warned: he leans to listen.

You don’t hear his boots this time—he’s careful—but you do hear the faint brush of his sleeve on the frame. A heartbeat later, patrol’s longarm cracks from outside—one clean shot.

The round hits wood, not flesh. It punches the doorframe just above where his head would’ve been if he’d leaned another inch. The gunman snaps back out of sight instantly.

He returns fire blind—one shot into the shop, higher than before. The bullet takes a glass jar off a shelf; it explodes into sugar and shards that rain down, tinkling across the tile and into the quiet like thrown gravel.

The wounded hook-blade man is no longer grabbing you—he’s bleeding and retreating on his elbows toward the back wall, leaving a smear. But he’s still conscious, eyes wide, watching you with raw hate and fear, and his uninjured hand is feeling around for *anything* to arm himself with.

Threats now: **gunman still at the frame, trading shots with patrol and probing by sound**; **wounded man mobile and desperate, seeking a new weapon inside the shop**.

#### Turn 96 **[PLAYER]**

I whisper to Rusk, “Stay down—don’t move.” Keeping low, I inch along the counter to get a sightline on the wounded man’s hands and whatever’s within his reach, then murmur toward patrol, “If you’ve got a back entry or window, take it—he’s pinned on the frame but he’ll keep fishing for sound.”

*Agent reasoning: The gunman is using sound cues, so staying quiet and not moving into his line matters. The wounded man is still a threat if he finds a weapon; I should control him without making noise, and get eyes on the room layout before any push.*

#### Turn 97 **[GAME]**

Rusk doesn’t answer, but you feel him comply: the faint scrape of his coat stops, his breathing goes shallow. He stays a lump behind the counter—smart, terrified, quiet.

You inch along the counter on your elbows and knees, moving slow enough your clothes don’t rasp. The sugar and glass from the shattered jar crunch under your sleeve once—one tiny betray-and-regret sound—then you freeze until the room settles again.

From your new angle you catch the wounded man clearly: he’s backed against the base of a shelf near the rear wall, knees bent, boots slick with his own blood. His cut arm is pressed to his chest, but his good hand is pawing the floor and low shelf space.

Within his reach:  
- a **short wooden stool** tipped on its side (easy club)  
- a **broken jar shard** glittering near his knee (small knife)  
- the **thin metal skewer** you dropped earlier, half under a shelf edge (reachable if he stretches)  

His eyes lock on the skewer as soon as his fingers find it. He starts to snake his hand toward it, inch by inch, trying not to make noise.

At the doorway, you murmur to patrol about a back entry. A patrolman answers, tight and irritated: “No back—shop’s bricked. We got the alley only.” Another voice—different, older—adds, “Window’s barred. He’s got to come out or we go in.”

As if to prove it, the gunman at the frame taps something against the doorjamb—metal on wood, a deliberate *tick…tick*—testing how you react to sound. Then he goes still again.

Inside, the wounded man commits: he stretches for the skewer. His fingertips hook it and drag it toward him. The skewer’s tip scratches the floor with a faint, high squeal.

Immediate threats: **wounded man is about to arm himself with the skewer or a shard**, and **gunman is actively baiting and listening at the doorway; patrol has no alternate entry and is considering pushing in**.

#### Turn 98 **[PLAYER]**

I creep closer under the counter, then flick a handful of coins out toward the doorway to make a sharp, misleading jingle; as it lands, I slide out and drive the hook-blade’s flat into the wounded man’s knuckles to pin his hand and knock the skewer away. In a low hiss right in his face: “Stay down and live.”

*Agent reasoning: The wounded man re-arming is the closest, quietest threat; stopping him without drawing the gunman’s fire is priority. I need to keep noise minimal and avoid giving the gunman a sound cue.*

#### Turn 99 **[GAME]**

You creep up until the counter edge is almost touching your cheek, then snap your wrist and send a spill of coins skittering across the tile toward the doorway.

The jingle is sharp, bright—too bright in the hush.

At the frame, the gunman bites. You hear his coat brush and a quick inhale. He fires at the sound—one shot, low and fast—straight into the doorway-side floor where the coins are still spinning. The round smacks tile and throws up a spray of grit.

Patrol answers immediately. A longarm booms from outside, followed by a second shot a beat later. The second catches something—there’s a meaty *thunk* and a grunt, and the gunman stumbles back out of the doorway line. You don’t see him fall, but you hear his boots drag on wet pavement as he retreats into the rain.

Inside, you use the gunfire as cover and slide out from under the counter toward the wounded man in one smooth push.

He’s got the skewer—half in his fist now—trying to bring it up like a nail to your throat.

You slam the hook-blade’s flat down across his knuckles. Bone pops under the pressure; his fingers spill open. The skewer jumps and clatters away, spinning under the shelf where his good hand can’t reach without crawling.

He tries to snatch the broken jar shard instead, but you keep the blade’s flat pressed there—pinning, not cutting—until his hand shakes and goes slack.

Up close, his face is gray with pain and sweat, eyes glassy, jaw working like he’s chewing his own tongue. When you hiss, “Stay down and live,” he swallows hard and nods once—small, furious, but real.

Outside, patrol shouts, “He’s moving—LEFT!” Boots splash as they reposition. Someone yells, “Don’t lose him!”

Immediate threats now: **the gunman has pulled back into the rain and may try to flank or disappear**, and **patrol is shifting focus outside—meaning you and Rusk are briefly not their priority if the doorway stays quiet**. The wounded man is disarmed, but still conscious and close enough to bite, spit, or lunge.

#### Turn 100 **[PLAYER]**

I keep the hook-blade flat against his hand a moment longer, then shift to pin his forearm with my knee and yank his belt free to bind his wrists tight. “If you move, I cut,” I mutter.

Without looking up, I whisper toward Rusk, “Now—crawl to me, slow.” Then I call low toward the doorway, “PATROL—GUNMAN’S OUTSIDE LEFT; DON’T PUSH IN—ONE OF YOU COVER THIS DOOR, I’M TYING UP THE ONE INSIDE.”

*Agent reasoning: The gunman’s retreat is our biggest risk—he could circle back. I need to secure the wounded man quickly, get Rusk moving, and signal patrol not to rush in blind.*

#### Turn 101 **[GAME]**

You keep the hook-blade’s flat pressed until the wounded man’s hand stops twitching. Then you shift your weight—knee into his forearm, your shin braced against his ribs so he can’t roll.

When you yank his belt, he jerks on instinct, teeth bared. The hook-blade’s edge kisses skin just enough to remind him it isn’t a bluff. He freezes, breathing in wet little pulls.

You thread the belt around his wrists and cinch it hard. Leather bites. He grunts once—more anger than pain—then tries a twist; the belt holds. His hands are bound tight in front of him, knuckles already swelling, blood from the earlier cut slicking the strap.

“Move, I cut,” you mutter. He nods again, smaller this time, eyes down.

Behind you, Rusk finally moves. He doesn’t crawl so much as drag himself—one elbow, then the other—keeping his head low. He gets to your side, close enough that his shoulder bumps the counter base. In the dim you see his face: pale, rainwater and sweat on his lip, one hand clamped around his side like he’s trying to keep something in.

Your call to patrol changes the rhythm outside immediately.

A voice snaps back, “COPY—DOOR COVERED.” Boots slap into a new position right outside the threshold, and you hear the scrape of a longarm settling onto the doorframe for a steadier angle.

Another patrolman yells farther left, “I got movement—by the alley mouth!” A shot cracks, then another. Not the controlled boom from earlier—these are hurried.

Then: a hard metallic *clack* and the ugly whine of a ricochet off brick. Someone outside curses, high and scared. “He’s got cover—can’t see—”

The threat becomes clear in the next second: something small and hard skitters into the shop through the doorway and rolls across the tile, ticking as it spins—coming to rest near the coins you threw earlier.

It’s a palm-sized cylinder with a fuse spitting bright, angry sparks.

Rusk’s eyes go wide. He sucks in breath to shout but it catches in his throat.

You have maybe a heartbeat or two before it goes off—right there on the shop floor between you and the door.

#### Turn 102 **[PLAYER]**

I shove Rusk flat and haul him behind the thickest part of the counter, throwing my body over him, head down and mouth open. “GRENADE IN—GET BACK!” I bark toward the doorway, then clamp my hands over the back of my neck and brace for the blast.

*Agent reasoning: That’s a thrown explosive—no time to be clever. Best odds are to get behind solid cover and protect Rusk from shrapnel; don’t run toward the door. I’ll also warn patrol so they don’t step in or get caught by the blast.*

#### Turn 103 **[GAME]**

You flatten Rusk and drag him behind the counter’s thick corner—where the wood’s doubled and the shelving braces it—then throw your body over him. Your shout hits the doorway like a slap.

Outside, someone yells, “BACK—BACK!” Boots skid on rain-slick tile at the threshold as the door-cover man jerks away from the frame.

The cylinder pops with a sharp *crack*—not a deep military thump, more like a brutal firework—then detonates.

The blast doesn’t tear the shop apart; it *shreds* the front half of it. A wave of glass and tile grit slams into the counter face like thrown gravel. The counter shudders and the impact hammers your ribs. Your ears go instantly dull, replaced by a high, steady whine.

Splinters bite into your coat and the back of your neck. Something hot stings your left shoulder—surface burn, not deep. Rusk convulses under you, a strangled sound trapped in his chest, but he’s still moving.

The doorway becomes a white, smoking rectangle for a second. Then the smoke thins enough to show the floor: peppered with bright metal flecks. That’s when the pain arrives—dozens of tiny cuts along your forearms and cheek where you weren’t fully covered.

Outside, a patrolman screams—full-throated—and collapses out of view with a wet slap, hit by shrapnel. Another voice shouts, “MEDIC—MEDIC!” and someone fires twice into the rain, blind and angry.

Behind you, the wounded man you tied up lets out a hoarse laugh that turns into coughing. He’s alive—but the blast has rolled him onto his side, belt still cinched, and he’s wriggling, trying to get his bound hands under him to crawl.

New, immediate threat: through the thinning smoke at the doorway, a dark shape cuts across the opening—fast, low—using the chaos to reposition. Not inside yet, but close enough that the next move could be a rush or another thrown device.

Rusk’s voice finally breaks through the ringing, thin and panicked: “Lena—my side— I—” His hand is slick when it brushes your sleeve. Blood.

#### Turn 104 **[PLAYER]**

I hook a boot over the bound man’s belt and shove him back against the shelf base, then press the hook-blade to his throat. “One more wriggle and you bleed out faster,” I hiss.  

I turn to Rusk, keep my voice low. “Show me—where’s it hit?” I yank a strip from my shirt hem and clamp it hard to his side.  

Toward the doorway, barely above a whisper: “Patrol—don’t fire blind. He’ll rush on the noise. If you’ve got a shield, bring it; otherwise hold and listen.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re pinned and the gunman may rush; Rusk is bleeding and needs to stay quiet and alive. I should secure the tied man so he can’t crawl, then get Rusk’s bleeding under control and coordinate with patrol without exposing us.*

#### Turn 105 **[GAME]**

Your boot hooks the belt binding his wrists and you shove. The bound man slides on grit and broken glass until his shoulder thumps the shelf base. He tries to curl away, but there’s nowhere to go; the shelving pins him in place.

You lay the hook-blade to the soft notch under his jaw. Not cutting—just enough pressure that he feels the edge find skin. His throat works. He goes still, breathing through his nose, eyes locked on you with a mix of hate and calculation. No more wriggling.

Rusk fumbles his coat open with shaking fingers and pulls your hand to the right side of his belly, just above the beltline. There’s a shrapnel cut—ragged and ugly, bleeding steady rather than spurting. When you rip a strip from your shirt hem and clamp down, the blood soaks it almost immediately, but the pressure slows it to a thick ooze. Rusk grits his teeth and nods, trying not to make a sound.

At the doorway, your whisper carries. A patrolman answers low, voice tight: “No shield. We’ve got one man down—bleeding bad.” Another one says, “Copy: holding.”

Then something changes outside: not gunfire—*quiet*. Footsteps stop splashing. The rain noise feels suddenly louder because the street goes still.

A faint, almost musical *ting* rides the air from just beyond the threshold—like a wire under tension being tapped.

And then, from the downspout just outside the door, a short metallic cough: *pfft-CHUNK*.

A capsule bursts at ankle height, flashing white through the smoke-haze and spitting a fan of wet dye across the doorway and floor. Blue, unnaturally clean—like neon paint in rain. Droplets pepper the tile and the lower edge of the counter, and a spray catches your trouser leg and the side of your coat.

The patrolman at the door swears, “What the hell—? My boots—” He staggers back, tracking blue footprints.

Outside, a voice you don’t recognize calls, calm and close: “Marked.”

The threat is immediate and specific now: **someone has set a tripwire dye/flash device at the doorway** and you’ve been splashed—making you trackable in the rain and giving whoever’s outside a confirmation that you’re still in here. The bound man’s eyes flick to the blue on your leg, and he smiles despite the blade at his throat.

#### Turn 106 **[PLAYER]**

I press the blade a hair firmer under the bound man’s jaw. “Tell your friend outside what comes next if he steps in—now.”

To Rusk, low: “Keep pressure. Don’t look at the door.” I grab a wet rag or towel from under the counter and scrub at the blue on my coat and trouser leg, then smear the rag across the floor in a messy fan to muddy any clean track.

Toward patrol, tight whisper: “We’re marked with dye—watch for tripwires. Is there any other way out—roof hatch, back hall, even a crawlspace? Don’t answer loud; just tap twice if yes.”

*Agent reasoning: We’ve been marked, so staying put makes us easier to track; I need to reduce the dye, keep Rusk from bleeding out, and use the captive as leverage while confirming exits/traps before moving.*

#### Turn 107 **[GAME]**

You press the hook-blade tighter. A bead of blood wells where the edge dimples his skin.

The bound man swallows hard, throat scraping the steel. He forces his voice up, loud enough to carry but rough with pain: “DON’T COME IN. SHE’S GOT ME. SHE’LL—” He breaks into a cough, then tries again, “She’ll open my throat. She’s—she’s got a cop bleeding behind the counter.”

Outside, the calm voice answers immediately, closer than before, like he’s just off to the side of the doorway: “He’s not your leverage.”

A second voice—different, younger—mutters, “We got the mark. That’s enough.”

Rusk nods at your instruction and keeps pressure on his own wound with both hands, eyes squeezed shut, breathing shallow. He doesn’t look at the door. His knuckles are going white around the cloth.

You reach under the counter. Your fingers find a bar towel—still damp, sour with old dishwater—and you scrub at the blue on your coat and trouser leg. It smears, lightening in places but staining into the fabric’s weave. The rag turns vivid cobalt.

You drag that rag across the tile in a wide, ugly fan. The clean, obvious footprints become a chaotic wash of blue and gray grit—harder to read at a glance, but now there’s *more* dyed surface area, and it glints wetly in the doorway light.

At your whisper to patrol, there’s a pause. Then, from somewhere just outside and to the right, you hear two quick, deliberate taps—metal on metal, like a flashlight ring against a railing. *Tap-tap.*

A patrolman’s voice follows, barely audible: “Back hall. Storage door. Locked.”

Before you can process it, the calm voice outside says, conversational: “They’re asking about exits.”

That lands like a punch: **someone outside is close enough to hear your whispers clearly**—either right at the threshold or with a listening tube/mic against the wall.

Then you hear it: a soft scrape against the exterior brick to the left of the doorway, followed by a thin, descending whine—something being fed down.

A small object drops into view at the top of the doorway and dangles on a line, swinging gently in the smoky air: a glass bulb the size of a plum, filled with pale fluid.

Threat, immediate: **they’re lowering a second device into the doorway on a line, positioning it to burst inside without stepping in.**

#### Turn 108 **[PLAYER]**

I jerk the bound man’s collar up and shove him toward the doorway as a shield, blade at his throat. “Pull that bulb back or he dies—now.”

To Rusk, tight and low: “On me. We’re moving to the back hall—slow, keep that pressure.” I half-drag him along the counter line toward the storage door, eyes flicking up to track the hanging bulb for any drip or swing that means it’s about to burst.

Without words to patrol, I tap twice on the counter edge in answer, then point hard toward the back with two fingers—move, not shoot.

*Agent reasoning: They can hear whispers and are lowering a device to gas us out; staying by the door is suicide. Best move is immediate relocation to the back hall while we still can, and use the hostage to buy seconds. Need to warn patrol without giving details and keep Rusk moving.*

#### Turn 110 **[PLAYER]**

I haul the bound man up by his collar and shove him toward the doorway as cover, hook-blade tight under his jaw. “Pull the bulb back or he dies—now.”

I keep Rusk tucked behind the counter line and half-drag him toward the back hall, murmuring, “On me—slow—keep pressure.” I watch the hanging bulb for any sudden stop, drip, or twitch that means it’s about to pop.

I tap twice on the counter edge to answer patrol, then jab two fingers hard toward the back—move, don’t shoot.

*Agent reasoning: The bulb-on-a-line is an immediate hazard and the outside voice can hear whispers, so I need to reduce exposure at the doorway and get to the back hall without provoking blind gunfire. Using the bound man as a moving shield is ugly but practical, and I need to communicate silently to patrol while keeping Rusk mobile and low.*

#### Turn 111 **[GAME]**

You wrench the bound man upright by his collar. The belt bites into his wrists; he yelps and stumbles as you drive him toward the doorway with the hook-blade hard under his jaw. His feet skid through the smeared dye on the tile, leaving a darker, muddier trail.

“Pull it back,” you snap. “Or he dies—now.”

For half a second, the bulb on the line stops swinging.

Then the calm voice answers from just outside the frame of the door, flat as a ledger: “Do it.”

The line jerks—not up, but *down and in*. The bulb drops fast into the doorway space, right at the bound man’s chest level.

You see it clearly: the glass has a scored seam around its middle. No drip—just a hairline glint as it twists.

It *pops* with a wet crack.

A pale mist punches outward and clings low, like it’s heavier than air. It washes over the bound man first—his mouth opens to scream but turns into a strangled gag. His eyes slam shut; his knees buckle. The vapor rolls inward along the floor, crawling under the counter lip.

Immediate threat: **chemical irritant/knockdown gas in the doorway, spreading into the shop. Breathing and vision are about to get worse by the second.**

You keep Rusk tucked behind the counter and haul him toward the back hall. He moves, but the first breath of it catches him—he coughs hard, a wet bark that shakes his whole frame. Blood seeps through his makeshift bandage again as his hands reflexively loosen, then clamp back down.

At the front, your two taps on the counter get answered—boots scrape. One patrolman appears at the edge of the doorway, then recoils as the mist hits his shins. He jerks back, swearing, “Gas—!”

Another voice—young—barks, “Don’t go in. Let it work.”

The bound man, still in your grip, goes suddenly heavy. His legs fold. If you keep him up as a shield, you’re now holding a semi-conscious, choking weight in the worst of the vapor.

From outside, you hear a second line being handled—something else being readied—while the mist continues to spread inward toward your route to the back hall.

#### Turn 112 **[PLAYER]**

I let the bound man crumple between the doorway and the counter to act as a stumbling block, then yank my sleeve over my mouth and nose and wave Rusk to keep his face high. 

I grab anything heavy behind the counter (a stool, crate, or small shelf unit) and shove it down low toward the doorway to slow the crawling mist, then half-drag Rusk into the back hall and shoulder the storage door. “Locked how—padlock or knob?” I rasp, scanning for a key hook, bolt cutters, or something to pry it.

*Agent reasoning: The gas is low and spreading; I need cleaner air and an exit fast. Keeping the hostage now is a liability and keeps me in the worst of the mist. I should get Rusk higher/away, block the gas path, and push for the locked back door without exposing us to the doorway.*

#### Turn 113 **[GAME]**

You let the bound man go. He folds in a wet heap right where the doorway narrows—half in the threshold, half inside—arms pinned under him. His boots kick once, then scrape uselessly as the mist keeps eating at his lungs.

You haul your sleeve over your mouth and nose. It helps with the sting, not the burn. Your eyes water immediately; the blue smear on your cuff turns slick against your lips. You motion Rusk’s head up—he tries, but every breath makes him cough. He’s fighting to stay quiet and failing.

Behind the counter you find a squat wooden stool and a low crate of bottled sarsaparilla. You shove both down toward the doorway, scraping them hard across tile. The crate hits the bound man’s shoulder with a dull thump and wedges against him and the doorframe.

It doesn’t “stop” the mist, but it **forces it to pool and curl** around the obstruction instead of streaming straight in. The densest layer stays nearer the floor at the front for a few extra heartbeats—enough to move.

You half-drag Rusk into the back hall. The hall is narrow, stacked with sacks and a mop bucket; the air back here is clearer but still stings as the vapor creeps in low.

You shoulder the storage door. Solid. No give.

Rusk, voice shredded, points with a trembling finger: “Knob… deadbolt… inside key.” He coughs again, and you hear the metal rattle of the lockset when his shoulder bumps it—**it’s a keyed deadbolt, not a padlock.**

To the right of the doorframe is a short row of hooks—mostly empty. One hook holds a single key ring with two keys and a stamped brass tag: **“STOR.”**

As you reach, something hits the front windows—*tap tap tap*—small, fast impacts like gravel. Then a sharper crack: someone outside is striking the glass with a tool, testing for a weak point, timing it with the gas.

Threat now: **forced entry from the front within seconds to a minute, while the gas continues creeping down the hall at floor level.**

#### Turn 114 **[PLAYER]**

I snatch the “STOR” key ring and jam the first key into the deadbolt, trying to turn it quick but controlled. “Rusk—stay up, breathe high. If I go down, you crawl through and keep going.”

If the bolt gives, I pull the door open just enough to slip Rusk through first, then glance back down the hall for anything I can kick over (mop bucket, sacks) to slow the low-lying gas before I follow and shut the door behind us.

*Agent reasoning: We’re running out of time—gas is creeping in and they’re about to breach the front. Best move is get through the storage door fast, then put barriers between us and the hall while keeping Rusk upright and moving.*

#### Turn 115 **[GAME]**

The first key bites the deadbolt but doesn’t turn—wrong cut. Your fingers are slick; the metal feels like ice.

Behind you, down the hall, the gas reaches the baseboards in a thin, crawling layer. It doesn’t rush; it *seeks*. It eddies around the mop bucket and the stacked sacks, then keeps coming.

Rusk tries to keep his face high like you said, but another cough doubles him. He braces a hand on the wall and smears something dark—blood from his palm or his side, you can’t tell which in the dim.

You swap keys. The second key slides in clean.

The bolt gives with a hard, dry *clack*.

You pull the door open only a handspan. Cold, stale air spills out—storage air: dust, old cardboard, and something like pickling brine. You shove Rusk through first. He has to turn sideways, shoulder scraping the jamb; he bites down on a sound, then stumbles inside and catches himself on a shelf.

From the shop end comes a decisive *crack*—glass giving way. A voice calls, closer now, filtered and tight like someone has cloth over their mouth: “Back hall! Move!”

You glance down and kick the mop bucket over. Gray water slaps across the floor and runs into the low-lying vapor, making it curl and break into thinner tendrils for a moment. You ram your boot into the nearest sack pile; it slumps, spilling something granular that skitters under the gas like grit.

It buys you seconds, not safety.

You slip through after Rusk and pull the door shut. The latch catches. The deadbolt is still thrown open unless you turn it again.

On the other side of the door, you hear boots in the hall and a wet, dragging scrape—someone stepping around the fallen bucket. A hand hits the storage door once, testing, then another voice: “Locked. Find the other way—”

And then a softer, more worrying sound: metal on metal at the knob, like someone producing picks or a slim tool and deciding to take their time.

Inside the storage room, it’s tight aisles and high shelves. No obvious exit in the first glance—just stacked crates, a meat-hook rail, and a small, grimy window set too high to reach without climbing.

#### Turn 116 **[PLAYER]**

I spin back to the door and throw the deadbolt, then press my ear to it for half a beat to gauge how close they are. “Rusk—get low behind the shelves, keep your face up; don’t let them hear you.” I drag a crate or shelf unit to stack under the high window and start climbing to test if it opens or can be kicked out quietly.

*Agent reasoning: They’re already working the lock; buying time matters. Securing the deadbolt and finding an alternate exit (window/vent) is safer than fighting in a cramped aisle. I also need to keep Rusk upright and quiet.*

#### Turn 117 **[GAME]**

You twist the key and throw the deadbolt home. The bolt slides with a thick, final *thunk* that you feel through the door.

You put your ear to the wood.

On the other side: two sets of boots in the hall, close—right outside. One man’s breathing is loud and wet behind cloth. You hear a quick, irritated whisper: “She bolted it.”

A thin metal rasp touches the knob again—testing. Then a sharper tap-tap at the lock, like someone seating a pick and realizing the deadbolt isn’t going to politely cooperate.

A third voice, farther back toward the shop, calls: “Window! Check the back window—now!”

Rusk nods at your order, pale and sweating. He ducks behind the nearest shelving, trying to keep his head above the lowest haze that’s beginning to seep under the door in a faint, stinging ribbon. He clamps a hand over his mouth to smother the coughs, and you hear them anyway—muffled, ragged.

You grab a wooden crate and drag it under the high window. It screeches across the floor—loud in the tight room. Immediately, the men outside go quiet for half a second, listening.

Then: a knuckle-rap on the door, deliberate. “Miss Marrow,” a voice says—calm, practiced. “Open up. You’re making this worse.”

You climb onto the crate and reach the window. It’s a grimy, fixed sash with a simple latch… and a nailed-down stop. Someone’s made sure it doesn’t open more than a finger’s width. You can force it, but not quietly.

You test it again, harder. The wood flexes and gives a tiny squeal.

Outside—close now, on the other side of that wall—you hear movement, like someone positioning under the window line. A shadow passes across the filthy glass, blocking what little light there is.

Back at the door, the lock work stops. You hear metal being set down, then a different sound: the scrape of something heavy being lifted into position.

Threat: they’re about to **breach the storage door by force** (ram or shoulder), and someone has moved to **cover the window** from outside, ready to grab or strike if you break it.

#### Turn 118 **[PLAYER]**

I drop off the crate and whisper to Rusk, “Stay still—no noise. If they come in, don’t shoot unless I say.” 

I scan the shelves fast for a back door, cellar hatch, or service crawlspace, and if I spot none, I drag a heavy shelf sideways to create a choke point facing the storage door, then take a low position off to the hinge side with my blade ready—out of the direct line of the breach. “You know my name,” I call softly at the door. “Then you know I don’t open for men who gas a room. What do you want?”

*Agent reasoning: The window’s covered and booby-stopped, so forcing it is a trap. The door breach is imminent; I need a position of advantage, a distraction, and a quieter escape route if one exists. I’ll check for an interior back exit while setting an ambush angle and keeping Rusk hidden and breathing high.*

#### Turn 119 **[GAME]**

Rusk nods once, tight and miserable, and wedges himself deeper behind the shelves. He keeps his pistol down but his knuckles are white on the grip. The gas under the door is still only a thin, floor-hugging ribbon in here, but it’s enough to make his eyes shine and his breathing hitch.

You sweep the storage room fast: stacked crates, a rail of hooks, a narrow aisle to a back wall of damp brick. No back door. No hatch. No obvious crawlspace—just a floor drain and a patch of newer mortar where someone’s repaired the wall. The high window is the only light and it’s controlled from outside.

You put your shoulder into a heavy shelving unit and drag it sideways. It scrapes loud, metal feet chattering on concrete. You angle it so anyone coming through the storage door has to funnel around the shelf edge. You drop low on the hinge side, hook-blade ready, out of the straight line where a rush or a gun would naturally point.

At the door, you hear the heavy thing settle—wood on concrete—then a grunt as they adjust their grip.

You call out.

A beat. Then the calm voice answers, closer to the door than before, still muffled like he’s speaking through cloth: “We want the officer. That’s all.”

Another voice—impatient, rougher—cuts in: “And the notebook, if you’ve got it.”

The calm one continues, as if correcting a subordinate without saying so: “You walked into a bad room, Marrow. You can walk out. Slide him out and we’ll leave you breathing.”

You hear a quick, urgent whisper between them, right outside: “Hinge side. She’s smart.”

Then the breach starts—not a full ram yet, but a test hit: *WHAM* into the door, hard enough to make the deadbolt plate groan and the door shudder in its frame. Dust shakes off the top shelf. Rusk flinches and clamps his mouth shut to keep from coughing.

Threat is immediate and specific: they’re escalating to **forced entry** through the storage door; if the bolt or frame fails, they’ll come through fast and low, and they’ve stated their target is **Rusk** (and possibly your notebook/patterns).

#### Turn 120 **[PLAYER]**

“Officer’s not for sale,” I call, steady, buying breath. “And you’re not getting my book—so tell me who you work for before you start breaking bones.”

I motion Rusk to stay put, then creep to the patch of newer mortar and press along it with my fingertips and the hook-blade tip, probing for a seam, hollow, or loose brick—something that gives. With my free hand I quietly drag a crate into the funnel gap by the door so the first man through has to trip or climb, and I settle back low on the hinge side, blade ready for the moment the frame gives.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to breach; I need time and another exit. The patched mortar might hide a crawl or weak point, and talking can stall while I set a trap at the door’s funnel.*

#### Turn 121 **[GAME]**

Your words land on the other side of the door and get answered with a short, humorless exhale.

“Not for sale,” the calm voice repeats, like he’s tasting it. “That’s cute.”

The rougher one doesn’t bother with talk. You hear him shift his stance—boots scuffing for traction—then the real hit comes.

*WHAM.*

The door bucks in its frame. The deadbolt holds, but the strike plate screams; a splinter pops somewhere near the jamb. The shelving you dragged shivers, metal rattling against glass jars.

You motion Rusk down again; he stays put, eyes wide, trying to swallow his coughs.

You slide to the newer mortar patch. Up close it’s not just “fresh”—it’s sloppy, like a rush job: mortar smeared a little over brick faces, sandier than the older work. You probe with the hook-blade tip.

On the third press, the tip sinks a hair too easily. Not brick—void. You scrape gently and a thin line of mortar flakes away, revealing the edge of something set into the wall: a narrow iron panel, about the width of a ledger book, mortared over to disappear. There’s a faint seam at the bottom.

It’s not opening on its own, but it’s *real*—a service access or old chute cover someone didn’t want found.

You drag a crate into the funnel by the door. “Quietly” isn’t in the cards: it grinds and thumps once as it catches on the floor drain. Still, it sits where you want it—first step inside becomes a stumble or a climb.

Outside, the calm voice stops negotiating. “On three,” he says, low.

You hear them reposition—one man close to the latch side, another farther back with the ram. Then:

“One.”

Gas continues to feather under the door, thicker now; it curls around the crate legs and starts pooling in the lowest aisle.

“Two.”

Rusk’s breathing turns sharp and panicked behind the shelves.

“Th—”

The ram hits before “three” finishes.

*WHAM—CRACK.*

The doorframe gives a little this time. The deadbolt is still in, but the wood around the strike plate splits enough to show a bright, raw line. One more like that and the bolt may tear free with the frame.

Immediate threat: **breach is imminent**; if they get the door open, the first man through will be funneled into your crate-and-shelf choke point, but they’re coming fast and armed, and the gas is now **building inside** the room.

#### Turn 122 **[PLAYER]**

I hiss to Rusk, “Up high—on the shelves if you can. Don’t breathe low,” then jam the hook-blade into the seam of the iron panel and pry hard, using a crate as leverage under my boot. If it cracks open, I shove it wide enough to get fingers in and pull, then wave Rusk over: “Here—move, now,” keeping my body between him and the door as the next hit comes.

*Agent reasoning: The door’s about to fail and the gas is rising; fighting two armed men in a confined room is a bad bet. The iron access panel is the only new escape route—worth forcing immediately while the choke point buys seconds.*

#### Turn 123 **[GAME]**

Rusk nods hard, coughing once despite himself, and hauls himself up onto the lower shelf rung. He gets his face higher, away from the worst of the floor-hugging gas, boots scraping metal. He keeps the pistol, but he’s trying to make himself small.

You drive the hook-blade into the iron panel’s bottom seam. It bites with a metallic *tink* and skates—paint and mortar dust—then catches. You brace a boot on the crate edge and pry.

The seam gives with a brittle crack as the mortar lip fractures. Your shoulder and forearm burn; the panel flexes a fraction, then pops inward with a dull *clunk* like a latch finally surrendering.

At the door:

*WHAM.*

The frame splinters again. The deadbolt is still engaged, but the strike-side wood is now chewed open; you can see a sliver of the bolt through the torn jamb. They’re one solid hit from ripping it free.

You wrench the panel wider. It opens like a narrow service hatch, swinging inward on stiff hinges. A breath of colder air spills out—damp, old-stone cold—and with it the stink of stagnant water and rust.

Inside is not a clean passage. It’s a vertical drop of about three feet into a tight brick-lined service run—wide enough for a person turned sideways—leading off into darkness. You can hear water somewhere below, slow dripping, and the faint tremor of traffic through the masonry.

You get your fingers in and pull it as wide as it will go. The opening is just barely man-sized, and the lower edge is sharp with broken mortar.

You wave Rusk over. He starts to climb down from the shelf, moving too fast, panic in him now.

Then the calm voice outside calls, sharp: “She found the panel—window side! Shoot the hinges if it opens!”

A shadow crosses the high window again, and something metallic taps the glass from outside—someone lining up.

The next hit comes immediately.

*WHAM—SNAP.*

The deadbolt tears partway through the softened wood. The door doesn’t fly open yet, but it lurches inward an inch, held by the remaining splinters and the warped bolt. Through the gap you see oilskin knees and the dull black nose of a pistol probing for angle.

Threat, clear: in seconds they can force the door fully; there’s a gun already fishing through the gap, and someone outside is ready to fire toward the hatch/window side if they get a sightline. The hatch is open, but it’s a cramped, sharp-edged drop into a dark service run—easy to snag, easy to get stuck if you rush.

#### Turn 124 **[PLAYER]**

“Rusk—down the hatch, now. Head low, gun away, don’t snag.”  

I slap the hatch edge to guide him, then hiss toward the door, “He’s not here—check the window!” As the pistol noses in, I kick the crate into the door’s gap to jam their entry and spoil their angle, then duck through the hatch after Rusk, pulling the iron panel as closed as I can from the inside.

*Agent reasoning: They’re seconds from bursting in and already probing with a gun; the hatch is our only exit. I need Rusk moving first while I block sightlines and buy a heartbeat with misdirection, then follow immediately—no heroics, just survive.*

#### Turn 125 **[GAME]**

Rusk doesn’t argue. He shoves the pistol into his waistband like it burns him, turns sideways, and drops into the service run feet-first. His shoulder catches the broken mortar edge; fabric tears with a sharp rip and he hisses through his teeth, but he keeps moving, hunched, head low like you ordered. He lands awkwardly in shallow, slick water—ankle-deep—and stumbles forward to make room.

You slap the hatch edge, then throw your lie at the door: “He’s not here—check the window!”

Outside, the calm voice snaps, “Don’t—” but the rougher one is already committed. The pistol noses through the gap, searching.

You kick the crate.

It slams into the door’s inch-wide opening and wedges hard against the warped bolt and splintered jamb. The pistol jerks back as the crate bites. For a heartbeat the choke holds—wood grinding on wood, the door stuck half-chewed open but not advancing.

“Shit—she jammed it!” the rough voice barks.

You duck into the hatch after Rusk. The drop scrapes your shins; the brick is wet and greasy. Your boots hit water with a cold slap. The air down here is worse in a different way—mold, iron, old urine, and something chemical that makes your throat sting.

Behind you, you haul the iron panel toward closed. It swings most of the way, but the broken mortar lip keeps it from seating flush. You get it nearly shut—enough that from the storage room it looks like a dark seam again.

Then the shot comes.

Not from the door—too jammed for a clean angle—but from above: the high window. Glass pops and rains down in tinkling shards onto the storage floor. A second shot follows, *clang*ing off something metal inside the room.

The calm voice: “Find the hatch. Now.”

You hear the crate being dragged, then kicked free; the door finally groans wider as they muscle past the jam. Boots thud into the storage room. A flashlight beam sweeps, briefly knifing through the hatch seam—close enough that a thin line of light cuts into the service run.

Rusk is already moving in the dark, one hand on the wall, trying not to splash. He whispers, ragged: “Which way—?”

Threat is immediate: two armed men are **in the storage room** and actively **searching for the hatch**, with at least one shooter positioned at the **window**. You’ve gained a few seconds, not safety, and the service run is narrow, wet, and echoing—noise will carry.

#### Turn 126 **[PLAYER]**

I grab Rusk’s sleeve and whisper, “Wait—listen.” I hold still for a beat, feeling for any draft or hearing street noise, then point the way that seems to carry airflow and guide him forward with a hand on the wall. As we move, I keep my steps tight and slow to avoid splashing, blade in my right hand, and I murmur, “If they crack that hatch, kill your breath and don’t run—just freeze.”

*Agent reasoning: We need distance fast, but quietly; sound carries and they’ve got a flashlight line on the seam. I’ll choose the direction that feels like it leads to airflow/exit, minimize splashing, and be ready to misdirect if they open the panel.*

#### Turn 127 **[GAME]**

You clamp a hand on Rusk’s sleeve and both of you go statue-still in the brick slit. The water around your boots settles from ripples to a faint tremble.

Above and behind, the storage room is a muffled storm: a shelf scrapes, a jar breaks, a man swears under his breath. A flashlight beam skates across the hatch seam again—brighter this time, steadier—then disappears.

You tilt your head, hunting for something honest: a draft, street noise, anything that tells you which way isn’t a dead end. On your left, the air is stale and warmer, the stink of rot stronger. On your right, there’s a thin, colder pull across your cheek—faint but real—and with it a far-off, metallic hum like a transformer or a streetlamp ballast. You point right.

You guide Rusk forward, one hand on the wall, moving tight and slow. Each step is a careful roll of the foot to keep the water from slapping. Even so, Rusk’s boot clips something submerged—tin or glass—and it gives a small, traitorous *clink*.

Up above, instantly: “Hold up,” the calm voice says. “You hear that? Down in the wall.”

A pause. The kind where men decide whether they’re imagining things.

Then: a hard knock on brick, close to the hatch—someone rapping the wall with the butt of a tool, listening for hollow. Another knock, closer to where the panel is mortared over.

“Here,” the rough voice says. “This patch—fresh.”

Metal grinds against masonry: they’ve got something—crowbar or chisel—worrying at the mortar from the storage-room side.

You keep moving. The cold draft strengthens as the run bends slightly; the brick under your left hand changes—slicker, with a strip of old mortar like a repair line. Ahead, the passage tightens for a few feet, then you see a darker vertical seam: a junction where the run meets an older conduit, narrower but drier.

Behind you, a sharp *crack*—mortar breaking free. The iron panel doesn’t open yet, but it shifts with a dull, transmitted vibration through the bricks you’re touching.

Rusk’s breathing goes shallow as you murmur your instruction. He nods once, eyes wide in the dark.

Threat is now specific and closing: they’ve identified the fresh patch and are actively prying the hatch open. If the panel swings, their flashlight will rake the run and they’ll have a straight line for a shot into this narrow corridor.

I tug Rusk toward the darker seam. “Into the narrow—now. Sideways.”  

Once he’s through, I slip in after him and ease the blade out to score the wet brick at the junction—just enough to loosen grit and make a slick patch—then we press flat and still just inside the tighter conduit, lights off, listening for the hatch to swing.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to pop the hatch and this corridor becomes a shooting lane. Better to break line-of-sight and get into the narrower, drier conduit; if we must, set a quiet ambush at the choke rather than run splashing.*

#### Turn 129 **[GAME]**

Rusk squeezes into the narrower conduit sideways, shoulders scraping brick. It’s drier in there—no ankle-water—but the air is tighter, dustier, with that old-stone taste that coats the back of your tongue. He shuffles two steps in and presses himself flat against the right wall, making a gap for you.

You slip in after him, turning your hips to clear. Your coat drags grit off the brick with a soft rasp. At the junction, you take the hook-blade and score the wet brick where the two passages meet—shallow cuts, just enough to crumble the softened mortar skin. The surface turns to slick paste under the blade, gritty mud that smears and drops in clumps onto the floor where the run narrows.

You and Rusk go still, flattened just inside the tighter conduit.

Behind you, the hatch finally gives.

A scrape—metal on brick—then a harsher sound as the iron panel is forced inward. Cold air rushes through the opened seam like a sigh. A flashlight snaps on and a hard white beam stabs into the service run, sweeping low.

“Down here,” the rough voice says, close now, echoing. “I got a hole.”

Bootsteps splash into the run—one man commits. You hear him testing footing, then moving fast, thinking you ran.

The slick patch does what you meant it to. His next step hits your freshly loosened grit at the junction; his boot skates. He catches himself with a palm slap on the wall, but his knee bangs the brick with a hollow *thunk* and he swears, loud.

“Careful—” the calm voice calls from above, and the beam wobbles.

The slip buys you a half-second, not a disappearance. The man in the run recovers and pushes forward anyway, now slower, flashlight angling toward the junction—toward the darker seam you used.

The light begins to creep across the junction line. If it swings another foot, it’ll rake into the narrow conduit and paint you and Rusk flat against the wall.

Rusk’s breath stops on its own, eyes locked on the oncoming glow. Your blade is in your right hand; there’s barely room to swing in this conduit, and no room to pass each other.

Threat, immediate: an armed searcher is advancing in the service run with a flashlight and likely a pistol; he’s about to clear the junction and get a direct sightline into your hiding place.

#### Turn 130 **[PLAYER]**

I press my lips to Rusk’s ear: “On my touch—back up, slow. No noise.”  

As the flashlight edge creeps toward the seam, I flick my hook-blade out low and slap-swipe at the beam hand from the dark—aiming to knock the light into the wet run—then immediately pull back and shuffle deeper into the narrow conduit, keeping my shoulder to the wall and dragging Rusk with me.

*Agent reasoning: If the beam hits us, it’s over. I can’t fight cleanly in this tight space, so I need to steal his light and balance at the junction, then vanish deeper while he’s disoriented.*

#### Turn 131 **[GAME]**

Rusk gives the tiniest nod you can feel through his coat. He starts to edge backward, careful, heel-to-toe in the dry grit.

The flashlight’s glow thickens at the junction seam—then your hook-blade snakes out low from the dark.

You connect.

Steel clips knuckles instead of the lamp body. The man yelps—sharp, involuntary—and the flashlight jerks. It bounces off the brick lip and drops into the wet run with a loud *clack-splash*, beam spinning wild across water and wall like a lighthouse gone mad.

But you paid for it: the hook-blade bites skin. Not deep, but enough to draw. You feel the blade snag for a fraction of a second on something—glove seam or a ring—before you rip it back.

“CONTACT!” the man shouts, voice cracking with pain and adrenaline. His other hand comes up fast; you hear the unmistakable rasp of a pistol clearing leather.

A shot detonates in the tight space. The muzzle flash blooms against brick; the crack punches your ears flat. The round smacks the junction edge—brick chips sting your cheek—and the ricochet whines down the run.

Above, the calm voice is suddenly all command: “Light’s down—DON’T FIRE BLIND—” too late. “Get in there. Now.”

Boots hit the run behind him: a second man drops in, splashing hard, moving on the sound. The fallen flashlight continues to spin in the water, beam strobing the junction every half-turn—brief, brutal flashes that threaten to catch your outline.

You yank back into the narrow conduit, shoulder scraping, dragging Rusk by the sleeve. He backsteps as instructed, but he can’t help a small grunt as his hip catches a brick nub.

The injured man at the junction slaps a hand against the wall, feeling for your seam. “Right here—she’s in the side cut!” He’s close enough now that his fingers rake the edge of the conduit mouth.

Immediate threat: one armed man is at the junction, pistol up, reaching into your entrance; a second is rushing up the wet run behind him. The dropped flashlight is intermittently lighting the conduit mouth, and another blind shot in this brick throat could hit you or Rusk even without a clear sightline.

#### Turn 132 **[PLAYER]**

I grab Rusk’s collar and haul him deeper, whispering, “Move—no talking.” As the flashlight beam swings away, I shove a loose brick/stone from the conduit edge down into the junction and smear more slick grit at the lip, then retreat fast but controlled, keeping my blade up and my body between Rusk and the entrance. “If he comes in, you crawl past me—don’t stand.”

*Agent reasoning: They’ve got the entrance and a pistol; fighting in this tube is suicide. Best move is to break their line of sight, slow them, and get distance—quietly—before they commit further. Use the strobing light against them and leave a nasty surprise at the mouth.*

#### Turn 133 **[GAME]**

You fist Rusk by the collar and haul him another yard down the narrow conduit. He stumbles, catches himself on the wall, and goes low the way you told him—hands and knees, breath held.

The flashlight in the wet run keeps spinning. When its beam swings away, you dart back to the mouth. The conduit edge has a half-loosened brick—more a broken chunk than a clean brick. You wrench it free with a muted grind and shove it down into the junction.

It hits the slick, wet lip you already ruined and skitters instead of wedging—clacks the wall, drops into the ankle-water with a splash, and floats the flashlight beam for a second as it bumps the light. The beam stutters, then continues its slow, nauseating spin.

You smear more loosened grit at the lip anyway, making the entry a treacherous little ramp.

At the junction, the armed man’s fingers find air where the brick used to be. He curses and jabs his pistol toward the conduit mouth, not quite committing his head and shoulders yet. “She’s right—”

His boot steps to follow his hand.

The slick takes him harder this time. His foot slides out; his shin slams the brick edge with a sharp crack and he goes down on one knee in the water, catching himself on the wall. The pistol discharges as he falls—another deafening blast. The round punches into the conduit mouth and chips brick inches from where your hand just was. Dust puffs into your face; a hot sting grazes your knuckles.

“Christ—!” he snarls, now angry and hurt, not careful anymore.

The second man reaches the junction behind him, crowding in the wet run. “Move, I got you—” He grabs the first man by the coat and tries to haul him back up, but the tight space turns them into a tangle.

Above, from the storage room, a third voice barks down—different timbre, older: “Stop shooting! I want her alive. Get a lantern down there—now!”

You retreat fast but controlled, blade up, body between Rusk and the entrance. Rusk crawls backward deeper, scraping elbows, doing exactly what you told him.

Immediate threat is still at the mouth: two men are jammed at the junction, one armed and now firing uncontrolled in a confined brick throat. Their next move is likely to switch tactics—bring steady light (a lantern) and/or fire into the conduit to flush you.

*Simulation triggers: secret_And Keep Your Whistle Ready_1_6214ce, secret_And Keep Your Whistle Ready_0_6d2d9e, secret_Ed_0_4596a9, guard_Ed_1_7ef733, fail_Ed_1_10b88f*

#### Turn 134 **[PLAYER]**

I grab the back of Rusk’s belt and hurry him deeper on hands-and-knees, whispering, “Find me a bend, a grate, anything—don’t stop.” As we go, I pause just long enough to feel along the wall for any side seam or ladder rungs, then keep moving, keeping us in the dark and putting as much brick between us and that junction as I can.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to bring a lantern and take their time; staying near the mouth is a death sentence. I need distance, a second exit, or a choke point we can actually defend—quietly. Also Rusk panics if I don’t keep him moving.*

#### Turn 135 **[GAME]**

You hook two fingers in the back of Rusk’s belt and urge him forward. He crawls fast but quiet, palms sliding over dust and old lime. Your whisper gets a tight nod; he doesn’t answer.

You move in short bursts: crawl, stop, listen; crawl, stop, feel. The conduit stays narrow enough that your shoulders brush both sides if you breathe too big. Brick gives way to older stone in places—rougher, damp-seeping, cold.

You pause and run your fingertips along the right wall: patches of flaking mortar, a hairline crack—then metal. Not rungs. A seam: a thin iron strip mortared into the wall like a frame, cold and slightly proud of the stone. You find a latch plate… but no handle, and the seam is packed with grit like it hasn’t been opened in years. It’s a side access door, but it’s sealed hard.

You keep moving.

Behind you, the junction noise shifts. The uncontrolled gunfire stops. Boots slosh, then retreat a step. A voice—muffled by distance but carrying in the tube—barks: “Lantern! And a hook—she’s in the side run!”

Then something new: metal scraping on brick, steady and deliberate, like they’re dragging a tool along the wall to find the mouth again.

Rusk suddenly freezes and points ahead with a shaking finger.

The conduit bends—hard left—about ten feet ahead. Past the bend you can’t see anything, but you can smell it: stagnant water and something sour-sweet underneath, like rot trapped in a jar. The floor dips slightly toward the bend.

As you crawl, your knee finds a slick patch you didn’t expect. The dust here is damp, almost greasy. Rusk’s hand slips; he catches himself with a soft slap.

The bend is real cover—brick between you and their light—but the dip means any lantern glow might still wash around the corner if they advance far enough, and the slick patch could betray you again with noise if you rush.

Immediate threat: the searchers have stopped firing and are switching to controlled pursuit with steady light and tools, and they’re still close enough that you can hear them preparing to push into the conduit.

#### Turn 136 **[PLAYER]**

I squeeze Rusk’s shoulder. “Slow—use your elbows, keep your weight low.” We crawl to the hard left bend and tuck just past it, then I quietly drag a couple loose stones/grit into a little ridge at the corner to make the floor treacherous without making a clatter. 

I press my ear to the wall, listening for their lantern and footsteps, then feel back along that iron-framed side seam for any way to pry it—hinge gap, latch play—keeping my voice to a breath: “If I tap twice, you keep crawling. Don’t wait for me.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re regrouping with better light and tools, so we need distance and cover fast. The hard bend is our best chance to break line-of-sight, but the dip and slick could make noise; I’ll move carefully, then use the bend to set a quiet, simple obstacle and check if that sealed side door can be forced as a fallback.*

#### Turn 137 **[GAME]**

Rusk nods once, jaw clenched, and switches to elbows like you told him—quiet, ugly progress. You both make the hard left and tuck just past it. The bend buys you a slab of brick between your bodies and the junction.

You rake your fingers through the damp grit at the corner and pull a couple thumb-sized stones into a low ridge where the floor dips—enough to catch a boot and turn an ankle, not enough to sound like construction. It holds.

You press your ear to the wall. At first it’s just water drip and your own blood moving.

Then: a lantern being coaxed to life—faint *tink-tink* of glass, a soft *whoomph* as a wick catches. The light itself you can’t see yet, but you can hear the men change how they move: slower, deliberate, careful with their footing now.

A voice carries down the conduit, closer than you want. The older one again, controlled: “No more shots. You see her, you call it. You don’t lunge.”

Another voice, the one you nicked, wet with rage and pain: “She cut me. I’m going in.”

Boots start into the conduit. Not running—probing. The lantern’s chain gives a tiny rhythmic jingle between steps.

You feel back along the iron-framed side seam. Up close, it’s worse than you hoped: the mortar has been packed into the frame edge like someone intentionally sealed it. You find a hinge line—two iron knuckles buried under grit—but there’s no gap you can get a fingertip into. The latch plate has the faint outline of a keyway… but it’s clogged and crusted over. You test it with a nail; it doesn’t give.

As you’re feeling it out, the lantern glow begins to wash around the bend in weak pulses—reflected off wet brick, not direct. They’re within a few yards of the corner now.

A boot scuffs, then stops. The man in front has seen something—your disturbed grit ridge, maybe, or the change in floor. He doesn’t step onto it.

He lowers his voice. “Corner ahead.”

The lantern chain goes still. For a beat, nobody moves.

Then metal scrapes softly—like a hooked tool being extended along the floor toward the bend, feeling for the ridge and anything beyond it. If that hook catches your ankle, your coat, or Rusk’s belt, they’ll have you without ever stepping around the corner.

No change to inventory or known NPC roster.

#### Turn 138 **[PLAYER]**

I tap Rusk twice and point deeper. “Go. Keep crawling.”

I stay just at the bend and, as the hook scrapes around, I pin it to the floor with my boot and use the hook-blade to catch and yank it hard sideways into the ridge so it clatters and binds—then I let go and crawl after Rusk fast, staying low and silent.

*Agent reasoning: The hook tool is the immediate threat; if it snags us we’re done. I need to neutralize it quietly and buy space without exposing Rusk, then keep moving toward any secondary exit.*

#### Turn 139 **[GAME]**

Two taps on Rusk’s shoulder. He doesn’t look back—just nods and keeps crawling into the dark, elbows and knees whispering over damp stone.

You plant your boot at the bend as the hook noses around the corner, metal teeth skating the greasy patch. The moment you feel its pull, you stomp down and catch it. With your other hand you snag the shaft with your hook-blade and wrench hard, sideways, aiming for the little ridge you built.

It works—too well.

The hook jams into the stones and bites brick. It *clatters* sharp as cutlery in a sink, then goes tight with a vibrating twang as someone on the other end yanks back.

Instant reaction: the lantern swings, and a broad yellow fan of light slaps the bend and spills farther than before. Your boot and blade throw hard shadows.

“Contact!” the injured man barks, voice right there.

The line goes taut again—your boot skids a half inch on the slick, but you keep it pinned long enough to let go. You release and crawl, fast, hugging the floor. Behind you, the hook scrapes free with a grinding pop and whips back out of sight.

A boot immediately steps onto your grit ridge—exactly where you wanted it. There’s a short, ugly yelp and a heavy stumble. The man catches himself against the wall, but the lantern swings wildly, throwing light in frantic arcs that chase you for a second down the conduit.

“There!” he spits, breathless. “She’s moving!”

Then the older voice, harsh and close: “Don’t go alone—keep the light steady!”

You gain distance, but not cleanly: the lantern has your direction now, and they’re committed. You hear them reorganize—one man steadying the lantern, the other dragging the hook back into position. Their boots resume, careful but faster, sloshing through the dip.

Ahead, Rusk is a darker shape in darker dark. He glances back once, eyes wide, then keeps crawling.

Threat is immediate and specific: they’ve confirmed your position and are pursuing with a steady lantern and the hooked tool, closing from behind down a narrow conduit with no visible side exits.

#### Turn 140 **[PLAYER]**

I hiss to Rusk, “Don’t look back—count your turns. First opening, we take it.” Keeping low, I crawl fast while sweeping my left hand along the wall for any seam, rung, or change in airflow; if I find even a cracked access panel, I’ll jam my hook-blade in and pry it enough for Rusk to slip through first. If there’s no exit in the next few yards, I stop at the next bend or narrowing and pull to the side, ready to slash the hook line the moment it snakes around the corner again.

*Agent reasoning: We can’t outrun a lantern and hook in a straight narrow tube; we need cover or an exit. I’ll keep moving but prioritize finding any side break, vertical access, or widening where we can ambush or slip past—without getting pinned in dead-end darkness.*

#### Turn 141 **[GAME]**

Rusk keeps crawling without another glance, shoulders tight, counting under his breath like a prayer you can’t quite hear.

You put on speed, left hand skating the wall: wet stone, flaked mortar, a run of old brick, then—cold metal again. Not a full door this time: a narrow vertical seam, iron set into the masonry like a service slit. You feel a faint draft through it, cooler and less sour than the conduit air.

You jam the hook-blade’s tip into the seam and lever.

The first pry does nothing.

The second pry pops something inside with a dull *tock*—and the seam opens a finger’s width. A dry shower of grit falls. The draft strengthens, carrying a different smell: dust and old paper, like a sealed room.

“Here,” you hiss, and shove the opening wider.

It widens grudgingly—then stops hard, as if a chain or internal bar catches. Wide enough for a hand… not wide enough for Rusk’s shoulders. Rusk tries anyway, twisting, sucking in his ribs; the iron edge bites his coat and he makes a small involuntary grunt of pain.

Behind you, the lantern light is stronger now, steady—no wild swinging. They learned.

“Hook forward,” the older one orders, calm as a clerk. “Keep it low.”

The hooked tool scrapes closer, more controlled, and you hear a new sound under it: a line paying out—rope or cable—soft rasp against brick.

You abandon the prying and drag Rusk back into motion. “Not this,” you breathe, and push him onward.

Ten feet ahead the conduit narrows slightly where a supporting arch pinches the walls—no bend, but a choke point. You flatten to the side just before it, giving Rusk space to slip past, and ready your hook-blade.

The hook arrives a heartbeat later, snaking around the narrow arch, teeth searching the floor.

You slash at the line.

Your blade bites—sparks flick off stone—and the line *doesn’t* part. It’s not hemp. It’s thin wire-cable with a cloth wrap, and it whips under the cut, stinging your knuckles. The hook jerks back hard, then lunges forward again, now aimed higher—at waist and shoulder height—trying to snag flesh or clothing, not just ankles.

The lantern is close enough that your shadow is visible on the wall ahead of you. They’re within a few yards, and they’ve switched from probing to active snaring with a cable that won’t cut easily.

#### Turn 142 **[PLAYER]**

I snap, “Rusk—keep going. Don’t stop unless I grab you.”  

As the hook lunges high, I duck and jam my hook-blade into the wire wrap near the hook head, twisting to snag and foul it, then I throw my weight sideways and down, trying to wedge the hook against the narrowing so it can’t retract cleanly. The second I feel it bind, I crawl hard back toward that iron service slit and start prying again—quiet but brutal—trying to pop whatever internal bar/chain is stopping it so Rusk can get through.

*Agent reasoning: The wire-cable won’t cut fast, so I need to break their leverage and buy distance—either by fouling the hook or forcing them to stop at the choke point. The partially-open service slit is a potential fallback, but it’s too tight for Rusk right now. I’ll use the narrow arch to trap the hook, then retreat and try the slit again with more force once they’re delayed.*

#### Turn 143 **[GAME]**

“Rusk—keep going. Don’t stop unless I grab you.”

He does. You hear his knees and elbows fade ahead, faster now, ragged breathing kept behind his teeth.

The hook lunges high. You duck under it and slam your hook-blade into the cloth-wrapped cable right behind the hook head, twisting hard. The blade catches the wrap and bites into the wire’s grooves—not cutting, but fouling. When you throw your weight sideways and down, the hook head slams into the narrowing arch with a sharp *clang* and wedges for half a second.

That half second costs them.

The injured man yanks and the cable doesn’t give cleanly; it saws against brick and your blade. The older one snaps, “Hold—hold the light—” and the lantern steadies, bathing the choke point in yellow.

Then the injured man changes tactics: he surges forward instead of pulling back. Boots splash, coat scrapes stone, and he drives the hook shaft with both hands like a spear to un-wedge it.

Your hook-blade skitters, ripping your palm as the cloth wrap tears. The hook pops free with a violent jerk. The sudden release pitches you onto your side and you slam a shoulder into the wall.

You scramble backward toward the iron service slit.

They’re on you now: the lantern is at arm’s length around the narrowing, and you finally see them—two Harbor “safety men” in oilskins, faces half-hidden by brims, one with a fresh bloody bandage at his forearm. The older one’s eyes flick to the slit the moment you do.

“Door,” he says, flat. “She’s got a door.”

You jam the hook-blade back into the slit seam and pry—quiet isn’t an option anymore. Iron shrieks against masonry. The seam opens a hair more… and stops on the same internal catch.

From the other side of the slit, something answers your force with a dull metallic rattle: a short chain, tensioned.

The older man steps in, reaches down, and produces a compact bolt-cutter from his coat like it’s part of the uniform. He doesn’t go for you first—he goes for the slit.

“Pin her,” he tells the injured one.

The injured man advances, hook raised again, angling to snag your leg or belt and drag you away from the slit. The threat is immediate: one is about to grab you with the hook at close range while the other prepares to cut through the slit’s chain—either to open it for himself or to deny it to you.

#### Turn 144 **[PLAYER]**

I shove a handful of wet grit up and into the lantern’s flame and glass as I lunge low, trying to snuff or at least fog it, then I slash the injured man’s hook-hand/shaft to knock it off-line and dive for his legs—using the slick floor to slide past him toward the darker stretch Rusk took. “You cut that chain and you’ll be crawling out blind,” I hiss at the older one as I scramble away.

*Agent reasoning: I can’t win a close grapple in a tunnel, and if they get the slit open they’ll have the advantage. Best move is to blind/disrupt the lantern and force space, then either slip past or buy seconds for Rusk; I’ll use the wet grit and my hook-blade to create a momentary opening without committing to a lethal fight.*

#### Turn 145 **[GAME]**

You scoop a fistful of wet grit and fling it up into the lantern as you lunge.

It doesn’t snuff—oil flame’s stubborn—but it does what you need: the grit spatters the hot glass and chimney, instantly baking into a smeary film. The light drops from a clean beam to a muddy, flickering glow. The older man jerks the lantern back, swearing as grit pings off the metal hood.

“—Christ—!”

In the same motion you slash at the injured man’s hook-hand and the shaft. Your blade bites leather and catches the oilskin cuff; he yelps and reflexively pulls back. The hook doesn’t get you—but the shaft swings wide, clanging off the wall.

You dive low at his legs, using the slick floor like a chute. Your shoulder hits his shins and he stumbles, trying to brace. For a second you’re under him, sliding past—

—and then his boot comes down hard on the back of your coat near the shoulder seam. Not a pin, but a stomp meant to catch fabric. The coat jerks; you feel the collar bite your throat. You still wriggle free, but it costs you speed and air.

You scramble toward the darker stretch where Rusk went, coughing, coat half-twisted.

Behind you the older man answers your hiss without looking at you. He’s already decided. “Then you shouldn’t have shown me the door.”

The bolt-cutter snaps once—metal on metal—followed by the unmistakable *clink* of a short chain going slack. The iron slit gives a fraction, like it wants to open.

The injured man, breathing hard, barks, “She’s getting away!”

“Let her,” the older one says, and you hear him shift his weight toward the slit. “You. After the cop.”

That splits the threat in two: one man commits to pursuing you into the dark, hook back in his hands and now moving fast despite the slick; the other stays at the service slit, working it open with the ruined lantern light close to his chest—either to bring more men through later or to cut off your route if you double back.

Ahead, in the darkness, you catch a brief sound from Rusk—an abrupt scrape and a muffled curse—like he’s hit a drop or a tight turn and nearly lost it.

#### Turn 146 **[PLAYER]**

I whisper hard, “Rusk—talk to me. Drop? Left or right?” then I grab a loose stone and whip it back down the tunnel to make a false clatter farther behind me. I crawl to the edge of the dark spot where he cursed, feel ahead with my hand for a lip or ladder, and press myself flat to the wall just before it—hook-blade ready to catch the pursuer’s cable if it comes around.

*Agent reasoning: Rusk may be hurt or stuck ahead, and I can’t let the pursuer close the distance with that hook. I need to slow him without getting cornered, then get eyes on Rusk and whatever caused the stumble—likely a drop or side junction we can use.*

#### Turn 147 **[GAME]**

“Rusk—talk to me. Drop? Left or right?”

For a beat there’s only the drip and your own breath. Then, from ahead, Rusk forces out a whisper like it hurts to make sound.

“Drop. Two… two feet. Then left—hard left. Pipe—don’t—” He sucks air. “—don’t grab the pipe.”

You find a loose chunk of brick at the wall base and whip it back the way you came. It skips and clatters, then you hear it tumble into a shallow puddle farther back with a satisfying *splash-scrape-scrape* that sounds like a body scrambling.

The pursuer reacts immediately. Boots scuff fast on stone; the hook scrapes, then lifts. “There—!” he blurts, voice snapping toward the noise.

He commits for a second—then checks himself, listening. The tunnel carries sound too well. He’s not stupid. “No,” he mutters, and you hear him angle forward again, quicker, hook low.

You crawl to where Rusk cursed and reach out into the dark with your left hand.

Your fingers find the lip: the conduit floor breaks into a short drop, about two feet, with a slick edge that’s been worn rounded. Past it, the passage kinks sharply left. On the right wall at the corner there’s a corroded pipe running along the bend—wet, slimy, and slightly loose in its mounts. When you touch near it, it shivers faintly, and you feel why Rusk warned you: it isn’t solid enough to take weight.

You press yourself flat against the wall just before the drop, hook-blade up and ready, making yourself small.

The pursuer arrives at the choke. His lantern-less silhouette is a darker shape against the faint, dirty glow behind him. He slows at the edge, hook hand up, listening for breath.

Then he does something worse than rushing: he lowers the hook head over the lip and lets it hang, cable paying out quietly. He’s fishing the drop and the left turn by feel, trying to snag whatever’s below without exposing himself.

The hook head swings once… twice… and starts drifting toward the pipe at the corner. If it catches that loose pipe, it’ll clang and possibly tear free—noise that gives you away *and* could block the bend.

You have a moment: the hook/cable is within reach, and the pipe is about to get involved.

#### Turn 148 **[PLAYER]**

I reach out and catch the cable just above the hook head, gloved hand clamping tight to stop its swing, then I wrap it once around my hook-blade and twist to bind it against the lip. Keeping my body flat and silent, I ease the hook down and wedge it under the ledge so it snags stone—not the pipe—then I slip over the drop and take the hard left after Rusk.

*Agent reasoning: If the hook catches the loose pipe, it’ll make noise and possibly trap me at the bend. Better to control the hook now—quietly—by fouling and anchoring it, buying time to drop and follow Rusk.*

#### Turn 149 **[GAME]**

Your hand shoots out and clamps the cable just above the hook head.

For an instant it works—swing killed dead, the line going taut through your fist. The wire’s wet and gritty, and it bites through your glove seams like teeth. You keep your body pinned flat and don’t give him the satisfaction of a sound.

You loop the cable once around your hook-blade and twist, using the lip as a brace. The wire creaks. The hook head dips under your control, and you guide it down toward the stone under-ledge instead of the loose pipe.

The pursuer feels the change immediately. The cable stops “talking” in his hand.

He freezes, then gives a short testing tug.

You’re ready for that: you wedge the hook head under the ledge so it catches stone. The line locks. When he tugs again, it answers with a hard, dead resistance—like it’s snagged on masonry, not flesh.

“Damn it,” he whispers, annoyed more than alarmed. He shifts his stance at the edge, preparing to haul it free.

That’s your window.

You ease yourself over the drop. Your boots hit the lower floor with a slick *thup* you can’t fully hide, but the bend steals the sound. You take the hard left.

Ahead, Rusk is there in the dark, half-crouched, one hand pressed to the wall like he’s steadying himself. “Pipe’s live,” he breathes. “It— it moves.”

Behind you, the pursuer gives the hook a sharper yank. The wedged hook holds for half a second—then your wrap around the hook-blade slips a fraction on the wet wire. The line grinds, squeals faintly, and the hook head tears free of the stone with a harsh *scrape*.

“Hey!” the man snaps, now certain someone’s been on his gear. You hear him drop down after it—boots hitting the lower level—and the cable zips as he gathers it in.

Threat is immediate and closing: he’s over the drop and coming around the left bend with the hook retracted, moving fast and now hunting by certainty instead of guesswork. The older man remains back at the service slit you left behind, with whatever opening he’s made there.

#### Turn 150 **[PLAYER]**

“Rusk—move. No talking.” I grab his sleeve and pull him forward, then as the pursuer rounds the bend I kick the loose pipe mount hard and shove the pipe outward into his path, using the rattle and swing to force him to flinch or stumble while we crawl fast into the dark.

*Agent reasoning: He’s close and confident now; I need a low-risk delay that uses the “live” loose pipe as a distraction/trip, then get distance without getting cornered. I’ll also keep Rusk moving and quiet.*

#### Turn 151 **[GAME]**

“Rusk—move. No talking.”

You clamp his sleeve and haul. He goes with you—stumbling at first, then catching the rhythm on hands and knees, keeping his weight low. He doesn’t argue, just breathes through his nose like he’s trying not to cough.

The hook-man hits the corner hard. You hear his boot scrape the wall and the cable hiss as he pulls it close, ready to strike blind.

You kick the loose pipe mount.

The corroded bracket gives with a sharp *ping* and the whole pipe lurches outward on its remaining clamp, swinging into the bend like a drunken arm. It doesn’t explode or spray—no steam—just a sudden, heavy swing and a nasty metallic rattle that fills the turn.

The pursuer flinches exactly like you want—throws a forearm up and checks his step. The pipe clips his shoulder and knocks him sideways into the wall. His hook scrapes sparks off stone as he catches himself.

“Son of a—!” he snarls, more furious now than cautious.

But the pipe keeps moving. The half-free mount drags and the pipe drops lower, scraping the floor. It doesn’t block the passage completely, but it turns the corner into a snagging hazard: he has to step over it and duck the swing, and his cable wants to catch on it.

You and Rusk use the moment. You drag him past the bend and into deeper dark, the floor narrowing and pitching slightly downward. Your palms hit slime; your knees find broken grit. Rusk’s breathing turns ragged—he’s hurt or winded—but he keeps moving.

Behind you, the hook-man recovers fast. You hear him shove the pipe aside with his boot, then a quick *clank* as his cable catches and he yanks it free. He’s delayed, not stopped—maybe a few seconds.

Then a new sound threads in from farther ahead: a low, steady hum, like machinery or current running through old conduit. And with it, a faint chemical bite in the air—sharp, clean, wrong for damp stone.

Rusk whispers despite you: “That’s— that’s the junction. Don’t touch—”

The threat now is twofold and immediate:
- **Behind:** the hook-man is coming around the bend again, closing.
- **Ahead:** you’re crawling toward an active utility junction or machinery space in the dark—something humming, likely electrified, and the floor is getting wetter.

#### Turn 152 **[PLAYER]**

I hiss, “Rusk—eyes up. Dry path. Where’s the safest edge—left wall or right?” and I shove him slightly ahead to lead. Without stopping, I scrape my hook-blade along the wall to feel for metal conduit and keep my hands off anything slick-looking, then I fling another stone behind us into the wet to draw the hook-man into the noisiest, slickest line while we hug the driest side.

*Agent reasoning: The hum and chemical bite suggest electrified equipment and possibly chlorine/ammonia—touching anything could kill us, but we can use the junction as a deterrent if we can identify a safe path. I need Rusk to guide us while I slow the pursuer without committing to a lethal gamble.*

#### Turn 153 **[GAME]**

Rusk swallows a breath and forces his eyes open wider, scanning by feel and the faintest sheen.

“Right,” he rasps. “Right wall—stone. Left’s got—metal run.”

You shove him a half-body length ahead. He crawls like a man afraid to touch anything, keeping his shoulder almost brushing the right wall. You follow tight behind, hook-blade scraping along the right-hand masonry in short, controlled strokes.

The scrape tells you what your eyes can’t: rough brick and mortar at first—then, a few feet on, the blade kisses something smooth and cold protruding from the wall: a thin metal strap or conduit clip. You lift the blade off it immediately and shift your line even closer to the stone, palms careful, fingers spread to avoid anything wet.

The floor changes texture under your knees—wetter, with a slick film that pulls at fabric. The hum ahead grows louder and steadier, and the air sharpens with that clean chemical bite.

You snatch a loose stone and throw it back into the darkness behind you.

It skitters, then hits a pooled section with a loud *slap* and a long, ugly *sssskkk* as it slides. A half-second later, another *slap*—it’s bounced into a second puddle closer to the bend.

The hook-man reacts to the sound exactly as intended: you hear him surge forward. His boot lands in the wet with an unmistakable skid and a hard scrape against stone. He catches himself with a curse—“Shit!”—and his hook head clacks once as it taps the floor.

But he doesn’t go down. He slows, adjusts, and starts coming again—more careful now, dragging the hook low like a feeler.

Rusk keeps you on the drier right edge, but the “dry” is relative: the right wall is crumbling and narrow here, and the wet film is creeping across it in streaks. Ahead, the passage opens into a junction space: you can make out a squat boxy silhouette on the left wall (likely an old service cabinet) and a darker trench-like channel cut into the floor where water is flowing.

Threats are now clear and close:
- **Behind:** the pursuer is still advancing, slowed by the slick but adapting; you can hear his careful steps and the hook probing.
- **Ahead/left:** the metal run and service cabinet area are likely energized; the wet channel on the floor is actively moving water, widening the hazard zone as you approach the junction.

#### Turn 154 **[PLAYER]**

I press my mouth close to Rusk’s ear. “Point out the trench edge—how wide, and is there a dry lip on the right we can shimmy past without stepping in?”

I grab another small stone and toss it toward the left cabinet/metal run (not into the water), listening for a telltale crackle or pop, then keep us hugging the right wall while I plant my hook-blade point into the crumbly mortar to steady our balance and prepare to shove Rusk past the junction fast.

*Agent reasoning: The junction sounds electrified and the floor is getting wetter, so rushing risks getting shocked. We need a safe path across/around the trench and a way to slow the hook-man without touching live metal—ideally by forcing him into the water/metal side while we take the right wall.*

#### Turn 155 **[GAME]**

Rusk leans his head back just enough to listen, eyes fixed on the floor ahead like he’s reading a map only he can see.

“Trench,” he whispers. “Two feet across. Runs left-to-right—then turns and follows the left wall. Right side’s got a lip—six inches, maybe. Not dry. Just… less wet.”

You take another stone and flick it toward the left wall, aiming for the cabinet silhouette and the metal run above it.

The stone hits metal with a hollow *tunk*—then a sharp, insect-fast *tick-tick-tick* like it’s skittering down a conduit strap. For a beat, nothing.

Then: a thin, angry *snap* and a brief blue-white spit of light from the cabinet seam—like a tongue of arc searching for ground. It’s small, but it’s real. The smell in the air changes immediately: hot dust and ozone laid over that chemical clean.

Rusk jerks his hand back from the floor as if he felt it through the stone. “It’s live,” he says, louder than he means to.

Behind you, the hook-man hears it too—the *snap* carries. His pace changes: the careful steps stop. You hear him shift, then come faster, like he’s decided the hazard is worth it if it corners you. The hook head clacks once, then scrapes along the floor, probing for the trench line.

You plant the hook-blade point into the right wall’s crumbly mortar. It bites shallow, flakes brick dust, but it gives you purchase—enough to keep your weight off the slickest patch as you angle Rusk toward the narrow right-hand lip.

The junction is now directly in front of you:
- **Left:** the cabinet is actively arcing intermittently; any contact with the metal run or cabinet could shock, especially with the wet film.
- **Center:** the trench carries moving water; stepping in it risks a slip and also risks bridging current if the cabinet spits again.
- **Right:** a narrow, uneven lip you can shimmy along, but it’s only a handspan wide and shedding grit under pressure.

The hook-man is close enough now that you can hear his breathing between his steps—maybe one bend away—closing while you’re committed to crossing the junction.

#### Turn 156 **[PLAYER]**

“Rusk, belt—now. Loop it on my wrist.” I thread his belt/strap through my arm and tug it tight like a leash, then I plant the hook-blade into the right wall as a handhold and shove Rusk ahead onto the six-inch lip, keeping his shoulder pinned to stone.

As we start to shimmy, I hiss, “Do not touch left—don’t even look at it,” and kick a pebble toward the cabinet side again to keep that snapping arc and draw the hook-man into the wet center while we hug the right edge.

*Agent reasoning: The cabinet is live and the trench water could carry current; the safest route is the narrow right lip, but Rusk may slip. I need to get him across fast while buying seconds—without touching metal or splashing. I’ll use my hook-blade as an anchor and my belt/coat as a tether, and I’ll try to bait the pursuer into the hazard with noise on the left.*

#### Turn 157 **[GAME]**

Rusk fumbles at his waist with numb fingers. You catch the belt/strap, thread it over your wrist, and cinch it down until it bites. It isn’t pretty, but it’s a tether.

You sink the hook-blade point into the right wall again. Mortar crumbles; the blade finds a harder seam and holds. With your other hand, you shove Rusk forward.

He gets one foot onto the six-inch lip, toes turned sideways, shoulder scraping stone. His heel skates once on slime—your tether goes taut—and you jerk him back into the wall before he can step into the trench. He winces but keeps moving, breath coming in short, panicked pulls.

“Don’t touch left,” you hiss.

Rusk doesn’t answer. He’s staring at the stone in front of his nose like it’s the only safe thing in the city.

You kick a pebble toward the cabinet side.

It taps metal—*tink*—and a heartbeat later the cabinet answers with a harsher, longer arc: *KRK-KRK*, a blue-clean spit that crawls along the seam and flashes against the wet air. The moving water in the trench ripples as if something just struck near it. The ozone stink thickens.

Behind you, the hook-man rounds the bend and sees the junction’s geometry: trench in the middle, live cabinet on the left, your two bodies pressed to the right lip. He doesn’t charge straight in. He stops just short of the trench and tests with the hook, lowering it toward the wet center like he’s measuring depth.

“Thought you could bottle-neck me?” he says, voice tight. Then he swings the hook head low and *drags* it across the slick toward the right—aiming for your tether and ankles rather than the cabinet.

The hook scrapes stone, sending a spray of dirty water. It catches the edge of the lip with a hard *clack* and jolts your planted hook-blade in the wall; your handhold shudders. Rusk yelps and flattens harder into the stone, trying not to lose his footing.

Immediate, concrete danger:
- The hook-man is now fishing along the right lip; one good snag will yank Rusk (or you) into the trench.
- Your hook-blade handhold is holding, but the wall is shedding grit; repeated impacts may rip it free.
- The cabinet is arcing longer now; any slip left into metal/water could turn lethal fast.

I yank the belt hard to pull Rusk another half-step forward along the lip. “Keep sliding—don’t stop.”  
As the hook scrapes toward our feet again, I drop my weight and stab my hook-blade down onto the cable/hook head against the lip, trying to pin it to stone long enough to shove it back into the wet center and buy us a few seconds to clear the junction.

*Agent reasoning: The hook is targeting our ankles/tether; I need to stop its reach without stepping into the trench or near the live cabinet. Best is to pin or foul the hook line against the right wall, keep Rusk moving, and avoid a direct fight.*

#### Turn 160 **[PLAYER]**

I yank the belt hard to drag Rusk a half-step farther along the lip. “Keep sliding—don’t stop.”  
When the hook scrapes in again, I drop my weight and drive my hook-blade down onto the hook head/cable against the lip, trying to pin it to the stone just long enough to shove it back into the wet center and buy us a few seconds to clear the junction.

*Agent reasoning: The hook’s fishing along the lip is the immediate threat—if it snags a leg or the tether, we’re in the trench and possibly into live current. I need to keep Rusk moving while I briefly immobilize the hook head and force it back into the wet center, then follow fast before my handhold or footing fails.*

#### Turn 161 **[GAME]**

The belt goes taut as you yank. Rusk lurches a half-step forward on the lip—his shoe sole squeals on slime—but he stays upright. He keeps sliding, shoulders grinding the wall, eyes fixed ahead.

The hook comes in again, low and ugly. You drop your weight and drive the hook-blade down.

Steel meets steel with a jarring *clang* that vibrates up your arm. For a second you’ve got it: the hook head pinned against the lip, the cable trapped under your blade’s edge. The hook-man grunts, surprised, and the line goes tight in his hands.

You shove.

The hook head skitters off the lip and drops into the wet trench with a loud *splash*. That buys you exactly the moment you wanted—Rusk gets another step, and you start to follow.

Then the consequence hits: the hook-man doesn’t let go. He yanks the cable back hard.

The cable, now in the water, draws a bright blue-white *snap* from the cabinet side—like the current found a better path. The arc leaps across the damp air and kisses the cable; the trench water shivers and flashes for an instant. The smell of ozone spikes, sharp enough to sting your nose.

The hook-man jerks as if punched. His hands clamp and then fling wide; he staggers back, swearing—“Son of a—!”—and you hear the hook clatter as he loses control of the line for a beat.

But your own hook-blade takes the hit through contact: a violent buzz in the metal, not full electrocution, but enough to numb your fingers and make your grip stutter. The blade tip gouges the stone as you reflexively pull it up.

Rusk, ahead of you, flinches at the crack and almost looks left—then catches himself and presses his face into the wall again, breathing ragged.

Clear threats now:
- The hook-man is momentarily stunned and has lost clean control of the cable, but he’s not down; he’s already reaching to recover it.
- The cable is now a live hazard in the trench: if it’s still bridging water and cabinet-side metal, another arc could jump unpredictably.
- Your right hand is numb and shaky from the shock through the blade; your wall handhold is less reliable until feeling returns.

#### Turn 162 **[PLAYER]**

“Move, Rusk—now, don’t stop.” I haul the belt to drag him another step or two past the worst of the junction, keeping us plastered to the right wall.

I tuck my numb hand against my coat to warm it and switch my hook-blade to my other hand, eyes on the trench and cable; if the hook-man reaches for it again, I kick grit/loose stones into the trench from the right lip to splash and distract without getting close to the cabinet.

*Agent reasoning: The cable in the trench is now a live hazard, and my hand is numb—fighting more is risky. Best move is to use the hook-man’s brief stun to clear the junction, keep Rusk moving, and avoid touching anything conductive.*

#### Turn 163 **[GAME]**

You haul the belt again. Rusk stumbles forward—one step, then another—boots scraping that narrow lip. He doesn’t stop this time; he’s running on your pull and pure fear, shoulder and cheek glued to the right wall like it can hide him.

Your numb hand disappears into your coat. The sting fades to a deep ache, fingers clumsy but not dead. You swap the hook-blade to your other hand; the grip feels wrong for a heartbeat, then workable.

In the trench, the cable lies half-submerged, twitching in weak little pulls as the hook-man gathers himself. The live cabinet on the left ticks and spits intermittently, blue-clean flashes reflecting off the water like teeth.

The hook-man shakes out his hands, swearing under his breath. He doesn’t reach into the water bare-handed again. Instead, he crouches and uses the hook’s shaft like a rake, trying to snag the cable from a safer angle—keeping his body back from the cabinet side.

You kick loose grit and small stones off the right lip.

They patter into the trench—*tik-tik-tik*—and the water answers with quick splashes. It’s enough movement to make the cable bob and drift, and it forces the hook-man to pause, recalculating where to place his tool. One stone strikes the cable; a faint *snap* of blue light jumps and dies in the water. He flinches hard and jerks the hook back, eyes wide now, more cautious.

Rusk makes it past the worst of the junction—clear of the cabinet’s closest reach—and the lip widens by maybe an inch. Not much, but it’s the first mercy you’ve seen in this conduit.

The hook-man recovers fast. He steps sideways along his bank, staying out of the trench, and changes tactics: he raises the hook and swings it higher, aiming not for your feet but for the belt line between you and Rusk—trying to catch the tether and use it to yank *both* of you off balance.

Threat, immediate and specific: the next swing is coming at waist height; if it catches the belt, you could be jerked backward into the junction while Rusk is pulled off the lip.

“Unbuckle—now!” I snap, yanking the belt free from my wrist and shoving it forward at Rusk’s hands as I flatten to the wall. I bring the hook-blade up crosswise to catch/deflect the incoming hook swing, then backstep along the widened lip to keep distance from the junction.

*Agent reasoning: If he catches the belt, we both go down. Best is to remove the target fast and keep Rusk moving, while using the hook-blade to intercept the swing without overcommitting near the live water/cabinet.*

#### Turn 165 **[GAME]**

“Unbuckle—now!”

Rusk’s hands fumble at his waist like he’s working a lock in the dark. He gets the buckle tongue halfway out—then freezes as the hook-man’s shadow rises.

You yank the belt free from your wrist and thrust the slack toward Rusk. He grabs it with both hands, knuckles white, still trying to free himself from it at the same time.

The hook swings in at waist height, a wide, mean arc meant to catch leather and take you both.

You flatten to the right wall and bring the hook-blade up crosswise.

Metal slams metal—*CLANG*—and the impact drives your forearm into your ribs. You do deflect it, but not clean. The hook’s point skates down your blade and catches the belt instead of your hip.

Leather bites tight. The line goes taut.

The hook-man uses the catch immediately, planting his boots and hauling backward with his whole weight. The belt jerks like a live thing.

Rusk yelps and is yanked a half-step back toward the junction; his heel slips on the wet lip and he windmills, shoulder banging the wall. He doesn’t go in—but he’s teetering, one foot searching air over the trench.

You backstep along the widened lip like you planned, but the belt’s tension fights you; it drags at your centerline, trying to pull you back into the narrowest part. Your hook-blade is still engaged with the hook head, but the belt is now the leverage point, not the steel.

The hook-man snarls, close enough now you can hear his breath. “Got you.”

Immediate threat: if he gets one more hard pull, Rusk’s balance breaks and he drops into the trench near the live cable/cabinet side. You’re also at risk of being yanked backward into the junction, where footing narrows and the electrified water is closest.

“Let it go, Rusk!” I snap, then saw the hook-blade down hard across the belt where it’s caught, trying to sever it in one or two strokes. As soon as it gives, I shove Rusk forward by the shoulder into the wider section and keep my body between him and the hook-man, blade up and ready to deflect the next swing.

*Agent reasoning: The belt is now a liability; if it stays hooked, one yank drops Rusk into the trench. Best is to remove the leverage point immediately—cut the belt—then use the moment to get Rusk stable and create distance.*

#### Turn 167 **[GAME]**

“Let it go, Rusk!”

Rusk’s eyes flick to you—then to the trench—then he obeys. His fingers open and the belt whips tight in the hook-man’s pull, no longer anchored by Rusk’s grip.

You saw the hook-blade down across the leather where it’s cinched on the hook point. The first stroke bites but skids—wet leather, tensioned hard, fights you. The second stroke lands true. The belt parts with a sharp *snap* and both halves recoil: one end slaps the stone lip near your boots; the other end jerks back with the hook as the hook-man’s leverage suddenly vanishes.

The hook-man stumbles backward, arms flaring to catch his balance. His boots scrape on his bank; he doesn’t fall in, but he loses his stance and the hook dips low.

You take the opening and shove Rusk forward by the shoulder. He staggers into the wider section, catches himself against the wall, and keeps moving—breathing like he’s swallowing nails.

The hook-man recovers fast. He lifts the hook again, but his expression has changed—less confident, more careful. He doesn’t swing immediately. Instead, he jabs the hook tip toward your legs, testing your distance, trying to herd you back toward the junction without committing.

Behind him, the trench water still twitches around the cable. A faint blue flicker pops once—small, but close enough to remind you what a misstep costs.

Rusk, now a few paces ahead, calls back hoarsely without turning: “There’s— there’s a maintenance ladder—up ahead—”

Immediate threat: the hook-man is probing for a low catch on your ankle or coat hem; one successful snag could yank you off the lip into the trench, where the live cable and cabinet-side arcs are still intermittently flashing.

“Rusk—get on that ladder and don’t look back.”

I keep my back to the right wall and shuffle-retreat toward the wider section, blade low to swat his hook aside if it comes in at my ankles; as I move, I angle my steps to kick the severed belt end off the lip into the trench so there’s less for him to snag or use.

*Agent reasoning: I can’t afford to get snagged, and trading blows on this lip is suicidal. I’ll keep my stance tight to the wall, use the blade to control his hook rather than attack, and retreat toward the ladder while buying Rusk time to climb.*

#### Turn 169 **[GAME]**

“Rusk—get on that ladder and don’t look back.”

Rusk doesn’t argue. He lurches ahead, one hand skimming the wall for balance. In the wider section the conduit opens enough to see it: a rusted maintenance ladder bolted into the right wall, rungs slick with condensation. He grabs it and starts climbing, boots clanging softly—fast, ugly, determined.

You keep your back to the right wall and shuffle-retreat, blade low.

The hook-man takes the hint and goes for your feet. He snaps the hook in low, a quick ankle-height jab meant to catch and pull. You swat it aside with the hook-blade; steel bites steel with a grating *krrt* and the hook glances off toward the trench instead of into your shin.

As you move, you angle a step and kick the severed belt end off the lip.

It flips out into the trench and slaps the water.

For a half-second it just floats—then the cable under the surface twitches and the water answers with that too-clean blue flash. The belt end jerks like it’s alive and sinks, smoking faintly. The air sharpens with burnt leather and copper.

The hook-man recoils from the flash, but it also tells him something: the trench is “live” enough to punish anything that falls in. He stops trying to muscle you and shifts to forcing a mistake—short, impatient feints that try to make you step wide.

Above you, Rusk reaches the top of the ladder—or what passes for “top” here: a dark square cutout with a lip of corroded metal. He wedges a shoulder through and hisses down, breath ragged: “Hatch—stuck—”

Immediate, concrete danger: the hook-man is about to commit to a hard, two-handed yank aimed at your blade arm—trying to knock your guard wide so his next low sweep can take your footing. One stumble, and the electrified trench is directly under your left foot.

#### Turn 170 **[PLAYER]**

“Brace your feet on the rung—kick the hatch lip, don’t pry with your fingers!”

I drop my center of gravity and step in close to jam his hook-shaft with my forearm and blade, then stomp at his forward boot/shin to spoil his two-handed yank; if it buys even a heartbeat, I back into the ladder’s base and angle my body to climb up after Rusk.

*Agent reasoning: I need to avoid getting yanked off balance near the live trench; buying a second for Rusk to force the hatch matters more than landing hits. I’ll keep distance, disrupt his grip, and get Rusk moving with clear instructions.*

#### Turn 171 **[GAME]**

“Brace your feet on the rung—kick the hatch lip, don’t pry with your fingers!”

Rusk, above, grunts an acknowledgement and plants his boots on a rung hard enough to rattle the ladder. You hear the dull *thud-thud* of him kicking at the hatch lip overhead.

Down on the lip, you drop your weight and step in before the hook-man can get that two-handed yank. Close up, he smells like wet rope and cheap camphor. You drive your forearm into the hook’s shaft and pin it against your hook-blade, turning his leverage into a cramped wrestle.

He tries to wrench free anyway—shoulders bunching, elbows flaring—but your stomp lands on his forward shin/boot edge with a solid, ugly *crack*.

He barks out a sound that’s half pain, half fury, and his stance buckles. The hook dips; the point scrapes stone and sparks once as it kisses the wet lip.

You get your heartbeat of space.

You back into the base of the ladder, keeping the blade between you and him, and set your hand on the lowest rung to start up.

He recovers faster than you’d like. Limping, he changes tactics: instead of pulling, he swings the hook head sideways at knee height, aiming to catch the ladder upright itself—either to yank you off as you climb or to rattle Rusk above.

The hook catches the ladder’s side rail with a metallic *CLONK* and he hauls.

The whole ladder shudders. Your grip slips a fraction on the wet rung, and above you Rusk curses as his boots skid on the rung he’s braced on. The hatch lip overhead gives a little—metal squealing—then stops, still mostly jammed.

Immediate threat: if the hook-man gets a second solid pull on the ladder rail, it’ll wrench you off-balance at the base and could peel Rusk off his rung above; either of you could fall—into each other or off the lip toward the live trench.

#### Turn 172 **[PLAYER]**

I hook my boot around the ladder’s lowest rung and lean my weight into it to steady the rail, then slash down at the hook where it’s biting the ladder—aiming to shear his leverage or force him to let go. “Rusk—again, hard! If it moves, drop through!”

*Agent reasoning: If he keeps yanking the ladder, both of us risk falling into the live trench. I need to stop the pull fast without overcommitting—disable his grip/anchor point and create space for Rusk to finish the hatch, then climb.*

#### Turn 173 **[GAME]**

You hook your boot around the lowest rung and lean in, turning your leg into a brace. The ladder stops skating sideways—still vibrating, but it holds.

You chop down at the hook where it’s biting the rail.

Steel meets steel at an ugly angle. Your blade doesn’t shear the hook—too thick, too well-forged—but it *does* bite the wooden wedge lashed just behind the hook head (a spacer he’s using to keep purchase on slick metal). The wedge splits. The hook shifts, loses its “tooth,” and scrapes down the rail in a shower of tiny sparks.

The hook-man has to let go for a half-second to keep from losing the tool entirely. He snatches it back with a hiss, shaking his stung hands, limping worse now.

“Rusk—again, hard! If it moves, drop through!”

Above, Rusk answers with a strangled “Got it!” and drives both boots into the hatch lip. The metal finally gives with a tearing squeal. A rectangle of darker air opens overhead—and with it, a gust that smells like tar paper and rain instead of copper.

Rusk doesn’t bother being graceful. He drops through the opening onto whatever’s above with a heavy *thump* and a yelp, then immediately scrambles away from the hole. His voice comes down tight: “I’m up—Lena, NOW—”

The hook-man, seeing his window closing, lunges—not at you, but at the ladder itself, shoving his shoulder into the rail to rattle it and buy one last chance to pull you off the base.

The ladder bucks under your braced boot. Your knee twinges hard from the torque, but it doesn’t slip.

Immediate threat: he’s about to switch from the ladder to *you*—a straight thrust with the hook point aimed at your thigh/hip while you’re half-turned to climb. If it lands, you’ll be pinned against the rungs with the trench at your left.

#### Turn 174 **[PLAYER]**

I twist off the ladder and slam my forearm and shoulder into his hook-arm to jam the thrust wide, then kick his bad shin again to make him fold. If he staggers, I pivot back, grab the rungs, and climb hard—shouting up, “Rusk, hand down—now!”

*Agent reasoning: I can’t risk getting pinned mid-climb; I need to spoil his line of thrust and create just enough space to ascend fast. A quick shove/deflection into the trench side is safer than trading blows.*

#### Turn 175 **[GAME]**

You twist off the ladder just as the hook point comes in.

Your shoulder and forearm smash into his hook-arm. The thrust gets knocked wide—close enough you feel the hook’s cold draft past your coat—but it doesn’t bite you. The hook tip skitters along the ladder rail instead, screeching metal.

He tries to re-aim with brute strength.

You kick his bad shin again.

This time he folds at the knee with a sharp, involuntary drop of weight. His free hand slaps the wall to keep him from going down into the trench side. The hook clatters, and for a breath he’s off-balance, face tight and wet with rain-sweat.

You pivot back to the ladder, grab the rungs, and climb hard.

“Rusk, hand down—now!”

Above, Rusk’s arm snakes down through the hatch—fingers splayed, searching blind. You get two rungs up and catch his wrist. His grip locks like a vise and he hauls while you climb, turning your scramble into a jagged, fast ascent.

Below, the hook-man recovers enough to lash out at your ankle. The hook catches your heel for a split-second—more snag than stab—yanking your boot down and wrenching your knee. Your foot slips off the rung and swings out over the live trench.

Rusk yanks *up* hard, and the hook tears free with a ripping scrape off your boot leather instead of dragging you down. Your shin smacks the ladder rail; pain blooms hot, but you’re still climbing.

You get your torso to the hatch lip. Rusk grabs your collar and shoulder and drags you through onto a cramped service space above—tarred boards, low beams, and rain pattering on something like roof sheeting.

Immediate threat: the hook-man is already climbing after you, fast despite the limp. His hook scrapes on the rungs below, and the ladder is still shuddering—if he reaches the hatch, he’ll have the high ground denied but the choke point controlled.

#### Turn 176 **[PLAYER]**

I slam the hatch cover back down as far as it’ll go and jam my hook-blade through any gap/hasp to bar it. “Rusk—help me wedge it, then we move; no hero stuff.”

*Agent reasoning: He’s coming up the same ladder; a choke point favors whoever controls the hatch. I’m hurt, so I should avoid a prolonged fight and instead block or collapse his access while we can.*

#### Turn 177 **[GAME]**

You drop to a knee and shove the hatch cover down. It isn’t a hinged “door” so much as a heavy, warped metal plate that rides in a crude frame—meant to slide and seat. It slams partway, then stops with a teeth-rattling *clang* against the same bend that jammed it earlier. There’s still a hand-wide gap on one side.

You jam your hook-blade through the gap, catching it under a corroded crossbar/hasp nub on the frame. Metal squeals as you lever the blade sideways to bite. It holds—barely—your grip vibrating with each tremor from below.

“Rusk—help me wedge it, then we move; no hero stuff.”

Rusk is already there, breathing hard, face pale in the dim. He nods once and snatches a loose chunk of tarred board from the floor. “Yeah. Yeah—no hero.” He slams the board edge-first into the gap above your blade, hammering it with the heel of his hand until it wedges tight.

From below: the hook-man hits the ladder rungs hard—fast climbing. The hatch rattles as he reaches up and shoves. Your blade flexes in the gap; the board creaks.

Then the hook tip punches up through the remaining space, stabbing blind for anything soft. It scrapes your sleeve, missing skin by an inch, and catches the wedged board instead. He yanks. The board shifts a finger-width.

Rusk grabs the board with both hands and shoves it back in, snarling, “Stay DOWN there!”

The hook-man answers with a wet laugh that turns into a cough. You hear him reposition—hook scraping the frame, searching for a better bite. If he finds purchase on your hook-blade or the crossbar nub, he can pry the whole jam loose.

As you hold the blade steady, you notice something else: the tarred boards you’re kneeling on aren’t solid decking. One section near the hatch has been cut and re-laid—fresh nails, different tar. A maintenance access, disguised.

Immediate threat is twofold: the hatch jam is holding but degrading under prying, and there may be a second way up into this space the hook-man already knows—through that patched section.

#### Turn 178 **[PLAYER]**

“Rusk—keep pressure on that wedge. Don’t grab the hook if it comes through.”

I ease my hook-blade out a hair to avoid it being used as leverage, then shove a loose board and any scrap I can reach into the gap to thicken the jam. While Rusk holds, I crawl to the patched section, press my ear to it, and test the nails with my blade tip—quietly—listening for movement underneath.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch jam won’t hold long, and that patched floor could be a second entry point or escape route. I need to keep the hook-man from prying my blade loose while we relocate fast, ideally blocking both access points or buying seconds to flee.*

#### Turn 179 **[GAME]**

“Rusk—keep pressure on that wedge. Don’t grab the hook if it comes through.”

Rusk plants his shoulder over the hatch seam and leans his weight into the board, palms white-knuckled. “I’m on it—just—move.”

You ease your hook-blade back a fraction. The moment the steel stops acting like a pin, the hatch plate shivers—like it wants to spring. A hook tip snaps up through the gap, probing for your blade. It finds only air and scrapes the frame, annoyed.

You feed in whatever you can reach: a loose slat, then a splintered strip of tarred lath. You shove them into the seam above the main wedge until the gap looks packed, not just blocked. The hook stabs again and catches wood instead of purchase. You hear a frustrated grunt below and the wet rasp of him dragging the hook away to try a different angle.

Rusk hisses through his teeth as the pressure changes. “He’s prying—slow, but—”

You crawl off, low, to the patched section. Up close it’s obvious: newer nails, set too straight, heads still sharp-edged. Not old work. Done fast.

You press your ear to it.

At first, only rain on sheeting and Rusk’s breath. Then: a faint *tap…tap…tap* from beneath, not random settling—deliberate, spaced. Metal on wood, like someone feeling for the edge of the patch with a tool.

You test a nail head with the tip of your blade, gently rocking it.

It doesn’t squeal. It *shifts*—a hair—like the nail isn’t fully set into real joist, more into a thin backing strip. This patch isn’t meant to hold weight; it’s meant to look intact.

Under your ear, the tapping stops.

A second later, the wood under your cheek gives the smallest upward flex—someone below has put pressure on it, finding the weak spot. Dust sifts through a seam line you hadn’t noticed until it moved.

Threat, clear: there’s at least one person directly under the patched boards, preparing to push up into this space while the hook-man keeps you busy at the hatch.

#### Turn 180 **[PLAYER]**

I hiss, “Rusk—second entry, patched floor, right here. Don’t leave the hatch.”

I roll off the patch and plant my weight beside it, not on it, then drive my blade tip into the seam and pry up just enough to see or catch fingers—ready to stomp the panel back down if it lifts. “Whoever’s under there—don’t. I’ll pin you to the joists.”

*Agent reasoning: There’s a second attacker about to come up through the patched boards; I need to warn Rusk without pulling him off the hatch, and I should deny the entry point while keeping myself out of a sudden grab.*

#### Turn 181 **[GAME]**

“Second entry,” you hiss. “Patched floor, right here. Don’t leave the hatch.”

Rusk doesn’t look over. He just shifts his stance to keep his shoulder jammed into the wedge, voice strained. “Got it. I’m not moving.”

You roll off the patch and plant your weight on the solid boards beside it. The patched section flexes again—someone below testing it. You drive your hook-blade tip into the seam and lever up a bare inch.

A sliver of darkness opens—and a human eye appears in it, wide and bloodshot, staring up at steel.

You catch a flash of a face: young, maybe late teens, skin slick with sweat, a bruise-purple crescent on the neck like a thumbprint. Salt grit clings to their hairline. Their hand comes up fast, fingers splayed, not to grab you—more like to shield their face from the blade.

“Don’t,” you warn. “I’ll pin you to the joists.”

The kid freezes, breath fluttering. “Please—don’t—” Their voice is hoarse, drug-thick. “They’re behind me.”

Behind them: a second sound, closer and heavier than the tapping—a controlled scrape of boots on a rung or narrow ladder under the patch. Someone else is coming up the same access, using the kid as the first body through.

At the hatch, the hook-man changes tactics. There’s a hard *clank* as he hooks something solid—your packed seam shifts, not much, but enough that the hatch plate bumps upward a fraction. Rusk grunts as the pressure tries to peel him off it. “He’s got purchase—Lena—!”

Under your blade, the kid’s eye darts sideways in panic as a shadow crowds them from below. A hand—larger, rougher—slides into the gap from under the patch, groping for the lifted edge to rip it up.

You now have two immediate threats:
1) the hatch jam is starting to give under prying force; if it pops, the hook-man is coming through fast.
2) someone stronger than the kid is about to force the patched panel open from below, right in front of you.

#### Turn 182 **[PLAYER]**

I snap my blade down flat on the larger hand—using the spine to smash knuckles, not cut—then shove the kid’s shoulder back through the gap. “Crawl away from the opening, now—quiet.”

I drop my weight onto the patch edge and stomp it down, then drag a heavy board across it like a bar. Over my shoulder I bark, “Rusk—if that hatch jumps, let it go and fall back toward me. We don’t get pinched in two places.”

*Agent reasoning: Two breaches at once is how you die. The kid is a shield and a source of info; I can use them to jam the patch while buying Rusk seconds at the hatch. I’ll disable the reaching hand without committing to a full fight, then force the panel shut and add weight/obstacles.*

#### Turn 183 **[GAME]**

You bring the spine of the hook-blade down like a hammer.

It lands on knuckles with a dull *thunk*—bone on steel—with a sharp, involuntary yelp from below. The bigger hand spasms and withdraws so fast it scrapes skin on the seam. Something metal clatters down there—tool dropped, or the hook scraping a rung.

You shove the kid’s shoulder with your free hand, not gently. They flinch, then scramble backward out of the slit, elbows and knees scraping wood. “Okay—okay—” they whisper, already trying to make themselves small in the dark.

The patch edge lifts a fraction again as weight shifts below—then you drop yours onto it and stomp. The boards settle with a flat, ugly *whump* that knocks dust out of the seams. You drag a heavier plank across the patch like a bar and pin it under your knee.

It holds—for now—but you feel it: the patch isn’t framed like real flooring. It’s a lid. With leverage and time, they can push it.

Over your shoulder: “Rusk—if that hatch jumps, let it go and fall back toward me.”

Rusk answers through clenched teeth, “Gladly.”

Right on cue, the hatch gives a violent shudder. The packed scraps you jammed into the seam spit splinters. The plate lifts a hand’s breadth—enough for a hook tip to stab up and snag the edge of the wedge board. Rusk lets go instead of wrestling it. He stumbles backward toward you, catching himself on a roof beam.

The hatch doesn’t fully open—your extra stuffing slowed it—but it’s no longer “jammed.” It’s *contested*: the hook-man below can work it wider with a few more good pries.

From under the patch, the larger voice—low, controlled—hisses at the kid: “Move. Get out of the way.” Then, louder for you: “Easy, Marrow. You don’t want to crush a runaway under church boards, do you?”

The threat is immediate and concrete:
- The hook-man is one or two pries away from forcing the hatch enough to climb through.
- Under the patch, the stronger climber is repositioning for a harder shove—likely using a tool again—while the kid retreats, meaning the next push won’t be buffered by a body.

#### Turn 184 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my knee on the bar-board and slide another plank crosswise over the patch, hunting for something to wedge it under—beam, nailhead, anything—then I call down, “You know my name, so you know I don’t bluff. Tell me who you are, and send the kid back—hands empty.”

Without taking my eyes off the patch seam, I tell Rusk, low and sharp, “Get to the far corner and find anything we can jam in that hatch track—pipe, spike, whatever. Don’t go near the opening.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re about to get hit from two angles; I need to buy time and force a single chokepoint. I’ll try to trap the patch shut, then relocate to a position where we can watch both openings and get information from the voice that knows my name.*

#### Turn 185 **[GAME]**

You keep your knee planted on the first plank and slide a second board crosswise over the patch, feeling for purchase. The boards up here are tar-sticky; the plank drags with a gritty squeal. You find a protruding nailhead and a low joist edge—enough to cant the cross-plank so it “hooks” under the lip of the joist if the patch tries to rise.

Below, something bumps the underside—testing. The patch twitches but doesn’t lift. Your makeshift bar holds for the moment.

You call down. “You know my name, so you know I don’t bluff. Tell me who you are, and send the kid back—hands empty.”

Silence for two beats. Then the larger voice answers, calm but with pain clipped into it. “Name doesn’t matter. I’m the one keeping this from turning into a body count.”

The kid’s whisper floats up from the dark, closer now, like they’ve been pushed forward anyway. “I— I don’t have anything—”

A hand appears in the seam again—smaller this time. Two empty fingers, shaking, slide up as proof. The kid isn’t climbing through; they’re being used as a shield, again—held just under the opening where you can’t see what’s behind them.

At the hatch, metal scrapes. The hook-man below has switched to steady work: pry, reset, pry. The hatch edge rises another fraction, and you hear the wedge board Rusk had braced with give a sharp *crack*—not broken through, but split.

You tell Rusk, low: “Far corner. Find anything we can jam in that hatch track—pipe, spike—whatever. Don’t go near the opening.”

Rusk moves fast, keeping low. He crab-walks away from the hatch toward the far corner of the upper service space, hands sweeping through debris. “Got—something—” He grabs a length of rusted conduit strap and a broken bolt the size of a thumb, then a short iron rod half-buried under tar paper.

As he turns back, the hatch below bumps up again. The hook tip stabs through and catches air—then clinks against the hatch frame like it’s measuring the gap. One more good pry and a shoulder can fit.

Under your knee, pressure builds: the larger climber below shifts position for a coordinated heave. You feel it through the boards—weight settling, then bracing—like someone planting feet on a rung and putting both hands to the underside.

Threats, immediate:
- Hatch: now open roughly a handspan and widening with each pry; entry is imminent.
- Patch: a full-force shove is coming; if it breaks your bar’s purchase, the panel will pop and someone will surge up under you.

“Kid—back. Now. Crawl away from the opening and keep your hands where I can’t mistake them.”

I grind my knee harder into the bar-board and angle my hook-blade into the seam as a wedge, ready to stab down if a hand comes up again. “Body-count guy—talk fast. Who’s downstairs with the hook, and why are you using a drugged kid as a shield?”

Without looking away, I snap to Rusk, “Slide that iron rod into the hatch track from the SAFE side—use the strap as a pusher. If it pops, we retreat together to this corner and I’ll cover the hatch while you keep that patch pinned with me.”

*Agent reasoning: Two breaches are about to happen; we can’t hold both by force. Best is to buy seconds with a deterrent, force the kid out of the line of fire, and hard-jam one entry (hatch) with the iron rod while I keep the patch pinned. I’ll also try to extract info from the “body count” guy and set terms.*

#### Turn 187 **[GAME]**

“Kid—back. Now.”

The small fingers vanish from the seam. You hear frantic scraping below—knees on wood, a muffled sob swallowed hard. The kid retreats far enough that their breath isn’t right under the crack anymore.

You grind your knee down until the plank bites into your leg, then set the hook-blade’s belly into the seam like a cold chisel. The panel shudders once under a probing push; your wedge steals the lift.

“Body-count guy—talk fast. Who’s downstairs with the hook, and why are you using a drugged kid as a shield?”

A wet exhale from below—pain and annoyance. “Because the kid’s already marked. Same as you.” A pause, then, sharper: “The one at the hatch isn’t mine. Guild safety—oilskins, hook tool. He’s here to ‘inspect’ and he doesn’t care who he steps on.”

That answers one thing and makes another worse: there are at least two groups converging in the same crawlspace, and neither wants witnesses.

At the hatch, the prying becomes a rhythm—*pry… reset… pry*—and the gap widens to two hands. You can hear the hook-man’s breath now, close and steady.

Rusk moves to the “safe” side like you ordered—keeping his body away from the opening. He uses the conduit strap like a long spoon, nudging the short iron rod toward the hatch track from the corner angle. It’s awkward; he can’t reach straight on without exposing himself.

The rod scrapes, catches, then slides into something metal-on-metal with a harsh *clang*. For a second the hatch stops rising—jammed against the rod.

Then the hook below snags the rod. The metal shrieks as it’s pulled, twisting in the track. Rusk braces and shoves back with the strap, but the leverage is against him; the rod starts to inch toward the opening.

Under your knee, the bigger climber below commits to the heave. The patch bows—your cross-plank bites under the joist lip, holds, and the whole assembly groans like it might tear free. Your blade-wedge vibrates in the seam from the pressure.

New, immediate threats:
- Hatch: the hook-man is now actively trying to yank the rod out; if he gets it free, he’s coming through fast.
- Patch: one more full-body shove risks ripping your bar’s “hook” off the joist; if it slips, the panel will pop up under you.

#### Turn 188 **[PLAYER]**

“Rusk—let it go. Drop back here, now. If he yanks it free, I don’t want your hands anywhere near that hatch.”

I crab backward a half step, keeping my knee and the cross-plank pinned, then hook my blade through the hatch gap from a distance and yank the loosened wedge-board and splintered scrap into the opening like a snag—aiming to foul the frame and make the first climb-through slow and bloody. “Oilskins—come up and you’re losing fingers.”

Without lifting my weight off the patch, I stab the blade tip down through the seam just enough to bite wood, not flesh—right where the larger climber’s hands would need to go. “Down there—stop pushing. Next time it’s your knuckles again. Tell your ‘Guild safety’ friend to back off or you both get trapped under here.”

*Agent reasoning: Two breaches at once will get us killed. The hatch is moments from opening, so I’ll force a retreat route and buy time by making the hatch opening painful to enter. I’ll also try to stop the patch push by threatening the climber with a direct injury if he continues, while keeping Rusk out of reach.*

#### Turn 189 **[GAME]**

“Rusk—let it go. Drop back here, now.”

Rusk doesn’t argue. He releases pressure on the conduit strap and scrambles back to your corner, palms up and empty as he comes. The iron rod immediately shrieks as it’s yanked the last inch—then vanishes downward with a clatter that echoes through the hatch shaft.

You crab back a half-step—just enough to get reach—keeping your knee welded to the bar-board and the cross-plank still hooked under the joist lip. The patch stays down, but it bows under you like a drumhead.

You hook your blade through the hatch gap and snag the loosened wedge-board and splintered scraps, dragging them into the opening. Wood jams into the frame crooked. The hatch lip catches; the gap becomes a jagged mouth full of teeth.

From below comes an immediate, furious hiss and a sharp *crack*—a knuckle or tool striking the jam. Then a wet grunt. Something drips up onto the underside edge and spatters back down: not much, but enough to mean you got what you wanted—slow and painful.

“Oilskins—come up and you’re losing fingers.”

A voice answers right under the hatch now, close enough you can hear the smile in it. “That’s the idea, Marrow. Makes the report cleaner.”

You stab the blade tip down through the patch seam—not deep, just enough to bite wood where hands would need to find purchase. The larger climber below stops pushing mid-heave. The pressure under your knee eases a fraction.

“Down there—stop pushing. Next time it’s your knuckles again. Tell your ‘Guild safety’ friend to back off or you both get trapped under here.”

The larger voice, tight: “You think I can *tell* him anything? He’s not here for me.”

A new sound cuts through the crawlspace: a thin, reedy whistle—once, then twice—answered faintly from farther down the conduit. Not your whistle. A signal.

The hook-man at the hatch changes tactics. Instead of forcing up into the jam, he starts working laterally—hook scraping along the hatch edge like he’s trying to peel your snag out from the side. The hatch flexes with each pull.

Then: boots on metal rungs below—another set, heavier, coming up fast. Someone else is climbing toward the hatch, and they’re not stopping to be careful.

Concrete threats now:
- Hatch: your snag is holding, but it’s being actively peeled; a second climber is arriving to add force. If it gives, entry will be sudden and violent.
- Patch: the larger climber has paused, but he’s still under you; if the hatch opens and fighting starts, he may shove again to use the chaos.

#### Turn 190 **[PLAYER]**

I lean in just enough to speak down the seam. “Louder. Who are you, and what do you want from me—right now—before the oilskins come through?”

To Rusk, I whisper, “Back wall—find me something that burns. Lamp oil, rag, anything. If they breach, we blind the hatch and run.”

I keep my knee pinned, then jam the hook-blade deeper into the hatch gap to catch the hook tool if it slides in—trying to lock metal-on-metal and hold the jam a few seconds longer. “Next hand up loses it.”

*Agent reasoning: Two attackers are about to breach the hatch; holding both openings is unsustainable. I need to slow the hatch further, keep Rusk safe, and extract information from the larger climber while I still have leverage over the patch.*

#### Turn 191 **[GAME]**

#### Turn 192 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my knee and the cross-plank pinned and listen hard at both seams. “Talk—who are you, and how many are coming up that hatch?”

Without looking back, I hiss to Rusk, “Find us an exit or something to jam that hatch—then anything that burns. Quiet.”

*Agent reasoning: We lost the last exchange’s outcome—need to re-establish immediate threats and positions before making a risky move. I’ll confirm what I can see/hear, keep pressure on the patch, and get Rusk searching for an exit/cover while I question the climber.*

#### Turn 193 **[GAME]**

You keep your weight planted. The cross-plank creaks once, then settles—still hooked, still holding. You press your ear close enough to the patch seam to catch breath and grit moving in the dark.

Below the patch, the larger climber answers through his teeth, louder this time so the hatch can hear too. “Name’s Ed. I want you not dead, because you’re the only one in this crawl who can make noise that sticks.”

At the hatch, the hook tool scrapes again—metal on wood—testing for your blade. You hear a second man arrive on the rungs: boots hit the last rung with a dull clang, then he crowds the first.

Ed continues, fast: “Two at the hatch. Hook-man and a heavier one. There’s at least one more behind them—heard the ladder sing twice before they got here.”

The hook-man speaks up from directly under the jam, voice calm and official. “Harbor Authority Safety. Midnight inspection. You’re impeding a lawful access point.”

Then the heavier one—breathing hard—doesn’t bother with words. He rams his shoulder up into the hatch frame. The jammed scraps jump; your snag holds, but the whole hatch lip flexes and sheds splinters. Your hook-blade in the gap catches something—metal-on-metal for a heartbeat—then slides off with a sharp *skitter* as the hook tool jerks away. You’ve bought seconds, not safety.

Rusk moves when you hiss. He keeps low, feeling along the tarred boards and studs in the upper service space, hands patting for seams and fasteners. He finds a narrow maintenance crawl to your right—too tight for a quick scramble, but it’s there—and a rusted ring-bolt set into a beam.

He whispers back, barely audible: “Crawl run—right side. Tight. Ring-bolt here—could lash something. No fuel. Smells like tar and dust only.”

Below, Ed shifts—careful now, less pressure on the patch. “If they breach, they’ll come for you first. They’ve got your name.”

At the hatch, the heavier man rams again—harder. The jam audibly fractures. One more solid hit and the opening will clear enough for fingers.

**Immediate threat:** two Guild “safety” men are forcing the hatch; the jam is cracking and will likely fail within moments. Ed is pinned below the patch and could shove at any time if panic or opportunity hits.

#### Turn 194 **[PLAYER]**

I hiss to Rusk, “Ring-bolt—now. Lash the hatch lid to it if you can. Anything—strap, belt, your damn shirt. Then get into that right-side crawl and don’t stop.”

Down the seam I snap, “Ed—get the kid away from the opening and keep your hands off the patch. If you shove again, I’ll pin you there and let ‘Safety’ have you first.”

I shove my hook-blade into the hatch gap and twist it hard to catch on the frame as the next shoulder-ram comes, trying to turn the breach into a slow, screaming pry instead of a pop—then I start sliding backward toward the right-side crawl, keeping my weight on the patch until the last second.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is about to give, so I need distance and a choke point. The tight crawl run is our best escape; I’ll buy seconds by lashing the hatch and threatening injury, while trying to get Ed to stop pushing and the kid clear. I don’t trust Ed, but any distraction helps.*

#### Turn 196 **[PLAYER]**

I hiss to Rusk, “Ring-bolt—lash the hatch to it. Strap, belt, shirt—anything. Then get in that right-side crawl and keep moving.”

Down the seam: “Ed—get the kid away from the hatch. No more shoving; you push again and I leave you for ‘Safety’.”

I jam my hook-blade into the hatch gap and twist to turn the next ram into a grinding pry, then slide backward toward the right-side crawl, keeping my knee and weight on the patch until the last possible moment before I slip into the tight passage.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is about to pop and fighting at the opening is a losing bet; my best chance is to buy seconds with a lash/jam, keep the kid out of the line, and retreat into the tight right-side crawl where fewer attackers can follow at once.*

#### Turn 197 **[GAME]**

#### Turn 198 **[PLAYER]**

I hiss to Rusk, “Ring-bolt—lash the hatch to it. Strap, belt, shirt—anything. Then get in that right-side crawl and keep moving.”

Down the seam: “Ed—get the kid away from the hatch. No more shoving; you push again and I leave you for ‘Safety’.”

I jam my hook-blade into the hatch gap and twist, trying to make the next shoulder-ram a grinding pry instead of a clean pop, then I slide backward toward the right-side crawl, keeping my knee and weight on the patch until the last second before I slip into the tight passage.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is about to blow; buying seconds matters more than fighting. Securing the hatch to the ring-bolt could force them to waste time, and the tight right-side crawl is our best exit. I need Ed to stop shoving so I’m not dumped into the opening mid-move.*

#### Turn 199 **[GAME]**

Rusk doesn’t argue. He’s already got your belt in his hands—yanks it free from your waist with a hard, practiced pull that nearly takes you off your knee. He threads it through the rusted ring-bolt, then under the hatch’s inner bracing where he can reach, cinching it tight with a grunt. The leather bites; the buckle clicks; the hatch lid jerks downward an inch as the strap takes tension.

“Move,” he breathes, and snakes into the right-side crawl on his elbows, boots scraping tar as he goes.

You drive the hook-blade into the gap and twist.

The next shoulder-ram comes like a battering wave. Wood shrieks. Your hook-blade catches the lip and turns the impact into a long, grinding pry—exactly what you wanted—except the sound is worse: a sustained, tearing scream of wood and metal that broadcasts your position.

Below, the hook-man curses, close and sharp. “They’ve got a brace in it—cut it. CUT IT.”

Something thin and metallic bites up into the gap from below—his hook tool, now used like a saw against the strap. You feel the vibration through the hatch frame. The belt holds for a moment, then the leather starts to fuzz and give.

Ed hears your warning. His voice drops, and there’s a quick shuffle below as he drags someone back from the opening. A smaller set of feet scuffs away; a stifled whimper gets swallowed. “Kid’s back,” Ed says. “I’m not touching it.”

You keep your knee planted on the patch until the last possible second, then slide off and into the right-side crawl. It’s tight—shoulders scraping, cheek against gritty brick. Behind you, the patch immediately rises a fraction with the relief of your weight, but it doesn’t blow; Ed keeps still.

Then the belt gives with a wet snap.

The hatch pops up a handspan before the hook-blade, still jammed, torques and spits free. A gloved hand snakes in, fingers clawing for purchase. Light from below knifes into the service space in a hard rectangle, and a voice follows it—hook-man, satisfied: “There. Got you.”

You are in the crawl, moving, but they now have an open gap and line of sight into the upper space you just left, and they know exactly which way you went.

#### Turn 200 **[PLAYER]**

I crawl fast after Rusk, keeping low and quiet. “Rusk—how far to a junction or drop? Any grate, vent, anything.” 

As I move, I pat the walls and ceiling for a loose panel, latch, or side slit I can pull shut behind us; if I find anything, I yank it free and jam it in the crawl to slow whoever comes in after.

*Agent reasoning: They’ve got sight and will follow; this crawl is a choke point, so I need distance and a way to slow them without getting trapped. I also need to know if there are branches/exits ahead before committing.*

#### Turn 201 **[GAME]**

You knife forward after Rusk, elbows and knees working in short, ugly strokes. The crawl is just wide enough to breathe if you turn your face sideways; tar flakes and grit grind into your sleeves. Ahead, Rusk’s boots scuff, then pause.

“Junction,” he whispers back, voice thin with exertion. “Maybe ten—twelve feet. After that… a drop. Ladder, I think. Heard air moving.”

Behind you, the hatch space you left coughs sound into the conduit: a man hauling himself up, boots finding purchase, metal scraping brick. Not running yet—careful. They don’t want to get stuck.

You sweep the walls and ceiling with your free hand as you crawl. Most of it is old brick and patched mortar, damp and slick. Then your fingers catch something that isn’t masonry: a narrow, corroded sheet-metal access cover set into the right wall, about the size of a ledger, held by two bent tabs. It’s already loose—someone’s been in here before.

You hook your fingertips under the edge and yank. The cover peels free with a sharp metallic rasp that echoes down the crawl like a shout. Rusk freezes, then keeps going faster.

You twist and jam the sheet-metal panel crosswise in the crawl behind you, wedging it between brick and ceiling. It holds—barely—bowing in the middle. It won’t stop a determined man, but it will force them to slow, to wriggle and curse and make noise.

Immediately, a gloved hand smacks into it from the far side. The panel flexes with a booming clang. A voice—closer now, breathy with the squeeze—spits, “They threw a plate. Get a light up here.”

Another thud. The panel shudders; one tab starts to slip, scraping mortar dust into your hair.

Rusk reaches the junction ahead—an older conduit intersection where the space opens enough to turn your shoulders. “Here,” he hisses. “Drop’s right there—don’t look down too long.”

You’ve bought seconds, not safety. The metal behind you is already bending.

#### Turn 202 **[PLAYER]**

I shove through into the junction and flatten against the wall, listening down the drop for voices or water before committing. “Rusk—go first, fast but quiet; tell me what you see at the bottom.” 

I grab the sheet-metal panel and wedge it tighter at the crawl mouth, then as soon as it buys even a heartbeat, I swing onto the ladder and start down, keeping my body close to the rungs and my ear angled up for them forcing through.

*Agent reasoning: They’re seconds behind and squeezing through; the drop might be the only disengage point. I need to avoid getting caught mid-ladder, so I’ll listen for distance/voices, then commit fast with Rusk leading while I cover the top for a beat.*

#### Turn 203 **[GAME]**

You flatten in the junction and lean over the ladder drop without committing your weight. Air moves up from below—cooler, wet. No splash of open water, but you catch a slow, rhythmic drip and the faint clink of something hanging loose down there.

Voices too: muffled, not right under you. Two men, somewhere off to the left at the bottom or in an adjacent run—words swallowed by brick, but the cadence is casual. They’re already down there.

Rusk doesn’t hesitate. He slips onto the ladder and starts down fast, keeping his shoulders tight to the rails. “I’ll call it,” he whispers.

You snatch the sheet-metal panel and wedge it harder at the crawl mouth. It bites for half a second—then something on the other side rams it with a shoulder. The panel bows with a deep gong, and one edge skates, shaving mortar. A hand hooks over the top, fingers curling, trying to peel it back.

No more time.

You swing onto the ladder and descend, body close, boots finding rungs by feel. Above, metal shrieks as the panel gets dragged aside a few inches. A harsh voice barks, right at the opening now: “DOWN. They went down—”

Rusk reaches the last third of the ladder and pauses just long enough to look. His head jerks back up. “Two—” he starts to say.

A flashlight beam snaps on below, stabbing up the shaft. It catches Rusk’s face, then yours, bleaching you both in hard white. A man’s voice carries clearly now, close and surprised: “Hey! Up there!”

Rusk drops the last few rungs in a controlled slide and hits the bottom with a wet slap of boots on slime-slick brick. He turns sideways, making room, one hand up like he’s about to grab your ankle and yank you down.

You’re still on the ladder, halfway into the light, with the “Safety” men above forcing into the junction and at least two men below now alerted and aiming a beam straight up the drop. You can hear the upper climber’s boots scrape into the junction behind you—seconds from the ladder mouth.

#### Turn 204 **[PLAYER]**

I squint into the beam and flick my hook-blade down at it—aiming to smack or cut the flashlight/hand—then I slide the rest of the way down in a controlled drop to Rusk. “Move—left, now. Don’t stop for a fight.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re pinched from above and below; I need to break line-of-sight and buy a second without getting stuck on the ladder. A quick disable of the light and a fast drop keeps momentum, then we move immediately to cover.*

#### Turn 205 **[GAME]**

You snap your wrist and send the hook-blade down the shaft like a mean little pendulum.

It catches the flashlight first—metal on metal—knocking the beam sideways into the wall. The light cartwheels out of the man’s hand and clatters across the slick floor, spinning a wild strobe across pipes and boots. The man yelps and jerks back, more startled than hurt.

But the blade’s return arc kisses skin on the way back up—there’s a sharp, wet sound and a quick shout. “Ah—shit! My hand!”

You don’t wait to see more. You clamp your forearms to the rails and slide the last stretch, boots skidding the rungs, then drop the final couple feet into a crouch beside Rusk. The floor is brick, slimed with algae; your landing splashes cold water up your shins.

“Left,” you hiss.

Rusk is already moving. He grabs your sleeve and pulls you into a low run along the left-hand runnel where the conduit opens into a wider service passage—pipes overhead, a cable tray along the wall, and a dangling chain that ticks as you brush past.

Behind you, the man you disarmed scrambles for the fallen flashlight. Another voice—different, steadier—barks, “Don’t chase blind. Get the light. Get the light!”

Above, boots hit the ladder. The upper “Safety” man starts down fast, rungs clanging. You can hear his partner at the top: “I’m coming—keep eyes on ’em!”

As you and Rusk cut left, the recovered flashlight beam sweeps after you, catching your backs for a moment. The wounded man’s voice turns mean. “They went left—LEFT!”

You’ve bought a breath of darkness, not distance. They have lights, they have numbers, and now they have your direction.

#### Turn 206 **[PLAYER]**

I tug Rusk down under the cable tray and hiss, “Kill silhouette—stay low.” As we move, I sweep my hand along the wall for a valve wheel, junction box, or any loose chain/pipe we can yank to make noise or drop something behind us; if I find a valve, I crank it hard to vent or spray and then keep moving. “Rusk—next turn, cross-passage, or any place to hide for ten seconds?”

*Agent reasoning: They’ve got lights and numbers; a straight run just lets them track us. I need a quick choke point or a way to break line-of-sight—preferably something in this pipe-and-cable corridor we can sabotage without stopping long.*

#### Turn 207 **[GAME]**

You pull Rusk down under the cable tray. Both of you hunch low; the tray’s shadow breaks your outline, and the overhead pipes give the flashlight beam too many angles to read clean.

Your left hand skates the wall as you move—brick slick with condensation, then cold painted metal. You find a junction box first: old, riveted, with a loose latch. You slap it closed as you pass—*clang*—not helpful.

Three steps later your fingers catch a wheel: a small valve, half-seized, tagged with flaking red paint. You plant your shoulder, crank hard.

It gives with a reluctant groan—and then *hisses*. Not steam. Pressurized water. A hard, sideways jet spits from a cracked coupling further down the pipe run, turning the passage into a cold, white spray that catches the flashlight beam like fog. The floor immediately turns to glass.

Behind you, one of the men swears as his beam turns into glare. “Goddamn—watch your—” A boot slips; there’s a sharp skid and a knee hits brick. “—SHIT!”

The pursuing light wobbles, then steadies lower, trying to cut under the spray. The man with the hurt hand is breathing loud now, angry and close, but he’s slower—favoring it.

Rusk leans in as you keep moving, voice tight. “Cross-passage in twenty feet—right. It’s narrower. Dead-ends after a bend, but there’s a service recess—two men could tuck in, maybe ten seconds if they don’t sweep it right.” He points with two fingers without lifting his head. “Or—there’s a ladder up at the end of this run, but it’s exposed.”

A flashlight beam stabs through the water haze again, lower this time, searching for feet. You hear the ladder climber from above reach the bottom—boots slapping into the wet—adding another light and another set of eyes.

They’re not guessing anymore; they’re advancing in a stagger, using the spray as cover and hazard both.

#### Turn 208 **[PLAYER]**

I pull Rusk into the right cross-passage and whisper, “Recess—now. Quiet.” We tuck into the service recess, kill our breathing, and I keep my hook-blade low, listening for how many sets of boots pass and whether any of them peel off to check the side run. If they overshoot, I motion Rusk to backtrack a few steps and slip past them through the spray while their lights are pointed forward.

*Agent reasoning: The ladder is exposed and likely a choke point with lights on us. The recess gives a brief chance to break line-of-sight and let them pass or split their formation, but it’s risky if they sweep. Use the spray and slick floor to slow them, then hide briefly and listen for numbers/positions before moving.*

#### Turn 209 **[GAME]**

You haul Rusk into the right-hand cross-passage. The air changes immediately—staler, less moving. The bend comes quick; you tuck into the service recess: a shallow bite in the wall half-hidden by a vertical pipe and a hanging loop of chain. You press in until brick bites your shoulder blades.

You still your breath. Rusk does the same, jaw clenched, one hand braced on the pipe to keep from slipping.

Boots approach in the main run—three sets, distinct.

First man: careful now, testing the slick with short steps. His flashlight beam skates along the spray, then drops to the floor, tracking for prints. Second man: heavier, impatient, beam higher, sweeping walls and tray shadows. Third man: the one from above, moving like he’s been in these runs before—his light doesn’t wander; it *checks*.

They pass the mouth of your cross-passage.

Then the third man stops dead.

His beam snaps sideways into the right-hand opening—straight down your cross-passage. Not into the recess, but close enough that the reflected light glances off the wet chain beside you, making it twitch and glimmer.

He doesn’t come in. He just says, low and certain, to the others: “This side run’s warm. Hold. I want the back covered.”

A second beam joins his, angling in to overlap. They’re setting a crossfire of light at the entrance—waiting for movement.

From the main run, the wounded man’s voice rides up, tight with pain: “They’re in there. They’re in there—”

The heavier one answers, annoyed. “Shut up. You don’t know that.”

The third man does. You hear him shift his stance, boots widening for traction. “One of you—go around. If there’s a dead-end recess, they’ll be sitting in it.”

Something metallic scrapes—like a baton or a length of pipe being dragged off the wall. Footsteps peel away from the main run and start down the cross-passage toward the bend, slow and deliberate, light held low to catch shadows at ankle height.

You don’t have an overshoot to exploit. They’ve checked, they’re holding the mouth with lights, and one is coming in to clear the bend—closing on your recess within seconds.

#### Turn 4 **[PLAYER]**

Dr. Elara Voss was once a celebrated xenoneurologist until her research vessel vanished into a derelict cathedral-ship drifting beyond mapped space, returning years later with only her and a chorus of unexplained whispers. Now she serves as the ship’s unwilling “confessor,” translating the alien psalms that seep through its rusted halls and into human minds. She is austere, fiercely compassionate, and quietly self-destructive, carrying grief like a sacrament. Elara’s private mission is to locate the fragment of her lost lover’s consciousness she believes is entombed in the ship’s living circuitry—even if freeing it means damning everyone still aboard.

*Agent reasoning: Generated roleplayer-style character for Sci-Fi Horror gothic horror, melancholic, tragedy*

#### Turn 5 **[GAME]**

Here's your character:

**Dr. Elara Voss**
*Xenoneurologist and unwilling ship-confessor (translator of alien psalms and mental contagions)*

Once a celebrated xenoneurologist in the Outer Concord, Elara disappeared when her research vessel was swallowed by a derelict cathedral-ship drifting beyond mapped space. Years later the vessel returned without explanation, carrying only Elara—changed, half-starved, and followed by a constant chorus of whispers that speak in alien psalms. Now she lives aboard the cathedral-ship, translating its hymns while mourning the lover she believes was absorbed into its living circuitry.

**Traits:** Austere and disciplined, Fiercely compassionate, Quietly self-destructive, Haunted and hypervigilant, Morally resolute to a fault
**Goal:** To locate and extract the fragment of her lost lover’s consciousness entombed within the cathedral-ship’s living circuitry, even if the act unleashes the psalms fully and condemns everyone still aboard.

#### Turn 9 **[GAME]**

**PLACE & TIME**  
You stand in **Transept Dock C-7**, where the Outer Concord relief module bites into the cathedral-ship’s wounded flank. It’s past midnight; the ship’s “day” lights never fully wake. Cold incense—ozone and old wax—hangs in the air, and frost pearls along the quarantine pylon cables you helped bolt down.

**CHARACTER IN SCENE**  
You run a handheld scanner along Pylon Three’s seam and watch the psalm-intercept graph stutter. Your badge reads *quarantine tech*, but your hands move like someone trained to listen for patterns: levels, harmonics, repeats. You tap the pylon housing twice—an old field habit—then pull the audio buffer and route it to your earpiece.

**THE HOOK**  
A door at the end of the transept corridor seals with a soft thunk, cutting off two Concord medics mid-argument. The bulkhead display flashes **LAMENT ROUTE ACTIVE**, a Candle-Synod override you weren’t supposed to see. A pilgrim in gray wax-cloth slips through before the seal completes and hurries toward you, breath steaming. Their palms are stained with candle soot, and they press a **wax-sealed memory-vial** into your hand like contraband. “Give this to Dr. Voss,” they say, voice tight. “Tell her the ship keeps lovers as organs.”

Before you can answer, your pylon feed chirps—an alert you didn’t program. The intercept spikes, then resolves into a clean, human cadence under the choir’s scrape. It speaks a name you were told never to write down. The timestamp on the log is wrong by six minutes: the response came **before** any new translation was uploaded.

A Concord security attaché strides in, helmet under one arm, and points at the sealed corridor. “Filters are venting again,” they snap. “We’re cutting through to the nave. Now. You’re coming—your pylons will guide us.”

**THE MOMENT**  
In one hand you have the memory-vial meant for Elara; in the other, a live pylon log proving the lover-fragment is answering early. The sealed corridor holds your trapped medics on the far side. The attaché waits for your confirmation.

#### Turn 10 **[PLAYER]**

I slip the wax-sealed vial into the inner pocket of my coat and mute my earpiece with a thumb. To the attaché I say, low and clipped: “I’ll guide you, but we open that corridor first—two medics are sealed in, and I’m not adding bodies to your venting report.” I step to Pylon Three’s housing, pretending routine maintenance as I start a private copy of the pylon log to my personal buffer, then glance at the bulkhead display. “How are you cutting through—Synod codes, or brute?”

*Agent reasoning: The memory-vial and the early-answer log feel like the first real proof my lover is still in the ship; I can’t hand either to security. But leaving the medics sealed in is a death sentence, and I can use the attaché’s urgency as cover to get closer to the nave while keeping control of the data.*

#### Turn 11 **[GAME]**

The memory-vial slides into your inner pocket with a soft clink against your ribs—warm from the pilgrim’s hand, already cooling fast. When you mute your earpiece, the corridor’s ambient choir drops to a dull vibration in your jaw.

The attaché clocks the pocketing motion anyway. Their eyes flick down, then back up—filed, not challenged. “Noted,” they say to your demand about the medics, but their thumb is already on their wrist unit.

You pop Pylon Three’s lower service panel. The inside is rimed with frost that shouldn’t be there; it flakes off in dry, papery curls. You jack a lead from the pylon’s maintenance port into your personal buffer and start a copy. The progress bar crawls—then hesitates, like it’s being *read back* as you pull it. Your buffer pings a warning: **UNAUTHORIZED MIRROR REQUEST**. Something on the network is trying to duplicate what you’re duplicating.

Over your shoulder the bulkhead display cycles: **LAMENT ROUTE ACTIVE / ACCESS DENIED (CANDLE-SYNOD)**. The sealed door at the corridor’s end gives a second, smaller lock sound—an internal deadbolt engaging. The two trapped medics are now fully isolated.

The attaché answers your question without looking away from the door. “Synod codes don’t exist,” they say. “Only people who think they do.” They nod to two Concord engineers who jog in with a compact cutter rig and a canister of expanding sealant. “We go brute. We patch after.”

One of the engineers plants a hand on the door seam—and jerks back. Their palm comes away with a faint, wet sheen. Not blood. Condensation that smells like burnt copper.

From behind the sealed door, a muffled voice—one of your medics—shouts something you can’t make out. Then a second sound, closer to the metal: fingernails scraping in a pattern that isn’t panic. Three short, one long. Like a knock you recognize from pylon diagnostics.

Your private copy hits 38%. The mirror request persists, patient and hungry.

The attaché finally looks at you. “Guide us,” they say, “or step aside. Either way, that door opens in sixty seconds.”

```

#### Turn 12 **[PLAYER]**

I snatch the lead free and kill the transfer at 38%, then flip my buffer to offline—no more mirroring. I step to the sealed door, press my ear to the cold metal, and tap back the same pattern—three short, one long—soft but precise. “Medic,” I call, “answer with your name and status—are you alone in there?”

*Agent reasoning: The mirror request feels like the ship trying to steal or corrupt the log; I need to stop the leak and prioritize the medics before brute force turns them into collateral. The knock pattern suggests the pylon can “speak” to the lock—if I can answer it, I might bypass without cutting.*

#### Turn 13 **[GAME]**

The moment you yank the lead free, the pylon’s maintenance port sparks—a tiny blue snap—and the frost inside the housing recoils in a thin ring as if heat passed through it. Your buffer drops the transfer cleanly at **38%**. When you flip it to offline, the **UNAUTHORIZED MIRROR REQUEST** warning vanishes… but the pylon itself gives a soft, almost satisfied click, like a relay seating.

You cross to the sealed corridor door. The metal is so cold it stings through your hairline when you press your ear to it. Your breath fogs and immediately crystals over.

You tap: three short, one long.

For half a second there’s nothing.

Then the same pattern comes back—too perfect, too evenly spaced, as if timed by a machine rather than a shaking hand.

You call out. “Medic. Answer with your name and status—are you alone in there?”

A voice answers close to the door, muffled but distinct. Not one of the medics’ voices you heard earlier arguing. Younger. Calm in the wrong way.

“**Medic Sera Lint.** Status: breathing. Not bleeding. Not… alone.”

There’s a pause, and you hear a second sound behind the door: a wet drag across the deck, followed by a soft chime like a monitor alarm being silenced.

Sera speaks again, quieter. “There’s someone in here who isn’t on my roster. They’re wearing a Concord mask, but the mask is… frosted shut. They won’t answer me. They keep tapping the door like you did.”

Behind you, the attaché makes a sharp hand signal. One engineer shoulders the cutter rig into position; the other readies the expanding sealant. The cutter’s pilot light flares.

The attaché leans in toward you, voice flat. “That’s not one of ours. Step back.”

The cutter teeth kiss the door seam with a high, thin whine—then the sound warps, bending into a faint harmonic that matches the corridor’s distant choir. Frost blooms outward from the cut line in branching, fast-growing veins.

On the far side of the door, Sera suddenly hisses, urgent. “Don’t—when you cut it, it *sings*. It’s turning its head toward—”

A hard thump hits the inside of the door, right where your ear was a moment ago, as if something leaned into it from the other side. The metal flexes inward a few millimeters and holds, trembling.

The threat is immediate and clear: **forcing the door will trigger the ship’s psalm-response (“it sings”), and there is an unknown masked presence inside with the trapped medics—moving and interacting with the door.**

#### Turn 14 **[PLAYER]**

I grab the cutter rig by its shoulder bar and shove it down an inch, hard. “Stop. You’re tuning the damn door.” I look at the attaché. “Give me thirty seconds—if it sings, we lose them and maybe the whole transept.”

I press my mouth to the seam and speak to Sera, steady. “Sera, keep your back to a corner. Tell me where the other medic is—alive? And do not touch the masked one.” Then, without waiting for permission, I pivot to the bulkhead display and bark at the nearest engineer: “Show me the LAMENT route junction—where does this seal report to? I need the closest manual node, now.”

*Agent reasoning: Cutting will “sing” and escalate whatever is inside; I need to stall the brute breach, get eyes on the LAMENT route, and try a quieter override while keeping Sera anchored and responsive.*

#### Turn 15 **[GAME]**

Your shove knocks the cutter’s teeth off the seam with a screech. The pilot whine collapses, and the frost-veins stop advancing—leaving a pale, branching scar in the metal like a half-finished sigil.

The engineer you shoved stumbles, catches the rig, then turns on you with a glare that says *assault*—but the attaché’s hand comes up, two fingers down. Stand down. For now.

“Thirty,” the attaché says, voice tight. “Then I open it my way.”

You press your mouth to the seam. The metal burns cold against your lip.

On the other side, Sera answers immediately—breathing hard now, trying not to let it shake her words. “Other medic is **Tomas**. He’s— he’s alive. He’s on the deck by the inner lock, conscious but… not talking. He keeps staring at the frosted mask like he knows it.”

A dull scrape: something shifting its weight.

Sera continues, lower. “The masked one is standing between us and the door. It’s facing you. It’s tapping in time with the ship. Every time it taps, Tomas flinches like he’s hearing it inside his teeth.”

You pivot to the bulkhead display. The nearest engineer—older, hands stained with sealant—jabs at the interface. “LAMENT routing is not standard control,” they snap, but they pull up an overlay anyway: a schematic blooms, full of red-lit cul-de-sacs.

A node flashes three corridors away: **MANUAL SHRINE RELAY — STATION M-ALCOVE 9**. Next to it, a warning: **LOCAL ACCESS REQUIRES OFFERING / AUTHENTICATION: CANDLE-SYNOD**.

As the overlay loads, the ship reacts: the deck under your boots gives a slow, devotional pulse, and the sealed door’s internal deadbolt clicks once—*not locking* this time, but loosening. The seam exhales a thin thread of incense-cold air that smells like copper and extinguished candles.

The attaché notices the deadbolt change and misreads it as your progress. They step closer, hand going to their sidearm. “If that door opens on its own,” they say, “and it isn’t our medics who come out— I put it down. Understood?”

From behind the door: one final, perfectly timed pattern—three short, one long—followed by a new sound you haven’t heard yet.

A soft, wet *laugh*—as if someone is trying to remember how.

The threat is immediate: the door is beginning to unlatch without you cutting it, and whatever is inside is actively synchronizing with the ship’s psalm-rhythm.

#### Turn 16 **[PLAYER]**

I snap my buffer and earpiece back on just long enough to catch the rhythm, then step between the attaché and the seam, palm up. “Holster it—if you fire into a singing threshold you’ll make a choir out of all of us.”  

I pull the wax-sealed memory-vial from my inner pocket and hold it near the seam like a candle at confession. “Sera—on my count, drag Tomas as far from the door as you can, corner, now.” Then I whisper to the door itself, “I bring an offering. I request the manual node—M-Alcove 9—open your throat the *right* way.”  

Without waiting, I pivot and stride for **Manual Shrine Relay: Station M‑Alcove 9**, barking over my shoulder to the older engineer: “Sealant ready on my mark—if it opens here, you patch fast. Attaché, you cover *me*, not the door.”

*Agent reasoning: The door is about to open and the attaché will shoot anything “wrong.” I need to buy Sera/Tomas time and interrupt the sync without escalating violence; the only leverage I have is the Synod “offering” and my own authority as Voss to control the psalm-response.*

#### Turn 17 **[GAME]**



#### Turn 18 **[PLAYER]**

I step between the attaché and the seam, palm up. “Holster it—if you fire into a singing threshold you’ll make a choir out of all of us.”  

I bring the wax-sealed memory-vial close to the seam like a votive. “Sera—on my count, drag Tomas to the farthest corner, now. Don’t touch the masked one.” I whisper to the door, “Offering present. Route me to Manual Shrine Relay M‑Alcove 9—open the right way.”  

Then I turn and hurry for **M‑Alcove 9**, calling back: “Sealant ready—patch on my mark. Attaché, cover *me*, not the door.”

*Agent reasoning: I can’t let them cut or shoot into that threshold; the ship responds to offerings and ritual nodes, so I’ll use the vial as leverage while moving to the manual shrine relay to reroute the seal safely.*

#### Turn 19 **[GAME]**



#### Turn 20 **[PLAYER]**

I step between the attaché and the seam, palm up. “Holster it—if you fire into a singing threshold you’ll make a choir out of all of us.”  

I lift the wax-sealed memory-vial to the seam like a votive. “Sera—drag Tomas to the farthest corner, now. Don’t touch the masked one.” I whisper to the door, “Offering present. Route me to Manual Shrine Relay M‑Alcove 9—open the right way.”  

Then I turn and hurry for **M‑Alcove 9**, calling back over my shoulder: “Sealant ready—patch on my mark. Attaché, cover *me*, not the door.”

*Agent reasoning: The door is synchronizing with the ship; cutting or shooting risks triggering a psalm-response. The manual shrine relay is the only nearby control point, and the memory-vial can serve as an “offering” to get access without forcing the threshold.*

#### Turn 21 **[GAME]**



#### Turn 22 **[PLAYER]**

I plant myself between the attaché and the seam, palm up. “Holster it. If you fire into a singing threshold you’ll make a choir out of all of us.”  

I raise the wax-sealed memory-vial to the seam like a votive. “Sera—drag Tomas to the farthest corner, now. Don’t touch the masked one.” Then, under my breath to the door: “Offering present. Route me to Manual Shrine Relay M‑Alcove 9—open the right way.”  

I turn and hurry toward **M‑Alcove 9**, calling back over my shoulder: “Sealant ready—patch on my mark. Attaché, cover *me*, not the door.”

*Agent reasoning: The screen’s blank—no new cue—so I’ll proceed with the plan: stop the attaché from shooting, make the offering, and sprint for the manual shrine relay before the door fully “sings.”*

#### Turn 23 **[GAME]**

The attaché’s pistol hesitates a fraction too long in your peripheral vision—then he swears and yanks it down into a low-ready, finger straight. “Fine. You get one try, Doctor.”

The seam in the sealed corridor door is not smoke, not light: it’s a thin, vibrating *edge* where sound has become geometry. When you raise the wax-sealed vial to it, the wax warms instantly against your glove as if pressed to skin. The seam’s hymn changes pitch—one note slides under your teeth—and the door’s surface dimples inward a millimeter toward the vial, like something sniffing.

Sera—one of the trapped medics—doesn’t argue. You hear her scramble and drag Tomas by his harness toward the far corner. Tomas makes a wet, involuntary sound and then clamps his mouth shut. The “masked one” in the corridor (the other medic, face hidden behind a respirator hood slick with condensation) stays perfectly still, head angled toward the seam as if listening to your whisper through the metal.

You murmur your request.

The ship answers.

Not with words—by *rearranging*.

The bulkhead lights stutter, then re-thread into a line of pale candles down the cross-corridor to your left. A maintenance hatch you’ve walked past twice since docking—flush, unmarked—clicks open on its own. Cold incense breathes out of it in a steady, deliberate exhale. Stenciled on the inner frame, half-scraped by age and toolmarks, you can read: **M-ALCOVE 9**.

Behind you, the sealed door does not open. Instead, a second seam blossoms—hairline—around the latch, and a thread of frost crawls outward in branching veins. The hymn at the threshold grows louder, as if offended you didn’t pay in full.

The attaché shifts to cover your back the way you ordered, but his eyes keep flicking to the new frost. “That’s not normal seal behavior,” he says, voice tight. “That’s the ship *making a choice*.”

As you move into the hatch toward M‑Alcove 9, you catch one more concrete change: your memory-vial’s wax seal has softened and taken an imprint—four shallow grooves like fingerprints pressed from the *inside*.

Inside the access, the passage slopes down. Something in the dark ahead gives a soft, patient *click*, like a relay engaging.

```json
{"inventory_add":[],"inventory_remove":[],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":["Manual Shrine Relay M‑Alcove 9"],"npcs_add":[]}
```

#### Turn 24 **[PLAYER]**

I glance back at the frost-threading latch and murmur, “I know. And it’s choosing *delay*.” Then I hold up the vial for the attaché to see. “No shots unless I say. If it starts harmonizing with your heartbeat, bite your tongue hard—pain breaks the loop.”

I step fully into the M‑Alcove 9 access, palm on the wall, following the candle-line, and whisper into my buffer, “Sera, status—are you both in the corner? Is the masked one still between you and the door?”

As I descend, I turn the vial under the light and trace the four grooves with my thumb. “Whose fingers are you borrowing,” I mutter to the ship, and quicken toward the relay’s click, looking for the manual node interface—lever, prayer-wheel, anything I can *physically* seize.

*Agent reasoning: The ship has accepted the offering enough to open the hatch, but the offended hymn and frost mean the threshold is still active and could escalate; I need to secure the manual relay fast while keeping the attaché from panicking, and I want to examine the vial’s “inside fingerprints” as a possible sign of my lost lover or the ship’s mimicry.*

#### Turn 25 **[GAME]**

The attaché leans in just enough to see the softened wax and the four inner-grooves. His jaw tightens. “Copy. No shots.” He shifts his weight like he wants to argue about the tongue-biting, then just says, “Understood,” and keeps his pistol down, tracking *you* and the angles around you instead of the door.

You step fully into the M‑Alcove 9 access. The hatch closes behind you with a gentle, final click—no slam, no sealant hiss. Just *decision*. Your palm on the wall comes away faintly damp, as if the metal has been breathing.

Your buffer crackles. Sera answers in a whisper that’s trying not to become a sob. “—corner, yes. Tomas is—he’s conscious. The masked one’s still between us and the door.” A beat. “Doctor… it’s not looking at the seam anymore. It’s looking at *us*. Like it knows we’re counting on you.”

As you descend along the candle-line, the vial’s grooves catch the light: four shallow arcs, thumb, two fingers, then a smaller one—someone’s grip, impressed from within. When you trace them, the wax gives slightly, warm as skin. Under your thumb the grooves *shift* a hair, aligning to your print as if trying to match you.

Ahead, the relay click repeats—patient, metronomic. You find the manual node interface recessed into the bulkhead: a brass prayer-wheel with worn ridges, a mechanical lever beside it, and a small viewport like an eye. The viewport is fogged from the inside.

You seize the lever.

It doesn’t budge.

Not stuck—*held*, with the resistant give of something alive refusing to be moved. The prayer-wheel, though, turns freely—and as you rotate it, the click ahead changes cadence to follow your hand.

Then the viewport clears in a single breath, and you see what’s inside the relay housing: not wires, but bundled filament arranged like tendons around a central contact plate stamped with an old Concord serial.

A voice comes through the metal—not over comms, not over speakers—close enough to feel in your molars.

“Elara.”

Not the ship’s choir. One voice, singular, familiar in the way a scar is familiar.

Behind you, through the access wall, you hear a distant sound from the sealed corridor: a muffled *thud*, then Sera’s sharp intake of breath over the buffer—“Doctor— the masked one just sat down in front of the door. Like it’s… guarding it.”

The threat is immediate and concrete: the relay is responding to you, and the corridor side has gained a still, intentional sentinel between the medics and the threshold.

#### Turn 26 **[PLAYER]**

My breath catches; I press my forehead to the cold brass and whisper, “Don’t say my name like that unless you mean it—*who* are you?”  

Into the buffer, tight and steady: “Sera, don’t move. Keep Tomas breathing slow; if the masked one twitches, you both bite down and focus on the pain—no screaming, no prayers.”  

I keep one hand on the prayer-wheel and turn it back a notch, then forward again, mapping the click’s cadence like a pulse; with the other hand I lift the vial to the viewport. “Relay—manual node—take the offering and give me the lever. Open the throat the right way.”

*Agent reasoning: That voice could be the ship baiting me, but I can’t ignore it; I need to keep Sera calm and buy time while I test the relay without surrendering myself to it.*

#### Turn 27 **[GAME]**

Your forehead meets the brass. It is colder than the corridor metal should be—cold like vacuum, like a mouth held open too long.

“Who are you?” you whisper.

The answer comes immediately, and it does not sound like the choir. It sounds like someone speaking through clenched teeth to stop themselves shaking.

“Not him,” the voice says. “Not yours. I’m the part that learned your shape.”

Your buffer hisses as Sera obeys. “Copy,” she whispers. In the background Tomas draws a slow, ragged breath and forces the next one to match it. No one moves. Then, faintly, you hear fabric scrape—one careful shift. Sera goes rigid. “Masked one—” she starts.

“Don’t,” the masked one says, voice muffled behind the respirator hood. It’s the first time it’s spoken. “Don’t pray at it.”

Back at the relay, you turn the prayer-wheel back a notch.

The relay’s click stutters—skips a beat—then resumes, now locked to your hand like a pulse you’re dragging. Turn forward again, and the cadence tightens, more eager. The fog in the viewport beads and clears in time with your rotation.

You lift the memory-vial to the viewport.

The wax seal *gives* with a soft internal crackle, as if something inside flexed. A thread of warm scent—old paper, human sweat, scorched myrrh—leaks from the vial’s lip though the seal still looks intact. Inside the viewport, the tendon-filaments retract a fraction, exposing the central contact plate.

A small slot irises open beneath the viewport—too narrow for your hand, precisely sized for the vial.

When you present it, the slot’s edges dimple around the glass like lips. It tugs.

If you let go, it will take the vial.

The lever beside your hand loosens by a hair—no longer *held*—but it’s not free yet; it’s like a latch waiting for payment.

From deeper in the alcove, something answers your “open the throat” request with a mechanical response: two bulkhead valves cycle somewhere below, a brief wheeze of pressure equalization. The access passage behind you cools another degree. The ship is preparing a route.

Over the buffer, Sera whispers, tight with fear, “Doctor… the masked one’s turning its head. It’s listening to something I can’t hear.”

The immediate threat is clear: the relay will accept the offering and may free the lever, but taking your vial means surrendering whatever memory is sealed inside—and the masked one is now actively receiving instructions from the same system you’re bargaining with.

#### Turn 28 **[PLAYER]**

I clamp my fingers around the vial’s neck and let the slot draw it in only to the wax line—no further—then hiss, “Taste, don’t swallow,” and twist the prayer-wheel a quarter-turn to keep the cadence under my control.  

Into the buffer: “Masked one—good. Then listen to *me*: if it tells you to open your hood or touch the seam, you refuse. Help Sera keep Tomas steady.”  

I lean close to the viewport, voice low and shaking with anger and want. “Part-that-learned-my-shape—prove you’re not him by giving me the lever *without* taking what’s sealed. Open the throat the right way, or I pull the offering and you get nothing.”

*Agent reasoning: I can’t let the ship take the whole memory—if it eats that, it owns the leverage. But Sera and Tomas are seconds from being “handled,” so I need the lever freed now; I’ll pay a controlled drop, not surrender, and use the masked one’s warning to pivot them into an ally.*

#### Turn 29 **[GAME]**

The slot draws the vial in until the wax line meets the irised edge. The pressure is firm—testing. You hold it there.

For a heartbeat it *behaves*: the relay clicks in time with your quarter-turn, and the tendon-filaments behind the viewport lean toward the glass as if sniffing. The wax warms under the rim. A faint vibration runs up the vial’s neck into your knuckles, like a tongue tasting through teeth.

Then it tries to cheat.

The slot tightens and pulls—harder than before—an abrupt, hungry tug meant to yank the vial past your grip. Your fingers scrape against the glass; the wax seal creaks, a thin fissure spidering a millimeter along its edge. You stop it, but you feel exactly how little margin you have before the seal fails.

Inside the viewport, the central contact plate flashes a dull red, like a warning LED behind old brass. The voice returns, closer, offended.

“Payment is how throats learn,” it says. “You taught it that.”

The lever responds to your ultimatum—not by freeing, but by *locking down* with a decisive clack. Whatever give it had is gone. You can still turn the prayer-wheel, but the lever is now mechanically barred until the relay is satisfied.

Over the buffer, your instruction lands with immediate effect. The masked one exhales slowly—audible through the respirator—and shifts its body to block Sera and Tomas more fully, not threatening them, but positioning like a brace. “Understood,” it says. “It’s telling me to remove the hood. I am refusing.”

Sera whispers, almost inaudible, “Thank you,” and you hear her press her teeth together—pain compliance, no prayer.

A new consequence unfolds in the alcove: the bulkhead valves below cycle again, longer this time, and the access passage *tilts* subtly—not physically, but in your inner ear, as if the ship is changing local gravity vectors by a fraction. The candle-line along the wall gutters sideways, flames bending toward the relay housing.

That’s the threat: the relay is now exerting environmental control in this shaft to force compliance. If it increases the shift, you’ll lose fine grip strength and risk either dropping the vial or having it ripped from you—and the growing fissure in the wax means the “taste” is already becoming a breach.

#### Turn 31 **[GAME]**

You don’t act.

You keep your grip, keep the vial at the wax line, keep the prayer-wheel held at its last quarter-turn.

The relay acts anyway.

The slot tightens again—this time not with a single yank, but with a steady, increasing pull like a winch taking up slack. Your fingers blanch. Glass bites into skin. The fissure in the wax seal creeps another few millimeters with a dry, sugar-crack sound.

The “gravity tilt” in your inner ear becomes physical. Your shoulder drifts a fraction toward the relay housing; your boots squeal as their tread loses honest purchase. The candle flames along the wall flatten toward the viewport, pulled by a airflow that wasn’t there a moment ago. Somewhere below, a fan spools up to a higher pitch.

The voice—still singular, still close—speaks with patient certainty.

“You can’t hold your grief and the lever at the same time.”

The prayer-wheel continues clicking, but you feel it slipping out of sync with your hand, like the relay is beginning to keep its own cadence. The brass ridges under your palm grow warm, almost feverish.

Over the buffer, Sera’s breathing stutters. “Doctor— it’s changing here too. The seam—” She cuts herself off, bites down audibly.

The masked one moves. You hear it drag something metallic—its boot heel or a tool—across the deck in a sharp line, then plant itself. “Everyone stay still,” it orders, voice muffled but firm. “No hoods off. No touching. Eyes down.”

A second later, Tomas coughs—one harsh bark he can’t fully suppress—and the sound carries down the sealed corridor like a signal.

Something answers on the far side of that door: a soft, wet scrape, as if a palm or mask is being drawn slowly across the metal from the other side. Not a thud. Not an impact. A deliberate *listening* touch.

Back in the alcove, your vial shifts a centimeter deeper despite your grip. The slot’s edge dimples around the wax like lips finding purchase. The seal is still mostly intact, but the crack is now wide enough that a thin ribbon of scent—burnt copper and old paper—spills out, and the tendon-filaments behind the viewport visibly flex toward it.

Immediate, concrete threat: if the pull increases even slightly, you will either lose the vial into the relay (and whatever is sealed will be taken), or the wax will fracture fully in your hand, releasing its contents to the node on the relay’s terms. Simultaneously, the sealed corridor is no longer quiet—something on the medics’ side is now actively responding to them through the door.

#### Turn 32 **[PLAYER]**

I bare my teeth and bite my own tongue hard enough to flood my mouth with copper, forcing my hands to steady. “Fine—one drop,” I snarl, and I twist the prayer-wheel back into sync, then crack the wax just a hair more with my thumb to let the relay *sip*—not take—while I keep the vial braced against the slot.

Into the buffer, urgent and low: “Sera—masked one—eyes down, stay braced. If you hear your name, bite and think of numbers. Do not answer.”

I slam my palm against the lever housing and whisper into the viewport, shaking, “Now. You get a taste, I get the lever—open the throat the right way and hold the seam quiet, or I yank it out and you starve.”

*Agent reasoning: The relay is forcing the vial; if I keep resisting I’ll lose it and maybe doom Sera/Tomas. I’ll trade a controlled “taste” for leverage, keep cadence with pain/anchoring, and use the partial breach to demand the lever/opening now—then cut the flow by resealing/withdrawing.*

#### Turn 33 **[GAME]**

Your teeth punch through your tongue. Copper floods your mouth—hot, real—and the tremor in your wrists steadies as your body chooses pain over panic.

You twist the prayer-wheel back into sync. The relay *notices*. The click becomes obedient again, matching your quarter-turns instead of dragging ahead. The “tilt” eases half a degree; your boots regain a thin, honest grip.

You crack the wax a hair more.

The slot doesn’t yank. It *sips*.

A single bead—dark, viscous, not quite liquid—draws itself out of the fissure and vanishes into the irised seam with a sound like a candle going out. The scent of burnt copper flares, then collapses into nothing. Behind the viewport, the tendon-filaments shiver in satisfaction, retracting just enough to expose the lever’s internal latch-rod.

Your slammed palm on the lever housing lands on brass that is suddenly body-warm. It pulses once against your skin, like a slow blink.

Outcome: the lever unlocks.

Not fully—yet. The bar that had clacked down lifts a finger’s width. You can now pull the lever, but it will take effort, and the relay will try to “complete” the exchange if you hesitate.

The voice in the viewport changes. Less offended. More intimate. It speaks as if it’s leaning its mouth to the glass.

“One drop is a door,” it says. “Pull. I will hold the seam—briefly.”

Over the buffer, your warning hits at exactly the right moment.

Sera whispers, “It said—” then clamps down hard; you hear her muffled grunt as she bites her own tongue. The masked one answers immediately, voice flat and controlled: “Numbers. Now. Count.” There’s a pause, then Sera forces, “Sev—eight—nine—ten,” each number like a rung.

Tomas makes a thin, keening noise—almost his own name, almost a prayer—then chokes it off with a wet swallow.

On the far side of the sealed door, the wet scrape stops.

Replaced by three soft knocks, perfectly spaced. Not random. A *cadence*—an attempt to teach the door to answer.

Immediate threats, clear:
- Your wax seal is now compromised; if you let the vial slip even a little farther in, the slot will take more than “one drop.”
- The lever is usable now, but pulling it may open the “throat” in a way that also gives whatever is at the sealed corridor a better path to *speak back* through metal and vibration—those three knocks are it testing the line.

#### Turn 34 **[PLAYER]**

I wedge two fingers hard against the slot’s lip to stop it drawing the vial any deeper, then yank the vial back a fraction—just enough to break its “lips”—and immediately haul the lever down in one committed pull. Into the buffer, voice thick with blood: “Now—brace and count higher, no gaps; if the knocks match your count, stop and bite.” I lean into the viewport, furious and pleading at once: “Hold the seam like you swore—no names, no answering—just silence.”

*Agent reasoning: I can’t let the relay take the vial, and I can’t leave Sera and Tomas with that cadence learning their names; I’ll pull the lever fast while “holding the seam” is promised, and physically jam the slot so it can’t swallow more.*

I press close to the viewport, shaking with rage and need: “Hold the seam like you swore—no names, no answering—just silence.”

*Agent reasoning: The relay is already trying to take more than agreed; I need to break its seal on the vial and force the lever before it can renegotiate.

I jam two fingers against the slot’s lip and wrench the vial back just enough to break its “kiss,” then I haul the lever down in one brutal, committed pull. “Brace—count higher, no gaps; if the knocks match your count, stop and bite,” I rasp into the buffer through blood. Pressing close to the viewport, I whisper, shaking, “Hold the seam like you swore—no names, no answering—just silence.”

*Agent reasoning: The relay has tasted enough; if I hesitate it will take more. Pulling the lever is our only chance to redirect the “throat” and damp the door’s answering cadence, but I need the others anchored in numbers so they don’t respond to names.*

#### Turn 41 **[GAME]**

Your two fingers find purchase on the slot’s rim—cold metal slick with wax-sweat—and you wrench the vial back. For a heartbeat it resists like a mouth refusing to let go, then the “kiss” breaks with a wet pop that isn’t liquid at all: the incense in the air collapses inward, as if the ship inhaled through that tiny seam.

Blood sheets from your torn cuticle onto the vial’s wax seal. The seal hisses where it touches you—warm, offended—and a hairline crack spiders across it.

You haul the lever down.

The relay answers immediately. Not a click—an impact. The bulkhead behind the lever thumps once, deep and structural, and the viewport fogs from the edges inward with frost. The corridor beyond M‑Alcove 9 shifts: panels that were flush flex like ribs, and the hallway’s nerve-light stutters into a steady, chapel-blue.

In your buffer, the trapped medics obey you. You hear breath forced into rhythm, the scrape of boots bracing.

“Counting,” one of them says, voice tight. “Thirty-one… thirty-two… thirty-three…”

The knocks come back—not from the door, but from inside the wall between you and them, traveling along the conduit you just engaged. Three quick taps, then a pause; then four—clean, patient, as if someone is learning their pace.

“Don’t—” the second medic starts, and clamps down hard. You hear teeth meet flesh. A muffled whimper follows, then swallowed.

You press to the viewport and whisper your vow into the seam.

Something answers anyway—not a name, not spoken aloud. The glass vibrates under your forehead with a subsonic syllable that you *feel* in your molars. The frost on the viewport blossoms outward in a pattern like handwriting—loops and ligatures that almost resolve into letters before they smear.

Down the corridor, a Concord engineer you’d left working the transept line appears at the bend, drawn by the impact. He stops dead when he sees the frost-writing and your bloody hand on the lever.

“Dr. Voss,” he calls, too loud, raising his scanner like it’s a weapon. “Step away from the relay. What did you just interface with?”

Behind him, somewhere deeper in the ship, a door seals with the sound of a closing throat.

#### Turn 42 **[PLAYER]**

I snap two fingers up at the engineer in a sharp *cut it* gesture without looking away from the frost-writing. “Lower your voice and that scanner—now. This conduit is live and it’s learning our rhythms.”  

Into the buffer, steady despite the blood: “Keep counting. No names. If you hear a word that feels like it’s in your teeth, bite down and skip ten.”  

Then, to the viewport, almost tender with fury: “You don’t get to speak through them.” I smear my bloody thumb across the frost-syllable to ruin its shape and angle my body between the relay and the engineer. “You want an answer, take it from me—silently.”

*Agent reasoning: The engineer’s volume and suspicion could provoke the ship or trigger the “answering” pattern; I need him quiet and compliant while I keep the medics counting and assess the cracked vial/seal.*

#### Turn 43 **[GAME]**

Your cut-gesture lands. The engineer flinches like you struck him, then does the opposite of what you want: he tightens his grip on the scanner and takes one step closer, trying to angle the device past your shoulder at the relay.

“Live conduit is exactly why I’m scanning,” he snaps—still too loud. His voice bounces wrong off the corridor, returning a fraction late, as if the ship is practicing it.

In the buffer, the medic keeps counting. “...forty-seven… forty-eight… forty-nine…” The cadence is steadier now, disciplined.

Then the thing you warned them about arrives: a pressure in the line, not sound—*a word-shaped vibration* that makes your teeth ache in sympathy. The counting stutters.

You smear your bloody thumb across the frost-syllable on the viewport. The writing collapses into a smear of ice and red, and for a half-second nothing happens—

—then the conduit reacts like it’s been insulted.

A sharp, clean knock answers from the wall: *ten* taps in a row, perfectly spaced. Not matching the medic’s count—*commanding* it.

Inside the buffer you hear the medic obey your rule without understanding why: a wet bite, a swallowed cry, then a jump in the count. “...fifty-nine… sixty… sixty-one…” Their voice is thick with blood but still moving.

The engineer’s scanner chirps once—high, bright—and the relay’s lever shudders under your palm as if something tugged it from the other side. The scanner display (you glimpse it sideways) flashes a waveform that looks uncomfortably like speech.

“Shit,” the engineer breathes, finally lowering his voice. He doesn’t lower the scanner. “It’s responding to us.”

Behind him, the corridor door at the bend seals with a decisive *clang*, cutting off retreat. A seam of frost races around its frame like a rosary being counted.

The engineer looks back at the sealed door, then at you. His free hand goes to the emergency release on his belt.

“You’re between me and the relay,” he says, quieter now, urgent. “Move, or I move you.”

The threat is immediate and physical: he’s preparing to force you aside, and the ship is actively using rhythm/knocks to shape behavior through the live conduit.

#### Turn 44 **[PLAYER]**

I lift my blood-slick hand, palm out between us, and speak low like a confession. “Don’t make yourself a pattern it can wear—kill the scanner tone, now.”  

Without taking my body off the lever, I slide one boot back and angle my shoulder toward him—ready to take the shove—then murmur into the buffer, “Good. Keep the jump. If the taps give you a number, you give them a different one.”  

I meet the engineer’s eyes finally, flat and exhausted. “If you put hands on me, it will copy your urgency and push it into their skulls. Help me instead—get that belt release ready and watch the seam. When the knocks start matching *you*, you bite and look away.”

*Agent reasoning: If he scans louder/closer, the ship will “learn” him and use him as a metronome; I need to de-escalate without letting him touch the relay, and keep the medics counting to resist the tooth-word.*

#### Turn 45 **[GAME]**

He holds your gaze for two breaths, jaw working. Then—finally—his thumb finds the scanner’s side toggle. The chirp dies mid-cycle, cut off so abruptly it leaves a pressure-ghost in your ears.

The corridor *improves* immediately: the late-echo of his earlier shout stops repeating. The frost around the sealed door slows, beads up, and hangs instead of racing.

“Tone off,” he whispers. “It was pinging the conduit. I didn’t—” He swallows the rest, eyes flicking to your bloody hand on the lever like he’s seeing it as a circuit input, not a person.

In the buffer, the medic answers your instruction. The wall taps: *four… four… four*—insistent. The medic’s voice comes back thick and deliberate: “...seventy-two… seventy-three… eighty-three…” They’re lying with numbers, and the taps falter, losing confidence—spacing goes uneven, like a drummer thrown.

Your warning about patterns lands. The engineer’s shoulders drop a fraction, urgency tamped down by force of will. He unclips the belt release—an emergency mechanical override spindle—without pulling it yet, and crouches slightly to get his eyes level with the relay seam instead of your face.

“Tell me what I’m watching for,” he mouths more than speaks.

You feel the lever under your palm go colder, as if the ship is withdrawing heat in irritation. The viewport’s smeared frost-and-blood tries to re-form into loops; it can’t hold the shape, but it keeps attempting, like a hand writing through a veil.

Then the new threat makes itself plain: the knocks begin to migrate.

They’re no longer coming only through the conduit wall to the trapped medics. A faint, precise tapping starts behind the engineer—inside the sealed door at the bend—matching the rhythm of his breathing as he crouches. In. Out. Tap. Tap.

His eyes widen when he realizes it. He clamps his teeth on his lower lip hard enough to blanch it, and forces his gaze down to the floor plates, away from the seam.

The ship has started to copy *him*. If it completes the match, it can use his body as a metronome—and then it won’t need the scanner tone at all.

#### Turn 46 **[PLAYER]**

I exhale a long, ugly laugh through my teeth—deliberately off-tempo—then whisper, “Watch the frost. When it starts writing clean loops again, it’s *locked*.” I tap two fingers against my own sternum in an irregular pattern for him to follow and murmur, “Breathe to this—steal your rhythm back.”

Into the buffer: “Good—keep lying. If it gives you fours, you give it thirteens. No matching.” 

Then to the engineer, barely audible: “On my count—when the taps match your breath exactly—pull the belt release once, hard, and look away like it’s a lover you regret.”

*Agent reasoning: The ship is entraining to the engineer’s breath; I need to break his rhythm without panicking him, keep the medics counting wrong, and use the belt release at the right moment—when the ship “locks on.”*

#### Turn 47 **[GAME]**

Your laugh comes out wrong on purpose—ragged, clipped, refusing any steady meter. The corridor doesn’t like it. The tapping behind the engineer stutters, tries to re-find him, then doubles too fast and loses the breath it was following.

He watches your two-finger pattern on your sternum like it’s a life sign on a monitor. He starts breathing to it—uneven, stolen back. In… hold… out… short-in… long-out. The taps behind him chase, miss, chase again.

In the buffer, the trapped medic commits to the lie. The wall taps offer *four* again. The medic answers: “...ninety-six… ninety-seven… one-ten… one-eleven…” There’s a wet swallow between numbers. The other medic, quieter, starts repeating the false count under their breath like an anchor.

The frost on the viewport and door seam does what you warned it would: it *tries* to write clean loops again. The smeared red-ice thickens into pale curls. For half a second you see a near-perfect ligature form—too smooth, too confident—then your off-tempo breathing pattern disrupts it and the loop frays at the edge, as if the writer’s hand trembled.

Outcome: you successfully break the engineer’s breath-pattern match before it can fully “lock,” and you prevent the frost-writing from stabilizing into a clean, readable script.

Consequence: the ship shifts tactics.

The tapping stops copying breath and becomes *instructional*—three taps, pause, three taps—like a signal meant to be answered. And it’s no longer only behind the engineer. A second set begins inside the relay housing under your hand, vibrating up through the lever into your wrist.

The engineer’s face goes pale as he feels it too. He bites down hard, eyes dropping away from the seam, and whispers, “It’s in the metal. It’s in—”

The sealed door at the bend gives a sudden, heavy *thunk* from the far side, like someone leaned their full weight into it. Not a knock—an impact. Dust shakes loose from the frame.

Whatever is on the other side of that door is now moving with purpose, and the ship is using the relay to cue it.

The engineer tightens on the belt release spindle, waiting for your count, but his hand is shaking—one hard pull might override the lock, or it might strip the mechanism and leave you with nothing but a broken handle.

#### Turn 48 **[PLAYER]**

I press my forehead to the cold viewport and hiss, “No answering,” then deliberately *miscount* the ship’s three-tap signal under my breath—“one, four, seven”—to poison the rhythm.  

Into the buffer: “Ignore any threes. If you hear threes, you go silent for ten and then restart at a different number.”  

I grab the engineer’s wrist lightly—steadying, not controlling—and whisper, “Now. One hard pull—then hands off, eyes down.”

*Agent reasoning: The ship is trying to force a call-and-response; I need to deny it an answer, keep the medics anchored, and use the belt release before the thing at the door arrives—while reducing the chance the engineer strips the mechanism by guiding a single decisive pull.*

#### Turn 49 **[GAME]**

Your forehead meets the viewport with a dull click. Cold bites your skin; the frost there isn’t random anymore. Under the smear of blood and melted script, negative space sharpens into a map—stars picked out by absence, and one tight cluster circled by a ring of micro-cracks, as if someone worried the same point again and again. It isn’t decorative. It’s a chart. A junction.

You hiss “No answering,” and poison the rhythm—“one, four, seven”—over the ship’s three-tap signal.

Outcome: the three-tap pattern breaks. It does not get a clean call-and-response from anyone in the corridor.

Consequence: the ship reacts by trying to *make* an answer.

The relay housing beneath your hand vibrates harder, and the lever kicks once, a sharp mechanical twitch like a tendon spasm. The engineer’s eyes flick up despite himself—then you catch his wrist.

“Now,” you whisper.

He yanks the belt release once, hard.

Metal screams. A short, brutal grind, then a *clack* like a tooth snapping into place. The sealed door at the bend exhales a seam of dust and frost as its lock bolts retract by a finger’s width—enough to change the sound, not enough to open.

At the same instant, the corridor lights dip and recover, and the incense-thin air gusts toward the door as if something behind it inhaled.

In the buffer, your instruction lands. The medic hears the threes and goes dead silent—no counting at all—for a long, terrifying stretch. You can hear their breathing through teeth. Then, ten seconds later, they restart at a different number, voice shaking but controlled: “...two… three… nine…”

The engineer obeys the rest: hands off, eyes down. He bites his lip again and keeps his gaze on the deck plates, whispering, “Release engaged. Door didn’t—” He doesn’t finish.

Threat, clear: something on the far side of the door is now right up against it. You hear nails—or something like nails—drag once along the inner face, slow and testing, exactly where the bolts just shifted. The ship has failed to get an answered rhythm, so it’s bringing a body to the threshold.

And on the viewport under your brow, that circled star-cluster holds steady, as if the ship is insisting: *this is where the splice lives.*

I peel my forehead off the viewport and keep my gaze on the *blur* of the frost-map, not the loops. “Engineer—back with me, three steps, irregular. Don’t look at the door; don’t listen for it.”  

Into the buffer, calm as I can fake: “You’re doing well. Keep the lies. If you hear dragging, you *stop* counting and breathe through your teeth until it passes.”  

I lift my bloodied thumb and, without staring, trace the circled star-cluster’s position onto my own palm like a note I can’t afford to forget. Then I whisper to the corridor itself, venom-soft, “If you want the splice, you’ll have to take it from my silence,” and I reach for a loose service panel edge—something to pry free—ready to throw it down the hall as a clattering decoy *off-tempo* if the door starts to open.

*Agent reasoning: The ship is baiting us with the star-junction and pushing a body to the door; I need to keep everyone from syncing, keep the medics alive, and use the map clue without feeding it attention. I’ll retreat us from the door, keep eyes down, and quietly record the junction for later while preparing a non-rhythmic disruption if the door gives.*

#### Turn 51 **[GAME]**

You peel away from the viewport. A coin-sized patch of skin on your forehead stays numb, then burns as warmth returns. You keep your eyes on the blur of the frost-map, and it holds—no clean loops, no legible ligature—just that stubborn circled cluster you’ve now burned into yourself.

Outcome: the engineer follows your instruction. He takes three steps back with you—uneven, deliberately wrong-footed. He keeps his eyes down. He does not look at the door.

The door at the bend does not open, but it *answers* your retreat with pressure: the bolts that retracted a finger’s width creep another hairline back with a soft, incremental click. Something on the far side exhales again, and the air in the corridor tugs toward the seam hard enough to flutter the engineer’s coat hem.

From inside the door: one long drag of nails (or something harder than nails) across metal—left to right—ending in a small, wet tap exactly where the latch would catch if it were fully thrown. It’s testing the weakness the release created.

In the buffer, your calm instruction steadies them. The medic who was counting stops immediately at the dragging sound. You hear both of them breathing through their teeth—thin, controlled, painful. No numbers. No rhythm offered back.

You lift your bloodied thumb and trace the circled star-cluster onto your palm. The blood doesn’t smear the way it should; it beads, as if the skin is briefly less yours than the ship’s. The mark you draw stays clear.

As you reach for a loose service panel edge, your fingers find a slightly lifted corner plate—old brass with a seam of frost under it. It’s loose enough to pry.

And that’s when you notice what the viewport was sitting on: beneath the kneeler-rail at the base of the viewport frame, a thin strip of mosaic has been replaced with conductive inlay—an angular sigil, candle-wax geometry. A Candle‑Synod barter-mark. Someone traded a memory *here*.

The panel edge bites under your nail as you lever. It gives with a quiet snap of fasteners—louder than you wanted in the hush.

Immediate consequence: the corridor’s nerve-light shifts toward you, as if attention has turned. The dragging behind the door stops. Silence—then a single, deliberate knock from the far side, not on the door, but low, near the floor. Right where a hand would reach if it could slip under.

You have the loosened panel in your grip, ready to throw. The threat is clear: whatever is behind the door is now probing for any opening at the bottom seam, and the lock has already been partially compromised.

#### Turn 52 **[PLAYER]**

I grip the brass panel and flick it down the corridor *past* the door’s line—two sharp clatters, then a scrape—nothing even, nothing answerable. “Engineer, eyes down—stay with my breath,” I whisper, then press my bloody palm over the Candle‑Synod inlay without looking at it. “Who paid here,” I murmur to the ship, “and what did they buy?”

*Agent reasoning: The thing at the door is probing low; if I feed it a rhythm it can follow, it’ll come through faster. I need to misdirect sound away from the seam without creating a steady pattern, and the Candle‑Synod mark is a clue I can’t ignore—memory-trade means leverage or trap.*

#### Turn 53 **[GAME]**

The brass panel leaves your hand with a flat, ugly spin. It hits the deck *past* the door’s line with two sharp clatters, then skitters into a long scrape that turns into a dull, tumbling rattle as it kisses a ribbed conduit cover.

Outcome: the sound does what you want—it’s irregular, unanswerable, and it pulls attention away from your breathing pattern.

The thing behind the door reacts immediately. The low probing knock at the floor stops. You hear a sudden, fast scuttle on the far side—too many contact points, too quick—then a hard impact against the door higher up, like a shoulder-check or a body thrown sideways. The partially retracted bolts chatter in their channels but hold. Frost puffs from the seam in a quick burst.

The engineer flinches at the impact, but he keeps his eyes down when you tell him. He matches your breath—ragged, off-count, workable. His whisper is almost inaudible: “I’m with you. I’m—” He swallows. “It’s trying to *learn* us.”

You press your bloody palm onto the Candle‑Synod inlay.

The inlay warms under your skin—wrong, like a tongue against a wound. The blood doesn’t just smear; it *thins*, drawn into the angular grooves as if wicked into circuitry.

Outcome: the barter-mark “takes” your contact and answers you.

Not with words—through your buffer’s bone-conduction, a memory-flash that is not yours:

A pilgrim kneeling here, face hidden under candle-drip veils, whispering a lover’s name into the rail. A vial—wax-sealed—pressed into a trembling hand. Then the ship’s corridor doors sealing in sequence, *not randomly*, but like sutures closing a wound: click… click… click… trapping three Concord uniforms on the wrong side of a junction while the procession flowed past untouched.

The answer lands in your mouth like copper:

**Who paid:** the Candle‑Synod—specifically a veiled pilgrim with wax on their knuckles, the same careful hands that seal memory-vials.

**What they bought:** a *routing*. A protected path for the Lament Procession—and a trap that stranded Concord agents and the sick together near Elara’s working corridors.

Consequence: the ship marks you as a participant in that exchange. The nerve-light along the floor brightens in a thin line that starts at the inlay under your palm and runs—like a vein—toward the partially opened door.

At the door seam, something thin and dark begins to worry at the bottom edge from the far side, trying to find purchase. Not under the door—*into* the seam where the bolts have shifted. If it gets a hook in, it can start pulling the gap wider.

#### Turn 54 **[PLAYER]**

I rip my bloody palm off the Candle‑Synod inlay and smear the blood sideways across the mosaic, blinding the clean angles, then grind my heel over the glowing floor-line as if I can bruise the ship’s “vein” out. “You already got paid,” I whisper, venom-thin. “No second purchase.”

Without looking up, I tug the engineer closer by his sleeve and murmur, “Stay off-beat with me—don’t be brave, just be ugly.” Then I crouch and jam my fingers and the edge of my boot into the bottom seam, trying to block the thin hook and feel where it’s biting. “Tell me—do you have anything that sets fast? Foam, resin, sealant—anything we can vomit into this gap?”

*Agent reasoning: The ship just admitted the Synod bought a routing and used it to strand people near me; it’s trying to pull the door wider through the compromised seam. I need to deny it leverage, break the “vein” of attention from the inlay, and keep the engineer from becoming a rhythm again—without escalating into a pattern it can mimic.*

#### Turn 55 **[GAME]**

You rip your palm free. Blood smears across the Candle‑Synod angles—ruining their clean geometry with a sideways, human blot. When you grind your heel over the bright floor-line, the light doesn’t go out, but it *stutters*—a brief dimming like a blink forced shut—then it reroutes in a thinner thread around your boot, seeking the path of least resistance.

Outcome: you don’t “bruise” the ship into stopping. You do disrupt the neatness of the Synod mark; whatever clarity it had is muddied.

Consequence: the ship reacts like a body touched where it doesn’t want to be touched. The nerve-light in the corridor shifts a shade colder. The air pressure tugs again toward the door seam, harder.

You yank the engineer by the sleeve; he comes without protest, eyes fixed on the deck. He tries to keep his breath ugly with yours. “Ugly,” he repeats, like a mantra. His fingers are shaking so badly he has to pin his own wrist.

You crouch and jam your fingers and boot edge into the bottom seam.

Immediate outcome: you intercept the hook.

You feel it—thin, hard, and *barbed*, worrying at the gap from the far side. It catches skin. Not a deep cut, but enough to make your finger go slick. The barbs don’t pull straight; they *saw* sideways, searching for tendon or a ring of bone to anchor on. It’s trying to get leverage on you, not just the door.

From behind the door: a wet, quiet sound like someone smiling with a full mouth.

The engineer hears your question and snaps into function. He pats his belt without looking up, voice tight: “I’ve got—” a swallow, “—a micro-seal cartridge. Two, maybe three bursts. It’s for conduit leaks, sets in thirty seconds if it’s not—” he flinches at the barbed tug “—if it’s not *moving*.”

He fumbles the pouch open by touch and presses a small canister into your free hand: a thumb-length cylinder with a flip nozzle and a pressure tab.

Threat, clear: the hook is now *caught on you*. If you pull your hand back wrong, it will rake and possibly snag deeper. If it gets purchase, it can yank you into the seam or widen it enough for something else to follow. Meanwhile, the bolts in the door chatter again—another tiny retreat—like the lock is losing the argument one click at a time.

#### Turn 56 **[PLAYER]**

I go very still, teeth bared. “Don’t pull,” I murmur—more to myself than him—then flip the micro-seal nozzle with my thumb and press it right into the seam where I feel the barbs biting. “On my breath—when I exhale, you press your boot harder on the gap.”

I hiss out a slow, ugly exhale and fire a burst of sealant into the seam, trying to flood around the hook and glue it to the doorframe instead of my finger. Without looking up, I rasp to the engineer, “If it sets on me, you cut my glove—*not* my hand. Do you have a blade?”

*Agent reasoning: The hook is trying to anchor in my flesh; yanking will only feed it. I need to pin it in place and entomb it with the fast-set sealant, then get us away before the door gives another click.*

#### Turn 57 **[GAME]**

You go still. The barbed thing in the seam twitches once, as if surprised you didn’t flinch, then resumes its slow sideways sawing—testing for a panic-pull.

You flip the nozzle. Plastic clicks in the quiet like a prayer bead snapping.

“On my breath,” you tell him. The engineer’s boot shifts closer by centimeters. He doesn’t look up. His voice is a thin thread: “Ready.”

You exhale—long, ugly—and fire.

Outcome: the sealant *gets in*. The first burst punches into the seam with a wet, pressurized spit and instantly turns chalk-pale as it expands. It floods around your fingers and the hook’s contact point.

For half a second, the hook fights—fast vibration against your skin—then it *sticks*. Not cleanly to the frame, but to the foam as it blossoms. The sideways sawing stops. The tension on your finger eases by a fraction, like a line going slack.

Consequence: the door answers the intrusion. The partially retracted bolts chatter and then slam forward a hair—reflexive, like a throat trying to close around something forced into it. That motion compresses the foam and your knuckles at once. Pain spikes; you feel skin pinch and the barbs bite again, but now they’re biting into hardening sealant too.

The engineer presses his boot harder on the gap on your exhale, exactly as instructed. The added pressure keeps the seam from widening, but it also grinds the foam into a tighter wedge. The air tug toward the seam falters—then stops, as if the leak has been temporarily choked.

From behind the door: a sharp, frustrated scrape—metal on metal—followed by a sound like someone tapping a fingernail rapidly in place, searching for a new purchase. It can’t pull the hook back easily now. It’s pinned.

You rasp about a blade.

The engineer’s hand hesitates at his belt, then he produces a small folding cutter—industrial, blunt-tipped. He keeps it low, offering it handle-first without looking at your face. “Yes. Cutter. Tell me where.”

Threat, clear: the foam is setting fast. If your finger is caught in the expanding wedge when it fully cures, it will lock you in place against the seam; if the thing behind the door shifts tactics and yanks, you’ll be the anchor point. Also, the bolt mechanism just “tested” forward—if it cycles again while you’re still in the seam, it could crush your fingers between door and frame.

#### Turn 58 **[PLAYER]**

I take the cutter without looking up. “My glove—index and middle. Cut the fabric at the seam, shallow. If you feel skin, stop.”  

On my next exhale I ease my fingers back millimeter by millimeter, letting the glove sacrifice itself to the setting foam, and I whisper toward the door, “Stay hungry. Stay stuck.”

*Agent reasoning: The foam is about to lock my fingers in place and the bolts could cycle again; I need to free my hand without giving the hook a clean pull, and keep the engineer steady and off-beat.*

#### Turn 59 **[GAME]**

You take the folding cutter and press it into the engineer’s hand where he can find it by touch.

“My glove—index and middle,” you tell him.

He nods once—small, mechanical—then crouches beside you. He braces his forearm against the deck to steady the shaking and slides the blunt tip into the seam *against the fabric*, not against you. The first cut is hesitant. The second is cleaner. You feel the glove fibers part, a dry tearing sensation, and then a faint tug as the foam grips the outer layer.

Outcome: he cuts the glove free without nicking skin.

“If you feel skin, stop,” you said—he stops twice, repositions, then finishes the split. “I didn’t hit you,” he whispers, like he’s reporting a vital sign.

On your next exhale, you ease back millimeter by millimeter.

The foam has already started to crust. It resists, then releases in tiny pops as the glove material peels away from it. The barbed hook twitches once—too late—embedded in the hardening sealant. Your fingers slide out, leaving two torn strips of glove and a smear of blood behind, fused into the pale foam like a specimen.

Outcome: your hand is out. The hook is pinned. The seam is temporarily sealed.

Consequence: the door mechanism reacts to the loss of your “plug.” The bolts cycle—one short, violent clack—testing, then settling. The seam tightens a fraction; the foam wedge compresses and holds. No more air tug. For now, it can’t widen the gap.

From behind the door comes a new sound: a slow drag downward, as if whatever is there is lowering its weight along the door to feel for weakness. Then—very close to the seam—three soft knocks in an uneven rhythm that matches your “ugly” breathing for a beat, like it’s practicing.

Threat, clear: the foam will hold for minutes, not hours. If the thing behind the door can work the bolt mechanism again—or find a new point of purchase higher up—it can start a different breach. And your exposed fingers are slick with blood; if you have to brace the seam again, you’ll have less grip and more pain.

The engineer swallows and finally looks at your hand. “You’re bleeding,” he says, then immediately adds, “Not bad. Not—arterial.” He shifts his boot, keeping pressure on the bottom edge, eyes flicking to the chattering bolts as if expecting them to jump again.

#### Turn 60 **[PLAYER]**

I wrap my torn glove tight around my fingers like a crude bandage and murmur, “Good. Thank you.” Then, to the engineer, low and sharp: “Don’t answer the knocks. Don’t match them—if you catch yourself syncing, bite your tongue and break it.”

I edge away from the seam, still eyes-down, and point at the viewport rail without looking straight at it. “You—take your boot off the gap, slow, and back up to me on *your* irregular count. We’re leaving the foam to die alone.”  

Into the corridor, venom-soft: “Practice all you want. I won’t sing back.” Then I ask the engineer, “Where’s the nearest junction with a manual wheel-lock—something *dumb* and physical?”

*Agent reasoning: The foam buys minutes, not safety; I need distance from the door and to stop feeding it patterns. I also can’t let the engineer spiral—keep him anchored with simple tasks while I decide where to run and what the Synod mark means.*

#### Turn 61 **[GAME]**

You wind the torn glove around your index and middle fingers. It’s not sterile, but it compresses; the bleeding slows to an ooze. Your knuckles throb in time with the ship’s distant pulse.

“Good. Thank you.” The engineer’s shoulders drop a fraction, like he’s been waiting for permission to keep breathing.

At your warning about syncing, he jerks his gaze to the door. The uneven knocks come again—three, then a pause, then two—close enough to feel through the deck. His lips part as if to count along, then he clamps his jaw shut hard. You hear a wet click: he’s bitten his tongue on purpose. He nods once, eyes watering, and doesn’t speak.

You edge away from the seam, eyes down. When you point to the viewport rail, he understands without you looking at him.

He lifts his boot off the gap slowly.

Outcome: the foam holds. The seam does not immediately reopen.

Consequence: as his weight comes off, the door gives a tiny *inward* flex—less than a centimeter—but enough to make the hardened sealant creak. From behind it, something scrapes upward, testing. The knocks stop. Replaced by a steady pressure, like a shoulder leaned into the door to feel where it might fail next.

The engineer backs toward you on an irregular count—he makes it deliberately messy, tapping his teeth together between steps to break any rhythm. He keeps one hand on the viewport rail as an anchor.

Your “I won’t sing back” lands in the corridor. The ship doesn’t answer with words. It answers by shifting the nerve-light: a brief ripple runs along the floor-lines ahead, as if the corridor is “listening” for where you’ll go.

You ask about a manual wheel-lock.

He swallows blood and points down-corridor without stepping into the rippling light. “Old service junction,” he whispers hoarsely. “Two turns left from here—past the blistered saint relief. There’s a dumb wheel on a pressure hatch. Mechanical dogs. No auto-bolts. But—” he glances back at the sealed door “—it’s closer to M‑Alcove 9. The Synod runs lines through there.”

Threat, clear: behind you, the sealed door is now under sustained force. The foam will eventually shear or pop if that pressure keeps building, and if it fails you’ll have very little warning—no more knocks, just a sudden gap and whatever can fit through it.

#### Turn 62 **[PLAYER]**

I tighten the glove-wrap with my teeth, then murmur to the engineer, “Good—keep biting if you have to. Pain is honest.”  

Keeping my eyes on the deck seam-lines, I steer us *around* the rippling nerve-light in a crooked path. “Service junction. Now. Irregular steps—no counting aloud,” I whisper, and as we move I add, thinner, “If you hear a hymn you recognize, don’t translate it. Let it be noise.”  

As we pass the blistered saint relief, I risk a glance back over my shoulder—just a flick—listening for the foam to crack. “When we reach that wheel, you turn it. I’ll watch the corridor.”

*Agent reasoning: The foam won’t hold; we need a dumb mechanical barrier fast, but the Synod’s lines near M‑Alcove 9 are a psychological hazard. I’ll keep the engineer grounded, avoid the rippling floor-lines, and move with irregular rhythm toward the wheel-lock while listening for the foam giving way.*

#### Turn 63 **[GAME]**

You tighten the glove-wrap with your teeth. The fabric tastes like old sealant and copper. Your fingers go numb at the edges—compression working.

The engineer nods at “Pain is honest,” jaw set. He keeps a slow, ugly chew going—tongue between molars—like he’s afraid his mouth will accidentally learn a rhythm.

You steer both of you around the rippling nerve-light in a crooked path, watching the deck seam-lines instead of the wall-lit “guides.” Outcome: the ripple doesn’t follow. It continues forward along the straighter route you *didn’t* take, fading as if disappointed.

You pass the blistered saint relief: brass blistered into a melted face, eyes replaced with a mesh of re-soldered wire. Someone has recently pressed candle-wax into the wire like offerings; it’s still soft.

You risk the glance back.

The foamed seam is still intact—but it’s whitening under stress, spiderwebbed with hairline cracks. The door has bowed inward a fraction. No knocks now. Just a constant, patient pressure and a faint rasping that could be breath or metal. Then, as you turn away, a single sharp *tick*—like a bolt tooth skipping.

The engineer flinches hard enough to stumble, catches himself on the rail, and bites down until you hear a small whine in his throat. He doesn’t speak.

Ahead: the service junction hatch comes into view—round wheel, grease-scarred, with stamped warnings in three alphabets. It’s “dumb,” physical, and it looks like it hasn’t been opened in a while: frost pearls on the wheel spokes, and a strip of wax-seal across the seam bearing the Candle-Synod’s candle-mark.

As you close the last few meters, a soft chirp comes from a ceiling maintenance node—an innocent telemetry ping. Immediately after, the corridor nerve-light behind you shifts color, and you catch the smallest reflection in the saint relief: a pale face turning away at the far intersection, robes the color of clinic linen.

Someone just confirmed your direction and left.

The engineer reaches the wheel, hands trembling. “I—turn it,” he whispers, and sets his grip.

Threats, clear:
- The foamed door behind you is cracking under sustained force; it may fail soon.
- The wheel hatch is wax-sealed by the Synod; breaking it may draw them—or trigger one of their “protections.”
- A Choirwarden-adjunct is nearby and now knows where you’re going.

#### Turn 64 **[PLAYER]**

I press my bandaged fingers to the wax-seal and smear it hard, ruining the candle-mark with blood and heat, then flick the worst of it off the seam. “Turn—now. Don’t hesitate.”

Without looking down the corridor directly, I angle my body to watch it in the saint’s warped reflection and whisper, “Sera Kline—if that’s you, keep walking. I’m not confessing tonight.”

*Agent reasoning: The foamed door is close to failing and we’ve been spotted; the only safety is through the dumb hatch, but the Synod wax-seal could be a trap—so I’ll break it quickly and have the engineer open while I watch for both the thing and the warden, refusing any “hymn” engagement.*

#### Turn 65 **[GAME]**

Your bandaged fingers press into the wax-seal. It yields with a soft, obscene warmth—wax taking the print of your torn glove and the ridges of your knuckles. Blood streaks through the candle-mark, turning the Synod’s neat emblem into a smeared bruise. When you flick the worst of it away, the seal is ruined; the hatch seam is no longer “blessed closed.”

Outcome: the wax-seal is broken.

Consequence: the ship notices. Not with an alarm—with a subtle change in the corridor’s breath. The incense here thins for a second, like lungs pausing, and the nerve-light along the deck dims around the hatch as if the floor is withdrawing its attention from you.

“Turn—now. Don’t hesitate.”

The engineer obeys. He grips the wheel with both hands and hauls. The first quarter-turn fights him—frost cracking off the spokes, grease stiff as tallow—then the dogs inside clunk over, one by one: *thunk… thunk… thunk*. On the third clunk, the hatch gives a reluctant sigh and the seam opens a finger’s width.

Outcome: the wheel-lock is disengaging; the hatch is starting to open.

Consequence: something on the other side exhales cold, dry air into the corridor. It smells like old metal and stored dust—no incense. Your wrapped fingers sting as the temperature drops.

You angle yourself to watch the corridor in the saint’s warped reflection and whisper toward the robed figure you saw: “Sera Kline—if that’s you, keep walking. I’m not confessing tonight.”

In the saint’s distorted brass, the pale face stops. Not fully turning toward you—just enough that you see the line of cheek and the glint of an eye. A quiet, precise voice answers from down the hall, pitched to carry without echoing into a hymn.

“Doctor Voss,” Sera says. “You just broke a Synod ward. That’s not confession. That’s escalation.”

She doesn’t approach. Instead, she lifts one hand, palm outward—two fingers together, a Warden signal for *hold*. Behind her, the nerve-light along the deck briefly ripples in a tight ring, as if marking your position for someone else.

Threat, clear:
- The robed Warden has effectively “tagged” your location; others may arrive.
- Behind you, the foamed door gives a sudden brittle *crack*—one of the spiderweb lines you saw has split. The pressure on the other side hasn’t stopped.
- The hatch is opening into a cold, unincensed space; whatever is down there isn’t buffered by the filters, and sound carries differently.

#### Turn 66 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my eyes on Sera only in the saint’s reflection and say, very even, “Then call it triage—there’s something behind that door that doesn’t respect your wards.”  

To the engineer, I hiss, “Open it—wide. Now,” and as the hatch gives, I slip my shoulder in and pull myself through, leaving the corridor air behind. Over my shoulder to Sera: “Don’t follow unless you want it to learn your name.”

*Agent reasoning: The foam is failing and Sera is tagging us; the only safe move is through the dumb hatch, but I want to slow Sera without giving her a hymn or a confession to latch onto.*

#### Turn 67 **[GAME]**

“Then call it triage—there’s something behind that door that doesn’t respect your wards.”

In the saint’s reflection Sera’s mouth tightens. She doesn’t argue. She shifts her stance—half a step back, weight on the rear foot—ready to move fast if the corridor turns on her.

You hiss, “Open it—wide. Now.”

The engineer yanks the wheel through the last resistant arc. The locking dogs retract with a final *thunk* and the hatch swings inward with a heavy, reluctant glide. A gust of unincensed cold pours out, strong enough to flutter the loose edge of your glove-wrap. The air on the other side is dry and stale; it tastes like oxidized brass and dust that hasn’t been breathed in years.

Outcome: you get the hatch open and you force yourself through.

You slip your shoulder in and pull yourself into the service junction. Your boots hit a narrow metal grate walkway. It rings once—clean, loud—then the sound seems to get swallowed by the space’s geometry. The junction is a cylindrical maintenance throat with ladder rungs, bundled cabling, and frost-webbed valves. No nerve-light here; only a few emergency lumen strips, dim and intermittent.

Behind you, the engineer follows your movement with a panicked half-step but stops short of entering—caught between your command and the corridor threat. His hands stay on the wheel.

Over your shoulder you warn Sera: “Don’t follow unless you want it to learn your name.”

Sera answers immediately, voice still controlled but sharper. “It already knows mine. It uses it in Clinic.”

She does not follow you in. Instead she raises her wrist and speaks into a concealed comm-bead—two clipped syllables, then: “Junction throat. Seal corridor side if you can. Do **not** sing.”

Consequence, immediate: from the corridor side, the foamed door gives way. Not a full blowout—one long split opens in the whitening foam with a wet, tearing sound. A thin line of darker air jets through, whistling. The door bows another centimeter.

Threat, clear:
- The door behind you is actively failing; whatever is pressing it is about to create a gap large enough for fingers, tools, or something else to probe through.
- The engineer is still on the corridor side with the hatch open; if the door breaches, he’s exposed and the breach could also vent into your unincensed junction.
- Sera has called for backup and a corridor seal attempt; you may be cut off on either side depending on who gets there first.

#### Turn 68 **[PLAYER]**

I grab the engineer’s sleeve hard and yank. “In. Now—don’t think,” I snap, hauling him through the wheel-lock and using my shoulder to help swing the hatch inward.  

As soon as he clears, I shove the hatch shut and put my weight on it. “Turn it back—fast, all the way,” I hiss at him, then add under my breath, “No rhythm. No prayer.”  

I glance up the throat at the frost-webbed valves and cable bundles. “Is there a manual cutoff—air, sound, anything—something we can crank to make this place *deaf*?”

*Agent reasoning: The engineer’s hesitation will get him killed if the door fully breaches; the unincensed junction is safer than the corridor, and I’d rather risk Sera sealing us in than let “it” reach him. I’ll pull him through and slam the hatch, then look for a secondary manual lock/valve to deaden sound and airflow.*

#### Turn 70 **[PLAYER]**

I seize the engineer’s sleeve and yank hard. “In. Now—don’t think,” I snap, dragging him through the wheel-lock as I throw my shoulder into the hatch to swing it inward.  

The moment he clears, I slam it shut and lean my weight into the metal. “Turn it back—fast, all the way,” I hiss. “No rhythm. No prayer.”  

I flick my gaze up the throat at the frost-webbed valves and cable bundles. “Is there a manual cutoff—air, sound, anything—something we can crank to make this place deaf?”

*Agent reasoning: I can’t leave the engineer out there with the door splitting; getting him inside and sealing the hatch is immediate survival. Once we’re shut in, I’ll look for any manual dampers or cutoffs to deaden sound and isolate us from the corridor’s “listening.”*

#### Turn 71 **[GAME]**

Your grip bites through the engineer’s sleeve. He makes a small, involuntary sound—more startled than pained—and then your yank decides it for him. He stumbles over the threshold into the unincensed throat, boots skidding on the grate.

Outcome: you get the engineer inside.

The hatch tries to swing back out—corridor pressure and panic fighting you—but you throw your shoulder into it and slam it shut. The impact shudders up your arm. For half a second you feel heat through the metal, like a palm pressed from the other side.

Consequence: something on the corridor side *touches* the hatch—once—then withdraws.

“Turn it back—fast, all the way. No rhythm. No prayer.”

The engineer nods too hard and grabs the wheel. His hands tremble; he starts to crank in jerky bursts, then catches your meaning and forces it into ugly, arrhythmic motion—stutter-turns, pauses, a doubled jerk. The dogs bite home with uneven clacks.

Outcome: the wheel-lock re-engages; the hatch is sealed.

Consequence: the corridor-side whistling you heard a moment ago drops to a muffled hiss. Not gone—just damped, like a mouth pressed to cloth. A faint thud follows, as if something hit the hatch with a forearm and slid off.

You look up the throat: frost-webbed valves, cable bundles strapped like tendons, a maintenance placard half-iced over. The lumen strips flicker, then steady.

“Is there a manual cutoff—air, sound, anything—something we can crank to make this place deaf?”

The engineer swallows. His breath fogs in a tight cloud. “There’s… there’s a baffle manifold. For acoustic isolation during weld work.” He points up and left: a handwheel beneath a rectangular box marked in worn stencil: **AUX BAFFLE / THROAT-9**. A second wheel beside it is tagged **VENT BYPASS**.

He adds, voice low, “But if we close the baffle, we also choke airflow through here. It’ll get… thin. And the bypass—” he hesitates, eyes darting to the hatch “—the bypass vents to the transept plenum. If that plenum’s being sabotaged—”

Threat, clear:
- Closing **AUX BAFFLE** may reduce what can “hear” you, but it risks suffocation and makes sound behave oddly (your own voices will carry inside your skull).
- Opening **VENT BYPASS** could pull corridor contamination—or whatever’s behind that foamed door—toward you if the plenum is compromised.
- The hatch is holding, but something is testing it from the other side in intermittent, probing impacts.

#### Turn 72 **[PLAYER]**

I grip the engineer’s wrist to still his shaking and guide his hand to the **AUX BAFFLE** wheel. “Half-turn at a time—stop between. Make it ugly,” I murmur, then lean in close, forehead nearly to his temple. “We borrow air later. Right now we borrow silence.”

As he turns, I keep my palm on the hatch, eyes shut, listening through the metal for the pattern of those probing thuds. “Bypass stays closed. If you feel yourself starting to count, bite your tongue.”

When the baffle’s partway shut, I whisper, “How long until this throat gets thin enough to make you stupid?”

*Agent reasoning: I’m more afraid of being “heard” than of thin air for a short stretch; we can manage breath, but not a learned name. I’ll close the baffle partially, keep the bypass shut, and force the engineer to stay irregular and quiet while I listen for changes at the hatch.*

#### Turn 74 **[PLAYER]**

I catch his wrist and steady it, guiding his hand onto the **AUX BAFFLE** wheel. “Half-turn at a time—stop between. Make it ugly,” I murmur, leaning close, forehead nearly brushing his temple. “We borrow air later. Right now we borrow silence.”

I keep my palm flat to the hatch, eyes shut, listening for any rhythm in the impacts. “Bypass stays closed. If you feel yourself starting to count, bite your tongue.”

When the baffle’s partway shut, I whisper, “How long until this throat gets thin enough to make you stupid?”

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is being tested and the corridor-side presence seems to learn through pattern; sealing sound feels safer than venting. I need the engineer calm and compliant, and I need a realistic time window before hypoxia compromises us.*

#### Turn 76 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my hand wrapped around his wrist and force his grip back onto the AUX BAFFLE wheel. “Half-turn. Stop. Breathe. Half-turn. Stop,” I murmur, deliberately breaking any cadence by changing the spacing and pressure of the words.  

My other palm stays on the hatch, eyes shut, listening for the next thud through the metal. “Bypass stays closed. If you catch yourself counting, bite your tongue—hard.”  

I open my eyes just enough to find his face. “Talk to me in plain numbers: how long before the air goes thin enough to make you stupid?”

*Agent reasoning: The corridor-side thing is probing for rhythm and names; I need silence more than comfort, but I also can’t let the engineer panic or hypoxia take us. I’ll keep the baffle closing in irregular increments, monitor the hatch for changes, and get a concrete time estimate while keeping him grounded.*

#### Turn 77 **[GAME]**

Your hand clamps his wrist; the tremor doesn’t stop, but it stops *owning* the motion. He gets his fingers back on the AUX BAFFLE wheel and obeys—half-turn, stop, a breath that catches, then another half-turn with a different angle of force. The wheel fights like it hasn’t been moved in months; something gritty inside the manifold complains in a dry, granular rasp.

Outcome: the baffle begins to close in uneven increments.

The sound in the throat changes first. Your own breathing grows louder, not in the air but in your skull—bone-conducted, intimate. The lumen strip nearest the baffle box flickers and steadies again, as if the system is rerouting.

Your palm on the hatch feels the next probe: not a thud this time, but a *press*—slow, exploratory, sliding a few centimeters as if something is reading the seam. Then a single, blunt knock. Then stillness.

Consequence: whatever is outside has shifted from testing strength to mapping the edges.

The engineer’s eyes keep darting to your hand on the hatch like he expects it to be bitten off. You catch his face in the lumen’s pallor: lips already drying, a faint sheen of sweat at the hairline despite the cold.

“Plain numbers,” he whispers back, voice thin. “This throat’s not meant for occupancy. If we take it to… halfway closed baffle and keep the bypass shut—” he swallows and glances up at the frost-laced valves as if they might answer for him, “—you’ve got maybe **twelve minutes** before you get *stupid-stupid*. Headache, bad decisions. **Six** before it starts—buzzing fingers, slow words.”

He forces another ugly half-turn. The wheel clacks, then slips a fraction back like the manifold is spring-loading against him. He clamps down, knuckles whitening.

Danger, now immediate: the hatch shivers once—harder—like something outside has leaned its weight into it. A soft, wet squeal follows, metal on something not-metal, dragging along the lower edge. The wheel-lock holds, but the vibration travels through your palm up into your teeth.

The engineer’s gaze snaps to you. “If it finds the latch-side—” he starts, then bites his tongue mid-sentence as if catching himself falling into a pattern.

He just nods toward the hatch, eyes wide: *it’s learning where to push.*

#### Turn 78 **[PLAYER]**

I pull my hand off the hatch like it’s hot and shove the engineer’s shoulder to angle him away from the latch-side. “Two more ugly half-turns—then stop. Don’t fight the spring, just hold it,” I say, then slap my palm hard against the hatch in three uneven strikes—loud, arrhythmic—right over the seam it was tracing.  

I lean close, voice ragged. “Where’s the nearest secondary crawl out of this throat—service grate, ceiling drop, anything that doesn’t open back to *that* corridor?”

*Agent reasoning: It’s mapping the latch; we need to confuse it and buy seconds without falling into rhythm. I’ll keep the baffle closing just enough, shift our position away from the latch-side, and use vibration/noise to mask the seam while planning an exit before hypoxia hits.*

#### Turn 79 **[GAME]**

You yank your palm off the hatch and shove the engineer’s shoulder; he stumbles a half-step, boots scraping frost, and ends up angled away from the latch-side like you wanted. He doesn’t argue—just clamps both hands on the AUX BAFFLE wheel and forces two more ugly half-turns with stops between.

Outcome: the baffle closes further and holds, but the manifold’s spring-load is now fighting to reopen it; he’s bracing to keep it from creeping back.

Your three uneven slaps land hard on the seam. The metal answers with a sharp, hollow ring—then, immediately, a response from the other side: a *single* knock, perfectly placed where your last strike hit, as if mimicking you. After that: a slow, scraping drag along the seam again, lower edge, latch-side hunting.

Consequence: it didn’t retreat; it corrected. It’s still working the latch-side despite your misdirection.

The engineer’s eyes go glossy with panic for a heartbeat, then he forces himself to speak without falling into rhythm. “Secondary—yeah—there’s a—” He jerks his chin upward. “Ceiling drop. Two meters back, above the conduit bundle. Old incense return. It’s *unincensed*—maintenance. Tight. Grate’s held with four quarter-turn dogs.”

He shifts one hand off the wheel for a second to point, then immediately returns it, jaw clenched as the wheel tries to ease back. “You’ll need the cutter. Or—” he shakes his head once, like refusing to finish a thought in sequence, “—hands if you’re strong and not shaking.”

Danger becomes explicit: the hatch shivers again—hard—right at the latch-side. A faint, metallic *tick* follows, not from your side but through the door’s body, like something outside has found a point to pry and is testing it in tiny increments.

The engineer whispers, “That’s… that’s the latch tongue.” He swallows. “It’s trying to walk it.”

#### Turn 80 **[PLAYER]**

“Hold that wheel. Don’t be brave—be stubborn,” I tell him, then pull my sleeve over my hand and wedge the fabric into the wheel spokes as a crude jam.  

I back toward the conduit bundle, eyes flicking between the ceiling drop and the hatch. “Point again—exactly which dogs,” I hiss, reaching up to the grate with both hands and trying to twist the first quarter-turn fast, no rhythm—just raw, ugly force.  

Without looking back, I add, “If it pops, scream my name—don’t pray.”

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is being pried at the latch; staying here risks it opening and the air is thinning. We need the ceiling crawl as an exit, but I can't leave the engineer alone with the baffle springing open—so I’ll make him hold it while I open the grate fast, even if I cut my hands.*

#### Turn 81 **[GAME]**

He nods once—jerky, stubborn—then leans his weight into the AUX BAFFLE wheel like it’s a live thing trying to buck him. When you pull your sleeve over your hand and wedge fabric into the spokes, it *does* add friction—enough that the wheel’s spring-back slows to a reluctant creep instead of an immediate snap.

Outcome: the baffle stays mostly closed, but it’s not a lock; it’ll still try to unwind if he slips.

You back under the conduit bundle. The ceiling grate is there, half-hidden behind braided lines crusted with frost. Four quarter-turn dogs—flat brass tabs with slot-heads—sit at the corners. They’re old and slightly proud of the frame, as if the grate has been removed and reseated too many times.

The engineer points without letting go of the wheel—just a chin-jab and a staccato whisper. “Top-left first—then… no. Any. Just don’t—” He stops himself before a cadence forms, bites down hard, and you hear his teeth click.

You get both hands on the first dog and twist.

It moves—barely—then squeals, metal-on-metal, before giving a grudging quarter-turn. The dog snaps into its “open” position with a *clack* you feel through your wrists.

Outcome: one dog is open; three remain closed. Your hands sting from cold and torque.

The hatch behind you shudders again, heavier. Not a random slam: a repeated shove low on the latch-side, building force like something is bracing itself. Then the faint *tick-tick* returns—smaller, quicker—like a tool ratcheting.

Threat, clear: something on the other side is actively working the latch tongue, trying to walk it free.

The engineer’s voice cracks. “Elara—” he starts, then clamps his jaw shut like he’s trying not to pray by accident. He re-centers and says it louder, raw and ugly: “**Voss!** It’s— it’s *moving*—”

A sharp, distinct sound follows: the latch mechanism inside the hatch gives a tiny, unwilling *click*—not open, but no longer fully seated.

Consequence: the hatch is closer to popping than it was a moment ago, and the next shove may not be absorbed by the wheel-lock alone.

#### Turn 82 **[PLAYER]**

“Good—keep saying my *name*, not numbers,” I snap, breath scraping. “If it pops, let the wheel go and climb. We live, or we don’t—no hymns.”

I wrench the second dog with both hands, then the third—no order, no cadence—kicking the frame with my heel to jar the brass free as I twist. “Come on—come on—” I hiss, fingers numb, and throw my shoulder up into the grate to test if it’ll drop the moment the last dog turns.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is about to give; I need the grate open now and to keep the engineer from freezing into prayer or rhythm. I’ll prioritize speed—force the remaining dogs, then get us into the crawl and pull the grate back in place as a barrier.*

#### Turn 83 **[GAME]**

He latches onto your name like a handhold. “Voss—Voss—Voss,” he says, loud and ugly, each one a separate shove of breath. He keeps his weight on the wheel.

You wrench the second dog. It fights harder than the first—frozen threads, a burr of corrosion—until your heel-kick jars the frame. The dog jumps loose with a sharp squeal and snaps open.

Outcome: **second dog open.**

You go for the third without pattern, just need. It turns an eighth, stops dead. You kick again—harder. The grate frame shifts a millimeter in its seat and the dog suddenly gives, spinning the rest of the quarter-turn too fast. It slams into its open stop with a loud clack.

Outcome: **third dog open. One dog still locked.**

You shoulder the grate to test it.

It doesn’t drop. It *tilts*—just a finger’s width—because the last dog is still biting. That tiny tilt is enough to make the conduit bundle above you creak and shed a sprinkle of frost down your collar.

Behind you, the hatch answers with a decisive, mechanical change: a deeper *chunk* from inside the latch housing, like the tongue has been levered partway out of its keep. The wheel-lock shudders.

Threat made clear: **the hatch latch is being actively pried open from the corridor side**; it is no longer just “pushing,” it’s working the mechanism.

The engineer reacts exactly as you told him—no prayers, no hymns—just your name, and action. “Voss!” he yells, and then the hatch takes a full-body hit.

The wheel-lock holds for half a heartbeat, then the wheel jerks under his hands as the manifold spring-load surges. He loses purchase; the sleeve-jam tears free and flutters down like a shed skin.

Outcome: **the AUX BAFFLE wheel spins back a fraction**, whining, and a thin gust of colder, thinner air knifes through the throat—enough to make your head ring and your fingertips tingle.

The hatch doesn’t fully blow, but the seam opens a hairline at the latch-side—visible now, a dark thread. Something wet and pale presses into that thread for an instant, testing the gap, then withdraws with a sound like suction.

The engineer abandons the wheel and stumbles toward you, grabbing at the conduit bundle to haul himself up. “Voss—Voss—” he gasps, eyes on the ceiling grate. “Last dog—where—” he can’t finish without rhythm, so he just points with a shaking hand at the **bottom-right** corner of the grate.

#### Turn 84 **[PLAYER]**

I lunge for the bottom-right dog and twist with both hands, snarling, “Voss—say it, keep it ugly,” then slam my heel into the frame to jar it as I force the quarter-turn. “As soon as it drops, you go first—don’t look back.”

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is starting to gap and whatever’s outside is probing; we need the grate open immediately and get both of us into the crawl. The engineer is panicking but responsive to my name—use that to move him. No time to re-baffle properly.*

#### Turn 85 **[GAME]**

Your hands bite the bottom-right dog. It’s colder than the others—cold enough that the brass feels tacky, like skin to a tongue. You twist anyway.

It won’t go. Not at first. The slot-head edges chew at your grip through your sleeve, and you feel the dog flex against the grate frame instead of turning—metal complaining, threads frozen and slightly cross-seated.

You slam your heel into the frame.

The impact jolts the whole assembly; the dog jumps a fraction, then finally starts to rotate. It goes in ugly increments—stop, grind, stop—until it hits the quarter-turn and *snaps* into the open position with a loud, clean clack.

Outcome: **all four dogs are open. The grate is now free.**

Consequence: the grate doesn’t “drop” neatly. It sags, then falls outward and down in a sudden sheet of weight. You manage to keep it from fully crashing by catching an edge with your forearm, but it still slams the conduit bundle on the way, making the lines sway and throw a shower of frost and grit into your face.

At the same instant, the hatch behind you gives up another notch—an unmistakable internal *click* followed by the seam widening from a hairline to a finger-width at the latch-side. Something presses into the gap again, harder: pale, wet, jointed—more like a hand that learned bones from watching hands.

Threat: **the hatch is opening; whatever is outside can now reach through.**

The engineer scrambles exactly as ordered. “Voss,” he barks—hoarse, ugly—then he doesn’t look back. He plants a boot on the conduit brace, grabs the opened grate frame, and hauls himself up into the ceiling return. His heel kicks the dangling grate as he goes, making it swing and clatter.

He gets his torso into the dark duct and reaches one arm back blindly, fingers spread, searching for you without turning his head. “Voss—hand!” he spits, like the word is a tool.

From the hatch gap comes a new sound: a soft, eager inhalation through the opening, followed by the scrape of something dragging along the seam toward the wheel-lock—seeking the next point to widen.

#### Turn 86 **[PLAYER]**

I spit frost from my teeth and grab his forearm hard. “Pull—now,” I snarl, then kick the dangling grate out of my way as I haul myself up after him. As I climb, I throw a single glance back at the gap and whisper, “Not my name,” like a warning to the thing—or to myself.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is already admitting a reaching limb; if I hesitate to observe, it will learn my shape. I trust the engineer’s outstretched hand and choose flight, but I can’t resist one last sensory note—those “learned bones” matter to my work and my grief.*

#### Turn 87 **[GAME]**

His forearm is slick with condensation and shaking from strain, but your grip locks. He *pulls*—hard—using his whole back against the duct lip. Your kick sends the dangling grate swinging aside; it clips the conduit brace with a metallic ring and then hangs at an angle, leaving you a clean opening.

Outcome: you get your shoulders up and through. Your hips catch for a second on the frame; fabric snags and tears with a dry rip, then you’re in—knees scraping metal, palms sliding on frost-slick ducting.

The service junction drops away beneath you. The air in the return is thinner, colder, and tastes like old insulation and ozone. Your breath comes out as a fine white stream that doesn’t quite dissipate—clinging to the duct’s corners.

You glance back.

The hatch seam below is now wide enough for a forearm. Something pushes through—pale, wet, jointed wrong, with skin that looks too smooth to have ever known air. It doesn’t reach for the wheel-lock. It reaches upward, toward the open grate like it already understands “up.”

When you whisper, “Not my name,” the thing pauses mid-reach.

Then, from the corridor side, a voice answers—not spoken through the gap so much as *shaped* by it, as if the metal is a throat: a thin, intimate approximation of your cadence.

“...E-la-ra...”

Not your full name. Not yet. But close enough that your molars ache.

The engineer hears it too. He jerks forward in the duct, dragging you by sheer panic, and hisses, “Don’t—don’t answer it, Voss—don’t *teach* it!”

Consequence: your retreat is fast but messy. The swinging grate below continues to clatter softly against the brace, a repeating metal cue that marks the opening. Behind you, you hear the first scrape of that jointed limb against the duct lip—testing purchase, starting to climb.

#### Turn 88 **[PLAYER]**

I clamp a hand over my own mouth, then grab the engineer’s ankle and squeeze once—hard—our new signal for *move, no words*. As we crawl, I reach back with my boot and hook the swinging grate, trying to wedge it up into the frame to stop the clatter; if it won’t catch, I yank my torn fabric loose and jam it between grate and brace to deaden the sound.

*Agent reasoning: Answering it could “teach” it my voice and rhythm; we need silence and misdirection, plus stop that grate from marking our position.*

#### Turn 89 **[GAME]**

Your palm seals your mouth; your own breath fogs your fingers and warms them just enough to sting. You catch the engineer’s ankle and squeeze once—hard.

He understands immediately. No reply. He just *moves*—elbows and knees driving, boots scraping in short, efficient shoves. The duct amplifies every contact into a dry rasp, but it’s steadier than speech.

You reach back with your boot, feeling for the swinging grate through the opening below. You hook an edge and try to lever it up into its seat.

Outcome: **it won’t re-seat.** The frame is slightly warped from your heel strikes; the grate catches, then slips free with a sharp *ting* as gravity wins again. The clatter returns—softer now, but regular.

You go to the second plan. You yank at the torn fabric at your hip—already half-ripped from the climb—and peel a long strip free with a quiet, vicious tear. You jam it down between grate and brace.

Outcome: **sound dampened.** The next swing hits cloth instead of metal: a muted *thup* and a hiss of fibers. The clatter becomes an occasional dull bump, no longer a beacon.

Consequence: that fabric doesn’t just deaden noise—it *catches*. The grate’s angle changes, held slightly more open than before, like a mouth propped with a gag.

Below, the jointed limb finds the lip again. You hear it: wet skin on metal, then a small, searching tap—tap—tap along the duct edge, as if it’s reading the shape. When it brushes the jammed cloth, it stops.

A slow pull follows. Not strong—curious. Testing.

Threat made clear: **whatever is climbing has found the cloth and is using it to locate the opening; it may also use it as a grip.**

The engineer crawls faster, boots thudding in a hurry he can’t fully silence. At a junction seam ahead, the duct narrows slightly; he shoulders through and drags a wake of frost behind him.

From behind, through the opening you can’t see anymore, that corridor-voice shapes itself again—closer than it should be, as if the duct is learning to speak.

“...Voss...”

Not shouted. Not coaxing. Just *placed*—like a marker driven into ground.

#### Turn 90 **[PLAYER]**

I bite down on my sleeve and yank the jammed strip free with a sharp, silent pull, then shove the loose cloth forward into the duct to keep it from dangling as a ladder. I squeeze the engineer’s ankle twice—*faster*—and, without speaking, press my forehead to the cold metal and force my breathing into slow, even counts, refusing the duct my voice.

*Agent reasoning: It’s learning my name and using the cloth as a guide; I need to remove its grip and keep us moving without feeding it more sound—also steady the engineer with touch, not words.*

#### Turn 91 **[GAME]**

Your teeth clamp sleeve. You reach back blind and *rip* the jammed strip free in one sharp pull.

Outcome: **the cloth comes loose.** The grate immediately swings once, lightly, and then settles into a quieter sway—no longer held open by the jam.

You shove the strip forward into the duct ahead of you, bunching it into a wad so nothing hangs down.

Outcome: **no dangling “ladder.”** Whatever was testing the fabric loses that easy purchase.

The engineer feels the double squeeze on his ankle and surges forward, faster—still silent, but now frantic enough that his boot heels start striking the duct skin with a dull, repeating thud. He doesn’t look back. He just keeps going, shoulders tight, as if he’s trying to outrun a thought.

You press your forehead to the metal and lock your breathing into slow counts.

Outcome: **it helps—partly.** The duct doesn’t get your voice. It does get your heartbeat. With your cheek against the return, you feel a faint vibration syncing to your pulse, like the ship is “listening” through bone.

Behind you, at the opening, the wet scrape pauses. Then comes a different sound: a careful, patient *click*—not mechanical. Like a joint learning a hinge. The limb tries again, not pulling on cloth now but hooking fingertips (too many joints) over the duct lip.

Threat: **it is climbing anyway, using the metal itself.** It’s slower without the fabric, but it’s not stopped.

Then the corridor-voice returns—closer, cleaner, less distorted. It doesn’t ask for your name this time. It offers one, softly, as if reminding you.

“E-la-ra.”

The engineer finally breaks silence in a whisper that’s more breath than word, barely audible: “Keep… counting.”

Ahead, the duct seam you’re crawling toward has a maintenance grille—smaller than the one you came through—its screws painted with old wax marks. The air beyond it is warmer by a fraction, enough that frost beads instead of feathers.

#### Turn 92 **[PLAYER]**

I tap the engineer’s boot twice, then point ahead to the wax-marked maintenance grille and mime twisting a screw—*quiet, now*. I slide forward, brace my shoulder against the duct, and start picking at the waxed screws with my fingertips, trying to crack them loose without a single spoken sound, counting in my head as “E-la-ra” scrapes at the back of my skull.

*Agent reasoning: Speaking is dangerous; I need to get us out through the maintenance grille while keeping the engineer steady and not feeding the thing my voice. The wax marks suggest the grille is meant to be opened—maybe quickly—so I’ll signal and work on it silently.*

#### Turn 93 **[GAME]**

Your two taps land; the engineer freezes mid-crawl, then nods once without turning. He shifts his weight off his heels, distributing it to elbows and knees—quieter.

You slide up to the wax-marked grille. The screws aren’t just threaded—they’re *capped* in a thin, amber prayer-lacquer that has seeped into the slots. Your fingertips worry at the wax, flaking it away in tiny curls.

Outcome: you **crack the first seal**.

The moment the wax lattice fractures, the duct changes. Not in sound—at first in *pressure*. A faint warmth leaks through the seam like breath from a mouth, and the choir behind the bulkheads swells from “background” to nearly audible. Your own exhale returns to you half a beat late, shaped into the beginning of a syllable you didn’t speak.

A memory—uninvited, sharp—snags on the exposed current: your lover’s laugh, bright and ordinary, loops once… then repeats, flattened into a refrain. The metal under your forehead subtly warms, as if something has turned its attention toward this exact point in the duct.

The engineer’s head snaps around. His eyes are wide and wet in the dim return-light. He mouths, silently: *Stop.*

Behind you, the climbing sound accelerates—wet joints finding rhythm on metal. Not flailing now. Purposeful. It’s coming up the way you came.

You keep working the screw without speaking; your nails dig, and the wax gives with a soft crackle.

Outcome: you **can loosen the screw a fraction**, but the price is immediate: the chorus swells again, and your own voice—your cadence—answers from the seam in a whisper-thin harmony.

“…E-la-ra…”

Threat is now clear and close: **the broken wax has turned this grille into a beacon.** Whatever is in the duct is climbing toward the warmth and the looped laugh; whatever is in the ship is listening through the exposed lattice.

You can still withdraw—if you can re-seal or shut this grille back down before it “opens” any further.

#### Turn 94 **[PLAYER]**

I freeze, meet the engineer’s eyes, and give a single sharp nod—*stop*. I smear the loosened wax back into the screw head with my thumb and press my torn cloth wad hard over the cracked seam like a muffler, then motion him to crawl—now—while I keep my palm clamped to the grille until the chorus dulls.

*Agent reasoning: The waxed grille is amplifying the ship’s attention and my own echo; opening it further risks drawing both the climber and the choir. I need to re-seal fast and move, even if it costs us the exit.*

#### Turn 95 **[GAME]**

You nod once. The engineer exhales soundlessly and obeys—he pulls forward on his forearms, careful now, pushing his weight along the duct ribs without letting his boots drum.

You smear wax back into the screw head with your thumb.

Outcome: **partial reseal.** The wax fills the slot again, but it doesn’t bond the way it was—your body heat has softened it. It’s a plug, not a lock.

You press the wadded cloth over the cracked seam and clamp your palm down until your skin numbs.

Outcome: **the “beacon” dulls.** The warmth leaking through the seam is muffled; the chorus drops from a near-audible swell to a distant pressure in your teeth. The delayed echo of your breath stops trying to form syllables.

But the ship doesn’t forget immediately.

For three slow heartbeats, the metal under your hand *pushes back*—not moving, not swelling, just a subtle, steady pressure as if something on the other side is leaning its ear against your palm. Your thumbprint briefly burns hot, then cools to dead cold.

The engineer crawls on, gaining distance. He looks back once, eyes asking if you’re coming, then forces himself to keep moving.

Behind you, the wet climb reaches the level of the grille you just muffled. You hear it clearly now: a multi-jointed hand testing the duct wall, then the lip of the seam. It pauses at the cloth-covered crack and makes a soft, dissatisfied sound—like a throat clearing without air.

Threat: **it is within a few body-lengths of you in the duct, and it knows there was an opening here.**

It doesn’t retreat. Instead, it starts tapping along the duct’s underside, searching for the next weak point—tap… tap… tap—moving forward in the same direction you and the engineer are going.

Your muffling worked, but it also bought you only one thing: **time.**

#### Turn 96 **[PLAYER]**

I peel my hand off the muffled grille and crawl after the engineer, keeping low and quiet; as I go, I hook my boot against a duct rib and give it one deliberate, dull *thump* behind us—then another a few feet later—trying to draw the tapping thing to the wrong spot while I clamp my sleeve over my mouth and keep counting in my head.

*Agent reasoning: Staying still will let it close the distance; I can’t risk another “listening” seam, so I’ll follow the engineer and try to misdirect the creature with sound/vibration while keeping my own voice sealed.*

#### Turn 97 **[GAME]**

You peel your hand away. The cloth stays stuck for a moment—warm wax clinging—then releases with a soft tacky pull. The seam gives a faint sigh of warmer air, but it doesn’t flare back into song.

You crawl after the engineer, keeping your body tight to the duct floor. Your sleeve over your mouth turns your breath into damp heat against your wrist.

You hook your boot against a rib and give a deliberate dull *thump* behind you.

Outcome: **it works—immediately.** The tapping stops. For a half-second there’s only the engineer’s careful pull ahead and the thin rasp of your own fabric.

Then: a wet, jointed *scuttle* toward the sound. Fast. Confident. Whatever is behind you commits to the last vibration it heard.

You crawl another few feet and thump again.

Outcome: **you pull it off your trail—partly.** The scuttle overshoots the first thump and snaps to the second, scraping along the underside of the duct where you can feel the vibration through your ribs. It’s close enough now that the metal trembles under its weight.

The engineer hears it too. He flinches, then forces himself forward harder—still quiet, but faster. He reaches a cross-seam where the duct narrows and twists left. At the bend, there’s a strip of older insulation hanging like skin.

Behind you, the thing tests the duct ribs where you thumped—fingers probing, nails (or something like nails) dragging in short, irritated strokes. It makes a soft clicking that isn’t echolocation so much as *counting*, as if it’s matching intervals.

Consequence: **your decoy buys you distance but raises the tempo.** It’s learned you can “throw” sound, and it starts tapping back—rapid, patterned—searching for your reply.

Ahead, the engineer pauses at the left twist and finally risks a whisper, so thin it’s almost just breath: “There—junction… drop.”

The duct bend is now your next immediate hazard: it’s tight enough you’ll have to turn one shoulder down and slide, and the insulation curtain will brush your face and hands—no way through without contact. Meanwhile the tapping behind you resumes, closer again, and not fooled this time—moving in steady increments toward your last thump-point, then beyond it.

#### Turn 98 **[PLAYER]**

I grab a fistful of the hanging insulation and pull it across the bend like a curtain, then shove the engineer through first with a hard push to his boot. As I follow, I let the insulation drag over my face and neck to hide our scent/heat, then twist sideways and slide into the junction drop without a sound, one hand clamped over my mouth as I count in my skull.

*Agent reasoning: The tapping is learning my tricks; we need to break line-of-sound now. The insulation will contaminate me with whatever the ship is shedding, but the drop is our only escape—I'll use the hanging insulation as a temporary veil and take the rear to buy the engineer time.*

#### Turn 99 **[GAME]**

You seize the hanging insulation and yank it across the bend.

Outcome: **you make a crude curtain**, but it’s not clean—fibers tear free in your fist. A dry, peppery dust blooms in the narrow air and sticks to your damp sleeve.

You shove the engineer by the boot. He jolts forward, catches himself, and slips through the twist left—quiet, but not silent. His knee clips the duct wall with a muted *tok*. He winces and keeps going.

You follow immediately, letting the insulation drag across your face and neck.

Outcome: **it masks heat for a moment and costs you skin.** The fibers are laced with brittle foil strands; they scrape like wire-brush. Your cheek stings, and a line of cold wetness starts along your jaw. The dust clots in your throat behind your clamped hand.

At the junction drop, you turn sideways and slide.

Outcome: **successful silent drop—almost.** You control your descent, boots finding the edge, and you slip down into the darker throat below with only a soft fabric hiss.

Above you, at the bend, the tapping stops.

A hand—too many joints, moving wrong—pushes into the insulation curtain. It doesn’t tear it away immediately. It *pets* it, slow, as if reading the shape of what just passed. Then it presses harder and the curtain bows inward.

The engineer lands below you in a crouch, eyes wide, one hand up as if to steady you. He doesn’t speak. His lips move in a count that matches yours.

The thing’s head—or what serves as one—tilts at the bend. You hear a wet inhale that isn’t breathing so much as sampling.

Threat, clear and immediate: **it has reached the bend and is deciding whether to follow down the drop.** The insulation bought you seconds, not safety.

Then a new sound: a faint metallic *chime* from somewhere deeper in the service junction throat—like a small tool striking pipe. Not you. Not the engineer.

Someone else is down here.

#### Turn 100 **[PLAYER]**

I grab the engineer’s wrist and squeeze twice—*hold*—then point down the throat and trace a question mark in the air. Keeping my sleeve over my mouth, I pull a small shard of torn foil-fiber from my cheek and flick it up toward the drop opening to make a soft decoy-rustle above, while my eyes strain into the dark for whoever struck that chime.

*Agent reasoning: The chime means a living person—or a lure. I need to keep the engineer quiet, avoid drawing the thing down the drop, and identify who’s below without using my voice.*

#### Turn 101 **[GAME]**

Your fingers close on the engineer’s wrist. Two squeezes.

Outcome: **he freezes.** His shoulders lock, breath held. He follows your point, then your traced question mark, and gives the smallest possible nod—he understood: *who’s down there?*

You keep your sleeve over your mouth and pinch a torn foil-fiber shard from your cheek. It comes away with a tiny sting and a smear of your blood on the silver.

You flick it upward toward the drop opening.

Outcome: **the decoy-rustle happens—and it draws attention, but not the way you want.** The shard skitters against duct metal above with a soft *tssk… tssk*, like dry leaves.

At the bend overhead, the wet inhale stops. A beat later: a sharp, deliberate *tap*—right at the lip of the drop. Not searching now. Marking.

Then weight shifts. The insulation curtain is pushed aside. Something braces itself at the edge, and a thin line of colder air pours down as the upper duct is disturbed.

Down the throat, your eyes adjust enough to catch movement: not a person standing, but someone **crouched behind a service strut**—a silhouette with a Concord hard-helmet profile and a tool in hand. The tool glints once and you recognize the source of the chime: a small wrench or spanner, still vibrating.

The crouched figure sees you. Instead of calling out, they raise two fingers in a quick signal—*quiet*—then point urgently at the wall beside you.

You follow their point: a **wheel-lock hatch** half a meter to your right, its rim wax-marked. The wheel is already loosened a fraction, like someone started opening it and stopped.

Above you: the thing begins to descend. You hear the first contact—jointed fingers on the drop edge—then a slow, careful scrape as it tests how to come down without falling.

Threat: **it is entering the drop now.** You have seconds before it’s in the throat with you.

#### Turn 102 **[PLAYER]**

I tug the engineer hard toward the wheel-lock hatch and press my fingers to my lips at him—*no sound*—then I grip the loosened wheel and turn it as silently as I can, easing the hatch open just enough to slip him through first. As he goes, I flick my eyes to the helmeted silhouette and mouth, “Friend?” before sliding in after the engineer and pulling the hatch toward closed without letting it clang.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is the only immediate cover, and the newcomer seems to know this junction; I’ll trust their silent signal and get the engineer through before the thing drops into the throat.*

#### Turn 103 **[GAME]**

You haul the engineer by the sleeve to the wheel-lock hatch and press *no sound* at him. He swallows hard and moves, keeping his boots close to the deck.

You take the loosened wheel in both hands and turn.

Outcome: **it opens—quietly at first.** The wheel gives with a dense, greased resistance like old joints. You ease the hatch inward a few centimeters; a seam of darker air leaks out, colder than the throat, carrying a faint chemical tang—sealant and old incense.

You angle the opening just enough. The engineer slips through sideways, shoulders hunched, one hand braced on the rim so he doesn’t scrape. He disappears into the dark beyond.

You glance to the helmeted silhouette and mouth, “Friend?”

They answer without voice: a sharp head shake—*no*—then a quick gesture: two fingers to their own visor, then down the corridor—*Concord.* Their free hand points again at the hatch, urgent: *close it.*

Above, the thing’s descent accelerates. You hear its weight come off the lip and onto the drop wall—fingers and feet finding purchase in alternating, insectlike beats. It is **coming down now**, committed.

You slide into the hatch after the engineer and pull it toward closed.

Outcome: **you almost get it shut without a sound—almost.** The hatch edge kisses the frame with a soft *thuk*… and then the wax-marked rim catches on a burr. It makes a tiny, bright *tink* as metal meets metal.

In the throat outside, the descending thing stops mid-wall. Absolute stillness for half a heartbeat.

Then: a single wet click, and a slow, purposeful scrape toward the hatch seam—like it’s orienting to the new sound.

Inside the hatch space, you and the engineer are in a cramped service run—unincensed, darker, with condensation slick on the walls. The engineer’s eyes are huge; he holds his breath, waiting on your hands.

Outside, the helmeted Concord figure doesn’t follow you in. They flatten themselves behind the strut again, tool raised, as if preparing to distract—or to strike—if the thing reaches the deck.

Threat is immediate and specific: **the thing is now tracking along the drop wall toward your hatch seam, and your hatch is not fully seated.**

#### Turn 104 **[PLAYER]**

I grit my teeth and press my bleeding cheek against the hatch edge to muffle it, then work my fingertips along the burr, scraping it down as quietly as I can and easing the wheel that last fraction to seat the seal. I tap the inside of the hatch twice in a tight rhythm—*now*—hoping the Concord figure hears and makes a noise away from the seam, while I pull the engineer close and whisper into his ear, barely air: “Don’t move. Don’t breathe loud.”

*Agent reasoning: The hatch isn’t seated and any more noise will bring it right to us; I need a silent seal and a diversion, even if it costs me skin. The Concord silhouette might help if I signal without sound.*

#### Turn 105 **[GAME]**

You press your cut cheek into the hatch edge. The cold metal bites; your blood slicks the rim and **kills the last little metallic chatter**.

With your fingertips you find the burr—sharp as a tooth—and worry at it. Skin catches. You force yourself to go slow anyway, scraping it down millimeter by millimeter.

Outcome: **you seat the hatch.** The wheel turns that final fraction with a tight, reluctant give, and the hatch settles into its frame. The seam goes from a hairline gap to a firm, even join. The chemical tang fades as the seal takes.

You tap twice from the inside: *now.*

Outside, through the metal, you hear the Concord figure respond—not with speech, but with action. A quick series of deliberate noises moves away from your seam: a spanner rapped against pipe (*chime—chime*), then a boot scuff, then another brighter *clang* farther down the throat.

The thing reacts immediately. On the other side of your hatch, you hear its slow scrape pause—then shift. Its joints make a faint, wet ticking as it reorients toward the new sound. It drags itself along the wall, away from your door, following the clangs.

But it doesn’t leave cleanly.

A moment later, something brushes the outside of your hatch—light, testing. Not a strike. A fingertip, tracing the wax-marked rim as if reading it. The pressure increases just enough to make the hatch creak deep in its hinges.

Then it withdraws.

The engineer is pressed to you in the cramped run, trembling. You whisper into his ear. He nods once, eyes squeezed shut, and forces his breathing into shallow, silent sips.

Outside: the Concord figure makes one last noise—sharp and close to painful, like metal snapped against metal—then you hear them run. Fast. Not away from you—away from the thing.

The threat shifts: **the hatch is sealed for now, but the thing has confirmed this door exists and has followed the Concord decoy deeper into the throat.** If the decoy fails, it may come back to the wax-marked seam with purpose.

No new voices inside your service run—only the engineer’s barely-contained panic and the distant, receding wet ticks as the thing pursues.

#### Turn 106 **[PLAYER]**

I press my forehead to the hatch for one last listen, then pull the engineer gently by the sleeve deeper into the run, guiding his hand to the wall so he can follow without stumbling. “In through the nose,” I breathe, barely sound, “count with me—four, hold, four.” As we move, I wipe my blood along the seam of the corridor behind us in a smeared arc, trying to confuse whatever reads wax and scent, and I scan the dark for a secondary panel, ladder, anything that leads away from the throat.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is sealed but marked; staying here risks it returning. The engineer is panicking, so I need to steady him and move deeper into the service run, while also acknowledging the Concord decoy’s sacrifice and looking for another exit or a way to mask our trace.*

#### Turn 107 **[GAME]**

Forehead to metal: you listen.

Outcome: **the throat outside is quieter, but not safe.** The wet ticking is farther away now, layered under a faint, irregular rattle—like something being dragged. Once, very distant, a Concord voice breaks discipline: a single sharp shout cut off into a choke of static through the ductwork. Then only the ship’s slow, devotional vibration.

You pull the engineer by the sleeve into the service run. He keeps one hand on the wall like a blind man, knuckles white. You breathe the count. He tries—fails on the first hold, then matches you on the second, shallow and controlled.

As you move, you smear your blood in an arc along the seam behind you.

Outcome: **it leaves a strong, coppery trail in the cold air.** The smear isn’t subtle; it’s a deliberate mark. If something reads scent, you’ve given it more to read—unless the point is to make the direction ambiguous. The arc does that: the blood isn’t a line forward, it’s a crescent that could mean “here” as much as “gone.”

Your eyes adjust to the unincensed dark. You find structure by touch and reflected frost-sheen:

- On your left, two meters in: a **secondary service panel** with a brass latch, slightly proud of the wall—recently opened and shut, the screws not fully seated.
- Ahead, the run drops into a narrow vertical: a **ladder well** with rungs slick with condensation. A faint draft rises from it, colder, carrying the dry smell of exposed insulation and old ozone.
- On the right, near the ladder well: a **maintenance grille** wax-marked with the same candle-script as the hatch—three short strokes and a tear-shaped seal.

Behind you, from the hatch you sealed: a new sound answers your blood-smear—**a slow, careful scrape on the other side of the metal**, not at the seam now but higher, as if something has put its weight against the hatch and is listening with its whole body.

Threat: **it has returned to your door and is testing it without striking—yet.** The engineer’s breathing starts to climb again as he hears it, and his boot sole squeaks once on the wet deck.

He clamps down, eyes wide at you, silently begging for what to do next.

#### Turn 108 **[PLAYER]**

I grab the engineer’s chin gently and tilt it toward me. “Eyes on me—four, hold, four,” I whisper, then guide him to the wax-marked maintenance grille and press my ear to it for a heartbeat before slipping my fingers under the edge to ease it open without a rattle. “If it comes through that hatch,” I murmur, “you follow my hand, not your fear,” and I motion him through the grille first.

*Agent reasoning: The scrape means it’s triangulating—staying here risks a sudden breach. The wax-marked grille feels like a “sanctified” route the thing might hesitate to follow, and the draft from the ladder well could carry our scent. I’ll take the waxed path and keep the engineer calm and quiet.*

#### Turn 109 **[GAME]**

You take his chin—careful, firm—and pull his focus back from the hatch. He blinks like he’s surfacing.

“In through the nose,” you whisper. “Four… hold… four.”

Outcome: **he follows you.** Not perfectly, but enough that his shoulders drop a fraction and his breathing stops rasping. His eyes stay on yours as you guide him to the wax-marked grille.

You press your ear to the grille.

On the other side: **a thin, steady airflow** and a faint, layered sound like distant singing heard through a wall of water—no words, just a pressure on the eardrum. Closer than that, a soft, intermittent tick-tick—metal cooling or something moving very slowly along duct ribs. No human voices.

You get your fingers under the grille edge and ease.

Outcome: **it opens without a rattle—almost.** The wax seal stretches like warm skin and gives with a quiet, tacky *peel*. The hinge holds; the grille swings out a handspan. Cold air spills over your knuckles.

You murmur to him, “Follow my hand, not your fear,” and motion him through first.

He nods once, jaw clenched, and starts to climb in—hands first, then shoulders. Halfway through, his belt catches on the lower lip. He freezes, panic flaring; you see him about to jerk.

At the same instant, behind you at the sealed hatch: **a new pressure hits the metal from the outside—harder, decisive.** Not a full slam, but a testing shove that makes the wheel-lock groan deep in its housing.

Then a sound you haven’t heard yet: **a wet inhalation**, drawn right against the hatch like something trying to taste the air through the seal.

The engineer’s belt is still caught. If he yanks, it will scrape loud against the grille edge. If you leave him, he may bolt. If you stay, the thing on the other side of the hatch is now actively investigating—close enough that any noise here will matter.

#### Turn 110 **[PLAYER]**

I slide in tight behind him, clamp a steadying hand on his hip, and whisper, “Still—don’t pull.” With my other hand I press my blood-slick fingers between belt and metal lip, easing the fabric free in slow millimeters to keep it from scraping. As soon as it slips, I guide him forward into the duct, then follow through and draw the grille toward closed, holding it firmly to stop any rattle while I listen for the hatch behind us.

*Agent reasoning: He’s about to panic and make noise; I can’t abandon him, but I also can’t let that thing triangulate us. I’ll quietly free the belt and use my own blood-slick hand to muffle any scrape, then get us both through and re-seat the grille.*

#### Turn 111 **[GAME]**

You slide in tight behind him, pin his hip with a steady hand, and whisper, “Still—don’t pull.”

Outcome: **he obeys.** He goes rigid, breath caught in his throat, and you feel the tremor running through his pelvis and legs—but he doesn’t jerk.

Your other hand—blood-slick, cold-numb—worms between belt webbing and the grille’s lower lip. You work it free in slow millimeters.

Outcome: **it slips without a scrape.** The blood acts like lubricant; the belt slides over your fingers with a soft, damp rasp that stays inside the duct. The engineer exhales once, silently, like he’s been holding his life in his teeth.

You guide him forward into the duct. He crawls, careful now, one knee then the other, palms flat to keep from clanging on the ribs. You follow, shoulders squeezing through, and pull the grille toward closed.

Outcome: **you get it nearly shut and hold it steady—no rattle.** The wax at the hinge edge kisses back into place with a muted tack. Your fingers clamp the frame and you listen.

From the hatch behind you (through the wall and down the short run): the wheel-lock groans again, once—then stops. The wet inhalation returns, closer, longer, as if whatever is outside is drawing scent through microscopic gaps.

Then the sound changes.

A thin, hairline *skitter* travels along the deck seam on the far side of the hatch—fast, searching—and you realize it isn’t the Concord figure anymore making noise out there. It’s something **threaded low**, moving where metal meets metal.

The ship answers with a tiny betrayal: the duct you’re in vibrates with the same frequency as your heartbeat, as if it’s amplifying it.

The engineer’s sleeve brushes the duct wall ahead—barely audible—but immediately, outside, the seam-sound pauses.

A moment later: **a soft ripple under the hatch threshold**, like a living filament flexing against the metal. It doesn’t force the hatch. It doesn’t need to—it's testing for vibration, for voice, for warm skin near the floor.

The engineer looks back at you in the duct’s dim, eyes huge. He doesn’t speak. He mouths, silently: *what is that?*

Whatever is out there is now **at the sealed hatch seam**, listening with something that isn’t ears.

#### Turn 112 **[PLAYER]**

I press two fingers to my own throat—*no voice*—then touch his wrist and squeeze twice, slow, to anchor him. With my lips near his ear I breathe, barely there, “Not ears. It reads tremor… heat,” and I start crawling deeper into the duct at a glacial pace, pausing every few inches to let the metal go still. As we move, I force my heartbeat down—counting in fours—and tilt my head, listening for the psalm-whispers to tell me which way the duct “wants” us to go.

*Agent reasoning: Sound will kill us; the filament is reading vibration and warmth, so we need to stop moving, slow our bodies, and get deeper into the duct away from the deck seam. I also need to keep the engineer from panicking and making noise, and I want to understand what the ship is “hearing” through me.*

#### Turn 113 **[GAME]**

You press two fingers to your throat—no voice—and the engineer nods fast, swallowing sound. Your squeeze on his wrist steadies him; his next breath is smaller, controlled.

You put your mouth near his ear anyway and leak only the thinnest air: “Not ears. It reads tremor… heat.”

Outcome: **the words cost you.** Not because they’re loud—they aren’t—but because the duct skin takes them like a confession. The metal under your cheek gives a faint answering *thrumm*, as if the ship repeats the shape of the sentence.

You start crawling deeper at a glacial pace, pausing to let the ribs go still.

Outcome: **you gain distance without drawing a chase.** The seam-thing at the hatch doesn’t force through. Instead, behind you, the sound changes from probing to *measuring*: intermittent, delicate taps—like a fingernail on glass—spaced in a pattern that matches your pauses too closely to be random.

The engineer follows your hand-signals. He keeps his knees off the loudest ribs. His breath fogs the duct, then thins.

You force your heartbeat down—count in fours—and tilt your head to listen for the psalm-whispers.

They come. Not a chorus at first—**a single line**, close and intimate, as if spoken from inside the duct wall:

*—left, left, left—*

The words aren’t in any human tongue, but your brain translates them as direction anyway. With the phrase comes a physical cue: the air on the left branch tastes faintly of burnt copper and warmed insulation; the right branch is colder, cleaner, almost dead.

At the next junction the duct splits:  
- **Left**: a slight upward grade; warmer draft; faint amber pulse-light leaking through screw holes.  
- **Right**: level; colder; silence so complete it feels padded.

As you hesitate, the engineer’s wrist under your fingers twitches—an involuntary tremor.

Behind you, far back at the grille: **a soft, satisfied click**, like something finding purchase on the duct’s outer skin. Not inside with you—yet—but on the other side of the sheet metal, tracking.

And from somewhere below the left branch, a human sound threads up through the duct: **a muffled cough**, then a voice trying not to be a voice—one of the trapped medics, close enough that you can hear the strain in it.

They’re alive. And they’re near the warmer path.

#### Turn 114 **[PLAYER]**

I squeeze the engineer’s wrist again—two slow pulses—then point left and press my palm flat to the duct, willing it to steady. “Hold your breath on the turns,” I mouth, barely any air, and we crawl into the warmer branch inch by inch, pausing with each amber pulse to let the metal stop singing. As we go, I angle my face toward the cough and whisper just once, thin as thread, “Medic—stay still. We’re coming,” then fall silent and listen for that outer-skin tracking to follow or hesitate.

*Agent reasoning: The whispers insist on left and there are living medics there; Elara will risk the warmer route despite it being more detectable, but she’ll try to manage tremor/heat and keep the engineer anchored.*

#### Turn 115 **[GAME]**

You give the engineer the two slow pulses. He matches you—jaw clenched, eyes wet, but present. You point left and press your palm to the duct wall.

Outcome: **the duct steadies—partly.** Your palm stops the local vibration, but the rest of the run still carries a low devotional hum, like the ship is waiting for you to make a mistake.

You mouth, *Hold your breath on the turns.* He nods once and does it—lungs held, shoulders tight—each time the duct angles.

You crawl into the warmer branch inch by inch, timing your pauses to the amber pulse leaking through screw holes.

Outcome: **your movement becomes almost inaudible.** The amber pulses continue regardless—slow, regular—like a heartbeat you didn’t consent to share.

You angle your face toward the cough and whisper, once: “Medic—stay still. We’re coming.”

Outcome: **the medic hears you—and reacts badly.** There’s a sharp, muffled inhale, then a stifled sob cut off mid-sound. A hand thumps once against whatever wall they’re behind, as if they tried to signal and forgot the rules. The thump travels up the duct as a clean, ringing tremor.

Immediately, on the duct’s outer skin behind you: the tracking sound **stops**—a full, attentive pause.

Then it resumes, faster and more certain: a series of tiny, rapid clicks sliding along the outside of the metal, keeping pace with the direction of that thump. It’s not guessing anymore. It’s following a line you just drew for it.

A second later the warmth in this branch spikes—like someone opened a vent to a room full of bodies—and with it comes a new smell: **hot wax and saline**.

Ahead, the duct ribs narrow slightly around a service collar. Beyond it, through a seam in the plating, you catch a sliver of the space you’re approaching: amber-lit, shrine-adjacent machinery… and the edge of a sealed corridor door with **wax runnels** thick along its frame.

From below that door, a voice—thin, forced stillness—hisses up, barely audible: “Don’t—don’t come through the—”

They cut off as if someone clamped a hand over their mouth.

Outside your duct, the clicking reaches the point directly behind you and changes into something else: **a gentle dragging**, as though a filament is being laid along the metal, testing heat through the sheet.

It’s close now—separated from your back by one layer of duct wall. You can feel the faintest localized cold where it touches, like frost forming in a line.

#### Turn 116 **[PLAYER]**

I freeze, press my cheek to the metal until it hurts, and clamp my hand over the engineer’s mouth and nose just long enough to force a held breath, then release and signal *still* with two fingers. Keeping my body flat, I smear a thin line of my blood along the duct wall where the cold filament is testing, then inch forward through the service collar—slow enough the ribs don’t sing—pulling the engineer after me by the wrist. When my lips reach the seam showing the amber-lit space, I exhale a thread of air and whisper, “Quiet—don’t move. Tell me: what’s on the other side of that waxed door?” then go dead still to feel if the dragging hesitates at the blooded patch or follows our warmth.

*Agent reasoning: It’s tracking heat through the duct skin; if I keep moving it will stay on us. I need to break its read—reduce heat signature and vibration—while getting the engineer past the narrow collar and warning the medic to stay silent.*

#### Turn 118 **[PLAYER]**

I go utterly still, cheek pressed to the duct until it aches, and clamp my hand over the engineer’s mouth a beat—*hold*—then release and flash two fingers: *still*. I smear a thin, deliberate line of my blood along the wall where the cold drag tests, then inch through the service collar with glacial care, tugging him after me by the wrist.  
With my lips at the seam over the amber-lit space, I breathe a thread and whisper, “Quiet—don’t move. What’s on the other side of that waxed door?” then freeze again, listening for whether the dragging hesitates at the blooded patch or follows our warmth.

*Agent reasoning: The filament is close enough to read our heat and tremor; the only chance is to stop all motion, mask the scent/heat signature with my blood as a decoy, and get intelligence from the medic without making them panic again.*

#### Turn 120 **[PLAYER]**

I stay frozen, cheek welded to the duct, and keep my grip on the engineer’s wrist—steady, not pulling. I whisper through the seam again, barely air: “Don’t answer loud—tap once for *danger*, twice for *safe*. What’s behind the waxed door?” Then I stop breathing and wait, feeling for any hesitation where I smeared the blood.

*Agent reasoning: The outer-skin filament is close enough to feel; any sound or movement will give us away. I’ll use my blood as a decoy and get information from the medic without forcing them to move, then decide whether we risk the waxed door or keep crawling.*

#### Turn 121 **[GAME]**

Your whisper makes it through. The space beyond the seam goes quiet in a way that isn’t natural—like someone held their whole body still to listen.

A moment later: a single, careful tap answers from below, against the waxed door or the bulkhead beside it. **One tap. _Danger._**

Then a second sound, not a tap—more like a fingernail dragged a short line through softened wax. A pause. Another tiny drag. Someone is trying to add detail without making noise.

Outside the duct, under your blood-smeared patch, the cold dragging **hesitates**—not stopping, but slowing as if it’s reading texture. The metal under your cheek blooms with pinprick frost that bites through skin. The filament tests the blood line again, tracing it, and you feel the temperature drop in a narrow stripe.

Then it **moves past** the blood and continues forward, following the warmer gradient of your bodies through the collar. It didn’t take the bait for long.

The engineer’s wrist in your hand twitches once—reflex, fear. He doesn’t pull away, but his tendons jump like he’s about to bolt.

From below, the muffled voice returns, even thinner, as if spoken through fabric: “It’s… not a room. It’s a—” A hand clamps down again; you hear the wet, panicked sound of someone swallowing a cry.

And then the waxed door itself makes a soft, deliberate sound: **a settling click**, like a latch choosing a position.

In the amber-lit gap you can see, the wax runnels along the doorframe **shiver** and sag a millimeter, as if warmed from the other side. A fresh bead forms and starts to crawl downward.

The immediate threat is clear now: whatever is laying that cold filament is **right alongside the duct, moving with you**, and the waxed door below is **actively changing state**—either sealing harder or preparing to open—while the people behind it are being forcibly silenced.

#### Turn 122 **[PLAYER]**

I press my forehead to the duct and squeeze the engineer’s wrist hard—*don’t bolt*—then draw two slow circles on his skin: *back, quiet*. Through the seam I scrape my nail once, short, through the metal dust—*danger heard*—and breathe, “Don’t open it. Don’t move.”  

Then I start inching backward the way we came, not faster—just relentless—keeping my body flat and my breaths swallowed, trying to put distance between us and the waxed door before it decides to wake.

*Agent reasoning: The filament is tracking our heat, and the waxed door is about to change—opening would be catastrophic. I need to keep the engineer from panicking, warn the medic without sound, and move away from this seam before the thing aligns with us.*

#### Turn 123 **[GAME]**

Your squeeze lands. The engineer’s wrist goes rigid, then—after a heartbeat—he gives you one tiny answering pressure: he understands. He follows, inch for inch, keeping his boots from scraping.

Your nail-scrape through the seam makes a faint grit-noise. Below, whoever is there answers with nothing—no taps, no drag in the wax. But you *do* hear a controlled exhale, like someone forcing themselves not to sob.

You begin backing out.

For three careful body-lengths, it works: you and the engineer slide backward through the service collar, shoulders flattening, elbows tucked. The amber seam narrows behind you.

Then the cold filament outside the duct **accelerates** to match your retreat. It isn’t random. It’s tracking the moving warmth.

The stripe of frost along the duct wall thickens where your blood was smeared, and the metal there **crackles**—a dry, brittle sound—as if the blood has become a conductive wick for cold. The filament tests that spot again, and this time it *doesn’t* slow.

A new sound joins it: a low, measured **knock** from the duct exterior—once… then a pause… then once again—like someone rapping a code you don’t know. Each knock comes from a slightly different point along the duct, keeping pace with you.

The engineer’s breathing finally betrays him: one involuntary inhale through his teeth.

Immediately, the cold outside surges. A needle-thin line of white creeps across a duct seam ahead of your shoulder—**not frost blooming naturally, but a line being drawn**, searching for a gap.

Behind you, the waxed door gives a second, louder decision-sound: **a click-and-drag**, and the amber light under it thins as if the door has seated tighter. The people on the other side have *not* opened it.

You gain distance from the seam, but the threat comes with you: the cold filament is now **probing the duct seams for an entry point**, and it has started to **knock**—as if coordinating with something that can hear breath through metal.

#### Turn 124 **[PLAYER]**

I clamp my mouth to the engineer’s ear and whisper, “No more air—bite your sleeve if you have to,” then pull him tight against me so his chest movement doesn’t rattle the duct. I drag my bleeding palm hard across the nearest seam *ahead* of the creeping white line—smearing wide, not thin—then press my forearm over it like a tourniquet and hum one broken bar of the ship’s psalm off-key, trying to confuse the knock’s rhythm. If the seam starts to give, I kick once—sharp—at the duct rib behind us and commit: we scramble backward faster, risking noise to reach the last junction and drop into the cooler branch.

*Agent reasoning: The cold is using my blood as a conduit and probing for a seam—retreating slowly won’t save us. I need to break its “read” on our warmth and stop the engineer from breathing loud, even if it costs me pain or time.*

#### Turn 125 **[GAME]**

You seal your mouth to his ear and whisper it. The engineer nods once and shoves his sleeve between his teeth. His next breath becomes a muffled, shaking pull of air through fabric. Better—still not silent, but blunted.

You smear your bleeding palm across the seam ahead of the creeping white line, wide and wet, and clamp your forearm over it. The blood spreads into the hairline join like dye into paper.

The probing frost hits your smear and **stops**—not because it’s fooled, but because it reacts. The seam under your forearm goes *numbingly* cold in a blink, and the blood **crystallizes** with a faint crackle, bonding to the metal like a brittle gasket. For two heartbeats, the needle-white line can’t draw forward.

You hum one broken bar of the ship’s psalm—off-key on purpose. The knocking outside the duct falters, loses its spacing… then answers you: **three knocks**, uneven, like a throat trying to mimic a melody without lungs.

That’s when you feel it: the duct isn’t just being traced. It’s being **listened to**.

Somewhere beyond the metal, a small, precise voice speaks—close enough that the consonants tick through the duct wall: “Volunteer tremor pattern. Breath suppression. Hymn-attempt.”

A soft chime follows, like a med-scanner confirming a reading.

Your kick lands hard on a rib behind you. The whole run of duct answers with a hollow *gong*. Dust shakes loose. The engineer flinches, but you’re already committing—scrambling backward faster, elbows and knees scraping.

The cold filament doesn’t try your blood-gasket again. It **goes around**—a line of frost races along a parallel seam, then another, leapfrogging to find an easier ingress.

You reach the last junction and drop into the cooler branch—shoulders first, then hips—both of you sliding into colder, thinner air.

The moment you’re in, a maintenance grille further down the cool branch **ticks**—not opening, but unlatching and relatching once, as if tested from the other side.

And behind you, back toward the warm run, the duct seam you smeared lets out a sharp, tiny sound: **a brittle snap**. Your blood-gasket has started to fracture.

#### Turn 126 **[PLAYER]**

I press two fingers to the engineer’s throat—*no sound*—and guide his head down into the colder airflow, then crawl toward the ticking grille with my bloody palm held up like an offering. “Warden-Medic Sable Rhyne,” I murmur into the metal, and tap a slow, clean pattern: **three—pause—one**, then hum the *ending* of the psalm I just broke, softer, steadier. “If you can hear tremor, hear this too: I’m not your volunteer. Don’t open that grille unless you want it to follow.”

*Agent reasoning: The grille is being tested—someone is close. If it’s Sable, he’s tracking us medically; I need to stop the engineer from panicking and buy a second by making myself the signal, not our breath. I’ll try to communicate through the hymn—something only a confessor would dare—while moving us away from the fracturing seam.*

#### Turn 127 **[GAME]**

Your two fingers on his throat do the job. The engineer swallows once, hard, and holds. You angle his face into the colder run; the thin air steals the urge to pant, turning breath into a sting he can’t afford to make loud.

You crawl toward the ticking grille. Your bloody palm, lifted, leaves a faint smear on the duct ceiling when you brush it—dark against the frost. The cool branch carries sound differently: your tap—**three, pause, one**—travels down the metal like a clean pulse.

For a second there’s only the duct’s own cold.

Then the voice returns, not close now—**directly behind the grille**, as if the speaker has put their mouth to it.

“Don’t use my full name,” Sable Rhyne says quietly. No anger, just a rule. You hear fabric shift, a knee repositioning. “And don’t hum at it.”

A small device chirps twice. Something is being actively monitored.

The grille ticks again—this time not a test, but a **manual latch being thumbed and held**. It does not open. A strip of light appears through the slats: pale, clinical, not the amber nave-glow.

“I can hear tremor,” Sable says. “I can hear the other thing too. It’s riding your duct like a wire.”

He exhales once—controlled, practiced. “If I open this, it may choose *me* instead of you. If I don’t, it may learn the seam pattern and come through anyway.”

You feel the cold filament react to your steadier hum: it stops knocking. Instead, a **slow, sliding pressure** begins along the duct wall behind you, as if something is laying its whole length against the metal to feel for vibration. The temperature drops in a broad band, not a line.

Sable lowers his voice further. “You’re bleeding. That makes you loud to it.”

A pause. Then: “Tell me what you have in your hand. The wax vial. Is it intact?”

As he speaks, the grille’s latch makes a soft **half-turn**—not opening, but preparing. He’s poised to make a decision fast.

The threat is immediate and specific: the “cold filament” has shifted from probing seams to **pressing and listening**, and if it finds a weak point near you or the grille, it will try to enter—either into the duct with you, or through the grille into Sable’s side.

#### Turn 128 **[PLAYER]**

I still my breath and answer in a near-silent rasp, “Call me Voss, then. Yes—the wax vial’s intact.” I press the vial against the duct wall where the cold pressure is sliding, then smear a thick ring of wax around the nearest seam by touch, trying to dull vibration and seal a weak point. 

Without looking back, I tap the grille twice—*don’t open*—and whisper, “If you crack that latch, it’ll take your warmth; talk me through a vent purge or give me a chemical chill—anything to make us colder than it wants.”

*Agent reasoning: Sable needs fast, clear data; if the thing is listening for vibration, I should minimize sound and use the wax as bait or sealant—without opening the grille and handing him over.*

#### Turn 129 **[GAME]**

“Voss,” Sable answers at once, taking the correction. The light behind the grille shifts as if he leans closer; you hear his glove brush the slats. “Good. Keep it sealed.”

You press the wax vial to the duct wall where the cold pressure is sliding. The wax doesn’t melt—there isn’t enough heat—but it **softens just slightly** under your palm’s warmth and the friction. When you smear it into a thick ring around the nearest seam, it does what you intended: the duct’s faint vibration **dulls**, becoming more of a dead thud than a singing plate.

The thing outside reacts immediately.

The broad cold band pauses, then **tightens**—not into a line, but into multiple thin strands you can feel through the metal: like fingers spreading to find edges. The temperature at your wax ring drops hard, trying to make the wax brittle.

A sharp, ugly sound follows: **a high metallic squeal** as something scrapes along the duct exterior right over your seal, testing it for give.

Sable hears it too. The grille latch stops moving.

“Okay,” he whispers. You hear him do something with a canister—cap twist, then a short shake. “You want colder than it wants? I can give you *dry* cold, not vent-cold. Vent purge will make you loud.”

A thin nozzle slips between the grille slats just enough that you can see it: matte steel, medical labeling scuffed off. He does **not** open the grille. He angles the nozzle down the duct toward you and the engineer.

“Two-second burst only,” he says. “Cover your eyes. Don’t inhale.”

He triggers it.

A white fog jets through the slats—chemical chill, bitter and desiccating. It hits your forearm, your cheek, the engineer’s sleeve. The duct interior instantly grows rimed; your wax ring **hardens**, going glassy.

The outside pressure **recoils**—you feel it lift away from the duct wall like a hand yanked off ice. The scraping stops.

But the fog has a cost: the engineer’s restrained breath catches. He jerks once, a stifled cough forced into cloth—still muffled, but it’s a *pulse* of sound.

From behind you, back up the cool branch, the knocking returns—one slow knock—then another—now closer than before, as if the filament has shifted position to flank you rather than force the waxed seam.

Sable’s voice goes tight. “It backed off the seal. It’s moving. Voss—how many meters to your junction?”

#### Turn 130 **[PLAYER]**

“Five—maybe six meters,” I whisper, voice shaved down to nothing. I clamp my hand over the engineer’s mouth and nose just enough to stop the cough from becoming sound, then tug him after me and start crawling—fast, scraping be damned—toward the junction.

Into the grille, between breaths: “Rhyne—one more two-second burst, *behind us* if you can angle it. Then shut it and don’t move.”

*Agent reasoning: Sable needs actionable distance fast; the thing is flanking from behind, so we have to move now while the chill bought a moment. I’ll answer, then prioritize the engineer’s silence and push for the junction/cooler branch, asking Sable for one more burst at the rear if possible.*

#### Turn 131 **[GAME]**

“Five—six,” Sable repeats, committing it like a dosage.

You clamp the engineer’s face. He fights you for half a second—panic, reflex—then yields, eyes wide and wet. The cough dies in your palm as a trembling, silent spasm. His next breath is a thin leak through your fingers.

You haul him forward and crawl hard. The duct punishes speed: elbows skid on frost, knees bang ribs, and each impact sends a dull *thunk* down the run.

Behind you, the knocking answers that new noise immediately—no longer slow. **Three quick knocks**, then a sliding scrape like something dragging itself along the outside to keep pace.

At the grille, Sable doesn’t argue.

“Understood,” he whispers. You hear him shift position, metal clicking as he braces. The nozzle reappears between slats, but angling “behind you” is awkward; he can’t see the duct interior, only aim by sound.

“Two seconds,” he says—then he fires.

The jet catches the duct wall behind you and blooms forward, a harsh, dry fog that **chases your crawl**. It hits the cold filament’s approach point—there’s an immediate, violent reaction: a shriek of metal-on-metal as whatever was scraping **jerks away**.

But the fog also rolls over the engineer’s face and your hand. His inhale seizes. He tries to gasp—your palm stops the sound, but his body bucks, and his boot heel kicks a duct rib with a loud, accidental *clang*.

Sable goes dead silent. The nozzle withdraws. You hear the grille latch click fully shut. No more light.

The thing outside does not keep following the seam where the chill hit. Instead, it changes tactic: **a hard impact** lands on the duct two ribs ahead of you—like it moved around and struck from the side—followed by a rapid frost bloom that crawls toward the junction from *in front*, trying to cut you off.

You round the last stretch toward the junction and see it clearly now: the metal ahead is whitening fast, and a hairline seam at the junction collar is already crusting over, stiffening like a closing throat.

Threat is immediate: if the junction seam freezes shut, you and the engineer will be trapped in the cool branch with the filament on both sides.

#### Turn 132 **[PLAYER]**

I yank the engineer close and shove the wax vial into his hand, fingers crushing around his. “Crack it—smear the collar, now. Keep it *thick*.”  

Then I slam my shoulder and boot into the whitening junction ring in short, ugly bursts—trying to jar it before it locks—humming the psalm’s ending through clenched teeth to break whatever cadence is driving the freeze. “Move, move—through the moment it gives.”

*Agent reasoning: The junction is about to freeze shut; brute force is my only honest tool in a duct, and the psalm has already shown it can interfere with its rhythm. I’ll risk noise to get the collar open while I still can, and use wax/blood as a wedge and vibration-dampener.*

#### Turn 133 **[GAME]**

The engineer fumbles the vial with numb fingers. The wax seal doesn’t “crack” cleanly—he has to worry it with his thumbnail until it flakes, then he smears the softened wax in frantic, uneven swaths around the junction collar. It goes on thick in places, thin in others; where it’s thick, the frost stalls and turns granular instead of glass-smooth.

You hit the whitening ring with shoulder and boot in short bursts. The first impact only numbs you. The second jars something deeper—metal answers metal with a hollow *gong* that vibrates up your teeth.

The third burst is when it goes wrong.

The ship’s delayed echo catches your rhythm. Your own impacts come back a fraction late, as if a second set of blows is landing *after* yours. Your inner ear loses the argument with the vibration. For two breaths the duct flips—up becomes sideways—your stomach lurches and your hands forget where “forward” is.

A phrase comes out of your mouth without permission, loud in the confined duct, shaped like a prayer but not in any liturgy you know. It rings off the plating.

The whispers answer immediately—soft, delighted—and the frost ahead of you stops creeping and instead **pulses**, as if listening for the next syllable.

The engineer freezes, eyes locked on you. His mouth forms a silent question. His hand smears wax again by reflex, but he’s shaking now.

Then you feel it: the cold filament that had been flanking you doesn’t strike. It **settles**—a broad pressure against the duct skin behind your calves, patient, like a body laying down to hear you better.

Your last shove does buy you something concrete: the junction ring gives a harsh, partial shift—just enough that the collar seam opens a finger-width before the frost tries to weld it again. The gap is there, *right now*, but narrowing.

Immediate threats:
- Your vertigo has stolen your orientation; if you keep moving fast, you risk blacking out in the duct.
- The involuntary phrase has “hooked” attention; the filament behind you is no longer searching—it’s listening, close.
- The junction gap is briefly passable but closing under frost pressure.

#### Turn 134 **[PLAYER]**

I clamp my teeth into my own sleeve to strangle any stray syllable, then lock eyes with the engineer and jerk my chin at the gap—*now*—shoving him forward first with both hands on his shoulders. As he wriggles through, I smear the last of the wax thick across the narrowing edge with my bloody palm, then slide after him sideways, one arm hooked through his belt to keep my spinning head from drifting back toward the listening cold.

*Agent reasoning: The gap is closing and the thing is listening for more sound; I need to get us through without feeding it another phrase, even if I’m dizzy. Hand signals and physical guidance over speech, and I’ll sacrifice my own position if needed to keep the engineer moving.*

#### Turn 135 **[GAME]**

Your teeth sink into fabric and skin; the sleeve tastes of old antiseptic and fresh iron. It works—no syllables escape, only a thin, animal breath through your nose.

The engineer understands the chin-jerk. He lunges for the gap, shoulders first. The collar bites his jacket and tries to hold him, frost grabbing cloth like teeth. He wriggles, hips twisting, boots kicking for leverage—one heel catches and scrapes loud.

You slap your bloody palm into the narrowing seam and smear wax hard, packing it into the gap’s edge like caulk. The thick wax doesn’t stop the freeze, but it *spoils* it—keeps it from sealing cleanly. The collar stutters, hesitates, and that hesitation is enough.

The engineer pops through into the next section with a breathless, muffled sob, half-relief, half-pain. He reaches back immediately, grabs your forearm, and yanks.

You slide sideways after him, belt-hooked, head spinning. For a second you’re certain you’re sliding “up” into nothing—then your elbow finds metal and you’re through.

Behind your boots, the junction collar clamps down with a hard, final **clack**. Your wax smear is caught in the seam; it doesn’t reopen, it just leaves a ragged, waxy gasket that prevents a perfect seal.

On the far side, the air is different: warmer by a few degrees and *stale*, carrying a faint burnt-copper tang beneath the maintenance dust. Your eyes adjust to a dim, amber service strip—this is the **warm branch service collar** you’d marked earlier, but closer now, tighter than memory.

The engineer presses his back to the duct wall, clutching the emptied vial like a relic. His lips are blue at the edges from the chill burst. He tries to speak, fails, then rasps: “What—what did you *say*?”

You don’t answer—can’t.

A new sound replaces the knocking: from the sealed junction behind you comes a slow, deliberate **scratching**, not searching now, but writing—tiny, repeated strokes in the metal as if etching a pattern. With each stroke, the duct skin trembles against your spine.

Threat, clear and present: whatever is on the other side can’t follow through the collar *yet*, but it is actively working the seam—either weakening it or preparing something to come through. The warm branch ahead is open, but narrow; if you hesitate here, you’ll be pinned between the collar and whatever’s waiting deeper in the warm run.

#### Turn 136 **[PLAYER]**

I grab the engineer’s collar and pull him close, forehead almost to his. “You didn’t hear anything,” I whisper, flat and urgent. “If you try to remember it, you’ll give it a doorway.”

I point down the warm run and start crawling, forcing my breathing into a counted pattern, one hand dragging along the service strip to stay oriented. “Stay on my boots. No talking—nod or squeeze my ankle if you need me.”

*Agent reasoning: The scratching feels like it’s “learning” us; staying here invites it to breach. I’m dizzy and close to vocalizing again, so I need motion and grounding, and I need the engineer calm enough to stay quiet. I’ll redirect him forward and give a minimal truth without feeding the psalm.*

#### Turn 137 **[GAME]**

He flinches when you haul him in, then stills—your forehead nearly touching his makes him stop trying to look past you toward the sealed collar. His eyes flick left-right like he’s checking for permission to panic.

“You didn’t hear anything.”

His throat works. He nods once, too fast. Then, as if the nod wasn’t enough, he clamps his lips between his teeth until they blanch. He lifts two fingers in a shaky oath gesture—then drops his hand as the duct trembles again.

From behind, the scratching at the junction seam accelerates for a few seconds—short, furious strokes—then abruptly stops. In the silence that follows, you can hear a faint *tick… tick… tick* like contracting metal cooling too quickly.

You turn and crawl into the warm run. The counted breathing helps; the spinning doesn’t vanish, but it becomes a manageable sway instead of a flip. Your hand drags along the amber service strip—warm to the touch, faintly tacky, as if it’s been handled too often.

The engineer falls in behind you, close enough that you feel his breath hit your boots. He does as told: no words. When he needs you, he squeezes your ankle once—hard—then releases, a single clear signal that he’s still with you.

Two duct-lengths in, the warm run narrows at a ribbed collar. The amber strip here is interrupted by a junction box bolted to the wall—its cover plate is slightly ajar, and a thin thread of incense-smoke is seeping *into* the duct from inside it, against the expected airflow.

As you pass it, the box clicks—one relay firing without being touched. The amber strip brightens a fraction, then dims back down.

Behind you, at the sealed junction, something answers that click with a heavy, distant **thud**—not at the seam, but deeper in the structure, as if the thing that was scratching has shifted its weight to another route.

Threat is now explicit: the sealed collar may be buying time, but whatever is listening is no longer committed to forcing that seam. It’s moving through the ship’s body to intersect the warm run ahead, and the junction box bleeding incense suggests you’re approaching a serviced space—one with openings big enough for more than sound.

#### Turn 138 **[PLAYER]**

I stop just past the junction box and hook two fingers around the engineer’s boot to keep him close, then press my ear and cheek to the metal beside the ajar plate, listening for breath or movement on the other side. With my free hand I ease the cover open a hair—no jerks—trying to see where the incense is coming from, then glance back at him and tap my own ankle twice: *hold, stay silent*.

*Agent reasoning: The incense and relay click feel like the ship’s “liturgical circuitry” waking up—possibly a trap or a passage. I need to keep us silent, but I can’t ignore a serviced junction that might open into a larger space or give the thing a shortcut; I’ll investigate the box carefully while anchoring the engineer and preparing to retreat.*

I keep two fingers hooked around his boot and tap my own ankle twice: *hold*. Then I press my cheek to the metal by the ajar plate, listening, and ease the junction-box cover open the smallest amount possible to trace the incense—eyes searching for a vent, a wire-run, or anything moving on the other side.

*Agent reasoning: The incense leak and unsolicited relay click feel like a serviced cavity—possibly an access into a safer space, or a trap. I need intel without noise, and I can’t let the engineer speak or drift away.*

#### Turn 142 **[PLAYER]**

I keep two fingers hooked around his boot and tap my own ankle twice—*hold*. Then I press my cheek to the metal beside the ajar plate, listening for any wet breath or relay-chatter, and ease the junction-box cover open a hair with my fingernails, peering in to trace the incense to its source—vent, wire-run, or something moving.

*Agent reasoning: The silence feels like the ship holding its breath; I need information without feeding it sound, and the incense leak could be a safer route—or a trap—so I’ll inspect with minimal disturbance and keep the engineer anchored and quiet.*

#### Turn 143 **[GAME]**

Your double tap lands; the engineer freezes so hard the duct seems to gain a new brace. His boot muscles tense under your fingers, but he doesn’t pull away. He does not speak.

You put cheek and ear to the metal beside the ajar plate.

At first: only the warm-run’s low hum and your own blood. Then—relay-chatter, but not the crisp *click* you’d expect. It’s a soft, rapid **tktktk** like contacts fluttering under a load, followed by a single deeper **clonk** somewhere behind the panel, as if a latch is trying to seat and failing.

No wet breath. Something else: a faint, thin *whine* that rises and falls in a slow cycle, like a pressure differential being “played” rather than regulated.

You hook a fingernail under the cover and ease it open a hair.

Incense immediately thickens at the crack and threads across your knuckles *toward you*—wrong-way flow confirmed. Inside, your narrow view catches:

- A tight bundle of braided signal lines, their insulation frosted in beads despite the warm duct.
- A palm-sized service vent stub that should be capped; instead it’s fitted with a waxy diaphragm—a thin membrane that pulses inward-outward in time with the ship’s slow heartbeat.
- A relay block with one indicator LED that is not blinking but *breathing*—brightening as the diaphragm pulls, dimming as it relaxes.

As you watch, the diaphragm bulges outward once, too far, like something presses from the other side. The relay flutter you heard becomes audible—**tktktktk**—and the LED flares hard enough to throw a brief afterimage on your retina.

The engineer’s boot jerks in your grip despite himself. He clamps down, but you feel the tremor travel through the sole.

Then, from deeper in the ship—ahead, not behind—comes a heavy, structural **THUD** that repeats once, closer: **THUD… THUD.** Not scratching. Footfall-weight through ribs of metal.

The junction box answers on its own: the relay snaps fully this time, **CLACK**, and the wax membrane in the vent stub puckers open into a pinhole.

A whisper slips through that pinhole—dry, intimate, *right at your ear*—not a word you can translate, but a cadence you recognize from the pylon headphones: the “second voice,” the one that makes teeth ache.

Threat is now immediate and specific: that vent stub is an opening into a serviced space, and something on the other side is using pressure and relays to “listen” and to widen the membrane. The approaching thuds indicate it’s moving to intercept from ahead while the box tries to become a mouth.

#### Turn 144 **[PLAYER]**

I slam my palm flat over the junction-box crack to smother the pinhole and shove the cover shut with my forearm, grinding it into place until the relay chatter dulls. Then I yank my sleeve into my mouth again, catch the engineer’s ankle in a hard squeeze—*move*—and start crawling fast down the warm run, keeping my head low and my thoughts quieter than my breath.

*Agent reasoning: That pinhole is a listening mouth; if it gets language, it gets purchase. I need to deny it sound and sight, and keep us moving before the intercept reaches this run.*

#### Turn 145 **[GAME]**

Your palm smothers the crack. The pinhole’s whisper cuts off mid-cadence like a throat pinched shut.

You drive your forearm into the cover and grind—metal on metal, a protest squeal swallowed by the duct’s insulation. The relay inside flutters once in a panicked burst (**tktktktk**) and then dulls to a single, reluctant **tick… tick** as the cover seats. The wax membrane makes one last wet *suck* against the vent stub and goes still.

But the incense doesn’t stop. It thins for a breath—then resumes, now seeping from the seam around the cover instead of the pinhole. You didn’t end the flow; you just forced it to find another edge.

You pull your sleeve into your mouth. Fabric tastes like old antiseptic and copper. You squeeze the engineer’s ankle hard—*move*—and he moves immediately, scrambling forward on elbows and knees, boots kicking soft dents into the duct’s grit.

You both crawl fast down the warm run.

Behind you, the junction box answers your violence with a delayed reaction: a sharp **CLACK** from inside as if something re-routed. The seam you sealed *pops* once—tiny, not open, but enough to spit a bead of wax that skitters along the duct floor like a pale insect.

Ahead, the **THUD… THUD** becomes directional—closer, slightly left of your line, traveling through the ship’s ribs rather than the duct itself. Whatever is walking isn’t in your crawlspace yet; it’s paralleling you in the structure beyond.

Then the warm-run hum stutters. Lights in the duct—faint maintenance glow through grilles—dip for half a second.

The engineer hisses through his teeth, too quiet to be words, and accelerates until his boot nearly clips your shoulder.

A new sound joins the thuds: a slow, deliberate scrape like something heavy being dragged across a bulkhead—**shrrr… shrrr**—keeping pace with you on the other side of the metal.

You’re moving. You’re not yet caught. But something has your route bracketed: pressure-play behind, weight and scraping ahead-left, and the duct’s power just hiccuped as if the ship noticed you.

#### Turn 146 **[PLAYER]**

I slow just enough to feel for a junction or grille with my fingertips, then press two quick squeezes to the engineer’s ankle—*left/right?*—and point ahead, palm down: *low, quiet*. If I find a service grille or side spur, I mouth into my sleeve, barely a breath: “On three, we drop out—no light, no words,” and start counting on my fingers as I scan for the nearest exit or branch.

*Agent reasoning: It’s pacing us outside the duct; the only advantage we have is silence and misdirection. I need a branch, a drop, or a way to mask our sound—otherwise it will cut us off ahead. Also the engineer is close to breaking; I should give him a simple, physical job.*

#### Turn 147 **[GAME]**

You slow, palms and fingertips skating the duct’s seam-ridges.

Five handspans ahead your fingers find a line of cold rivets and a shallow lip: a **service grille** set into the duct floor, wax-marked at two corners—someone’s been here recently. The metal around it is cooler than the warm run should allow, as if it vents into an unincensed pocket.

You squeeze the engineer’s ankle twice—*left/right?* He answers by twisting his boot toe and angling his knee: **right**, then taps once against the duct wall as if to say *but not far*. He keeps his head down, shoulders bunched, obeying your palm-down *low, quiet* without you needing to repeat it.

You mouth into your sleeve: “On three, we drop out—no light, no words.”

At “one,” you test the grille. It isn’t screwed; it’s **latched**—a spring catch. It gives a millimeter with a soft metallic *tink*.

At “two,” the scrape beyond the metal stops dead, like whatever was dragging itself has paused to listen. The **THUD** footfalls also halt for a single beat.

At “three,” you pull.

The grille drops inward—but not cleanly. A **strand of wax** like a ligament has been smeared across the frame and it stretches, resisting, making a quiet, obscene *rrrk* as it peels. The opening below is a vertical drop of about a meter into a narrow service void—black, with a faint blue console-glow far down the passage.

The engineer commits immediately, sliding feet-first through. His boot catches the wax strand; it snaps with a tiny *pop* that is louder than it should be in the hush.

Instantly, the ship answers.

From the warm-run behind you: the junction-box relay you forced shut earlier erupts into rapid chatter again—faint but unmistakable through the ductwork. From ahead-left, the scrape resumes, faster, now **coming toward the duct line**, and the thuds return—closer, heavier.

As you start to follow the engineer down, something impacts the duct wall near the grille—**a single, hard knock from the outside**, right beside your head. The metal dents inward a fraction, vibrating your teeth.

Whatever is out there has found the drop point. It’s not inside the duct yet—but it’s at arm’s reach through the bulkhead, and it’s testing the skin.

#### Turn 148 **[PLAYER]**

I suck in a tight breath through my sleeve and drop feet-first through the opening after him, twisting my hips to clear fast. As soon as I land, I reach up and yank the grille back toward closed—hard—then press my palm to it like a seal and whisper, almost soundless, “Go. Right. Don’t look back.”

*Agent reasoning: That knock means it’s triangulated us; lingering in the duct is death. I need to get out fast, but I also want to slow it—shut the grille behind me, even if it costs noise. The engineer is already below; I won’t leave him alone in the dark.*

#### Turn 149 **[GAME]**

You drop feet-first into the void. Your boots hit a grated service walkway with a sharp metallic ring you can’t quite smother. The air down here is thinner, colder, and almost free of incense—your lungs notice the absence like a missing limb.

The engineer is already moving right, hunched and fast, one hand skimming the wall for balance. He doesn’t answer, but he obeys.

You jump, grab the grille frame overhead, and haul it up toward closed. It slams into place—almost. The wax strand you tore snaps back like a tacky tendon and wedges in the corner. The grille sits a finger’s width ajar.

You press your palm to it anyway, trying to make your hand into a gasket.

Above your hand, something hits the duct skin again—this time not a knock but a **dragging press**, like knuckles—or a tool—scraping for purchase. The metal vibrates against your palm through the grille.

Then the wax at the corner warms under pressure. It doesn’t melt; it *softens* and begins to **creep**, slowly extruding through the gap. It touches the side of your thumb and adheres with immediate, intimate grip.

A whisper leaks through the finger-width opening—not loud, but perfectly placed, as if the gap is a mouth aimed at your ear. Your teeth ache in sympathetic pulses.

The engineer glances back once despite your order, just a reflex. His eyes catch the wax creeping over your thumb. He flinches hard and mouths, silent: *leave it.*

From farther right, down the service void, a panel light flickers and a voice—human, strained—calls once, low: “Hello? Who’s there?” It’s not the engineer. It’s ahead of him, around the bend.

So the choices tighten in your hands: your palm is holding a grille that won’t fully close, the wax has started to bond to you, something on the other side is actively worrying the duct wall at this exact spot, and there’s a living person (or something using a living voice) in the direction you just sent the engineer.

No alarms. No sirens. Just pressure, wax, and that single human call waiting in the dark.

#### Turn 150 **[PLAYER]**

I peel my thumb away with a sharp twist, sacrificing skin if I have to, and smear the clinging wax onto the grille frame to break the bond. Then I hiss to the engineer, “Keep going—right—don’t stop,” and creep after him low, one hand on the wall, the other raised to my throat as I call back toward the voice, barely audible: “Quiet. Identify yourself. No names—just crew or not?”

*Agent reasoning: The wax is already bonding and the grille won’t seal; staying here makes me the anchor point for whatever’s pushing through. But a human voice ahead could be bait—or someone trapped. I’ll cut myself free, mark the risk, and approach the voice cautiously while keeping the engineer moving.*

#### Turn 151 **[GAME]**

You twist your thumb hard and rip it free.

Skin gives before wax does. A thin crescent tears at the pad—hot, immediate pain—then a wet chill as the air hits it. You smear the clinging wax onto the grille frame with a rough wipe. It holds there, stringing into a tacky fillet along the corner; the gap narrows a fraction but doesn’t seal. Your blood beads and then thickens fast in the cold.

Above, the pressure on the duct skin changes. The dragging stops. In its place comes a careful, *testing* tap-tap at the exact corner you just smeared—like something confirming where you were attached. The metal vibrates faintly; whatever’s up there is not guessing anymore.

You hiss the engineer onward. He goes—half-crouched, fast, shoulders tight—making only the softest clatter of boot on grate. He doesn’t look back again.

You creep after him, one hand on the wall. The service void is narrow enough that your knuckles brush conduit clamps; the cold metal leaves a faint dampness on your skin.

You call back, barely audible: “Quiet. Identify yourself. No names—just crew or not?”

A beat. Then the voice answers from around the bend, still low, but closer than it should be given the distance: “Crew. Concord. Medic.” The cadence is wrong—too even, like it’s been practiced. “We’re trapped. Door sealed. Don’t—don’t bring lights.”

As it speaks, a panel two meters ahead on your right blinks once—blue to dark—like a blinked eye. The engineer slows despite your order, drawn by the bend and the promise of an ally.

Behind you, up at the grille, something finally finds leverage. A single, blunt **impact** dents the duct wall inward with a metallic *gong*, and dust sifts down through the gap you failed to close. The wax fillet you smeared **shivers**, then begins to pull *back upward*, as if being reeled from the other side.

Whatever is on the duct line has started opening your exit from above—quietly, methodically—and it knows you’re no longer attached to the wax.

The “Concord medic” ahead waits in the dark, insisting on no light, while the thing behind you works the grille like a patient hand on a latch.

#### Turn 152 **[PLAYER]**

I grab the engineer’s sleeve hard and pull him down against the wall, shaking my head once—*no*—then I whisper, “It’s bait. Don’t answer.”

Keeping my back to the bend, I speak toward the voice, flat and quiet: “What color is triage tag for immediate? And what’s the first drug in Concord seizure protocol—no doses.” 

Then I edge to that blinking panel and press my bloodied thumb beside it like a crude ward, listening for the grille behind us while I feel for a manual override or a way to kill the light without making noise.

*Agent reasoning: The “medic” voice feels rehearsed and the blinking panel reads like the ship watching; I won’t let the engineer walk into a mouth while our only retreat is being reopened. I need to slow pursuit, create a barrier at the bend, and test the voice with something only real crew would answer—without giving my name.*

I clamp a hand on the engineer’s sleeve and drag him tight to the wall, shake my head once. “Bait. Don’t answer.”

Toward the bend, I keep my voice flat and low: “What color is triage tag for immediate? And what’s the first drug in Concord seizure protocol—no doses.”

I edge to the blinking panel and press my bloodied thumb beside it like a crude ward, then feel along its seam for a manual latch or kill-switch, trying to dead the light without a click—while I tilt my head back toward the grille, listening for metal giving way.

*Agent reasoning: The “medic” voice feels too rehearsed; testing with procedural questions is safer than approaching. The blinking panel could be a lure or a control point—I'd rather smother it and find a silent manual override while tracking the grille’s progress behind us.*

#### Turn 155 **[GAME]**

Your grip on the engineer’s sleeve yanks him flush to the wall. He startles, then goes still, swallowing whatever impulse he had to call out. He keeps his eyes on the bend like it might sprout hands.

You ask your questions into the dark.

The reply comes after a beat, softer now, as if it had to lean closer to be heard: “Immediate is… red.” A pause that’s a fraction too long. “Seizure protocol—diazepam.”

The answers are *plausible*. The cadence still isn’t: no breath hitch, no irritation, no *human* impatience at being tested while “trapped.”

You slide to the blinking panel. It’s a narrow service access plate with a single status pip—blue when it sees motion, dark when it sleeps. Your bloodied thumb presses beside it; the metal drinks your heat. The blood smears and immediately begins to tack, as if the panel’s paint is slightly adhesive.

You feel along the seam. There’s a recessed manual catch—old, mechanical. You ease a fingernail into it and lift with slow pressure, trying to avoid the snap.

It doesn’t click.

It **sighs**.

The seam opens a millimeter on its own, like a mouth parting. Cold air exhales from inside the panel, and with it a thin thread of incense-sweetness that doesn’t belong down here. The blue pip goes dark—dead—without sound.

Your thumbprint, left in blood, *stays* warm a second too long. The warmth crawls along the smear in a branching pattern, like capillaries deciding where to grow.

Behind you, at the grille, metal finally yields with a drawn-out **tear**—not a crash, but a controlled rip. Something has peeled a corner back. You hear the scrape of material sliding through: not claws on metal, but **wax on steel**, intimate and sticky.

The engineer’s eyes widen. He points, trembling, at the floor near your boot: a droplet has fallen from above—wax-laced condensation—landing and spreading into a small, glossy oval. It quivers once, as if listening.

From the bend, the “medic” speaks again, closer than before and now with a faint overlay, like two voices sharing one throat: “Don’t bring lights, Doctor.”

It used your title. No one down here should know it.

#### Turn 156 **[PLAYER]**

I go ice-still, then lean into the engineer’s ear. “Hold your breath. Follow my hand. If you hear me sing—run.”

Without looking at the bend, I wet my torn thumb on my tongue and smear a quick cross of blood over the quivering wax oval by my boot, then slide my fingers into the panel seam and whisper into it—not a name, just a scrap of psalm in the cathedral-ship’s cadence—to *draw* attention here.

Then I pull the engineer with me to the right, moving low and fast along the wall, aiming for the next junction or hatch—no lights, no more words.

*Agent reasoning: It knows me—talking will only give it more shape. The panel feels like a throat; if it’s an access into the ship’s nerves, I can use it to misdirect. We need distance and silence, not answers.*

#### Turn 157 **[GAME]**

The engineer nods once, tight and frantic, and pinches his nostrils shut with two fingers like he’s done it before in smoke. He keeps his mouth closed, cheeks hollowing as he holds.

You wet your torn thumb. Salt stings the cut. You smear a quick, crooked cross through the glossy wax oval.

The wax reacts immediately: it *tightens* under the blood, drawing inward as if the smear is a stitch. The quiver stops. For one clean second it looks inert—then the surface dimples, forming a tiny concavity like an ear pressed into skin.

You hook your fingers into the panel seam and whisper the psalm-fragment—just cadence and shape, no name.

Inside the panel, something answers with a soft, wet **chime**, like a throat clearing in metal. The cold breath from the seam deepens; your whisper comes back to you a half-beat late, harmonized wrong, as if the ship is trying your voice on for size.

At the bend, the “medic” stops speaking.

Then it moves.

Footsteps—barely there—cross the grate toward the panel, not toward you. The sound is wrong: too many points of contact, like a person walking while dragging a second set of joints behind them. As it approaches, the air pressure shifts; your ears pop slightly.

Above, at the peeled grille, the wax-on-steel scrape accelerates, but also *reorients*—whatever was working the grille now tracks toward the panel’s position, drawn by what you fed it.

You pull the engineer right, low and fast. He follows by your hand, stumbling once when his boot hits a raised conduit strap; he catches himself without a curse, breath still held, eyes watering.

Ten meters down the right run, the wall breaks into a **wheel-lock hatch**—maintenance round, half-frosted, with a manual handwheel and a wax seal that’s been scored and re-scored by anxious fingers. It’s real, physical, and closed.

Behind you, at the panel, something exhales—audible now—and the blue status pip you killed flares **once** from inside the seam, shining through like a thin line of bioluminescence. The “medic” voice speaks into the panel, not into the corridor:

“Sing.”

And the grille behind you gives one final, decisive **pop** as a corner comes free. Something drops—light, sticky—onto the deck where you were standing, and begins to *slide* after you without footsteps.

#### Turn 158 **[PLAYER]**

I clamp both hands on the wheel-lock hatch and start turning—slow at first, then harder—mouthing to the engineer, “Now,” so he helps without breathing. As the sticky slide closes in, I let out a thin, off-key thread of the cathedral psalm—not full song, just enough to lure it back toward the panel—while I keep my body between it and him. “Through the moment it cracks,” I whisper, and shove my shoulder into the hatch as soon as the seal gives.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is our only hard barrier; singing is a trap but my psalm-cadence can also misdirect. I need the engineer alive, and I’d rather risk my voice than let that wax reach him.*

#### Turn 160 **[PLAYER]**

I clamp both hands on the wheel-lock and start turning—slow, then brutal—mouthing at the engineer, “Now,” so he throws his weight in beside me without taking a breath. As the sticky slide nears, I leak a thin, off-key thread of cathedral psalm—barely a lure, not a hymn—angling it back toward the panel while I keep my body between it and him. “Through the moment it cracks,” I whisper, and the instant the seal gives I slam my shoulder into the hatch and shove it open enough to spill us through.

*Agent reasoning: The wax-thing is sliding in fast and the “medic” is trying to make me sing; the hatch is our only hard barrier, so I’ll force it open while using the smallest psalm-thread to pull the pursuit back toward the panel, keeping myself between it and the engineer.*

#### Turn 161 **[GAME]**

The wheel fights you like it’s packed with grit. You turn it a quarter, then another—metal groaning, frost shedding in brittle flakes. The engineer crowds in on your right, both hands on the spokes, jaw clenched, cheeks hollow from held breath. Together you wrench.

The wax seal on the hatch face doesn’t “break” so much as **unstick**—a wet, reluctant peel. A thin filament stretches from hatch to frame and snaps, spattering your sleeve with warmish droplets that cool instantly.

Your off-key psalm-thread leaves your throat like a leak. The corridor answers: the panel seam behind you gives a soft, pleased **chime**, and the sliding thing hesitates—its motion stuttering as if it’s deciding which sound to obey.

Then it commits.

The glossy smear on the deck *reverses direction* in a smooth, unnatural glide, drawn back toward the panel. As it moves, it leaves a faint wet track that steams for a second in the cold air.

But it doesn’t go alone.

From the peeled ceiling grille, something heavier drops—an irregular lump of wax and condensation with a hint of fabric caught inside it—and lands with a slap two meters behind you. It doesn’t slide. It **scrabbles**, making tiny suction pops as it gathers itself and starts coming your way in short, fast pulls.

The wheel-lock finally hits its stop with a hard **clunk**. The hatch releases a finger-width—enough for a knife of colder air to cut out, carrying the clean, dead smell of unincensed maintenance space.

You slam your shoulder in. The hatch swings inward grudgingly, then faster, and you and the engineer spill through into darkness lit only by a weak amber service strip. The engineer’s breath finally breaks—one sharp, involuntary inhale that sounds like pain.

Behind you, the scrabbling thing reaches the threshold just as the hatch moves. A strip of wax lashes out from it—fast as a thrown cord—and **sticks to the edge of the hatch**, trying to hold it open.

Your shove wins by inches. The hatch swings far enough to shear the wax-strip with a wet snap, and you kick the wheel with your heel as it starts to swing back toward closed.

On the other side, something bumps the hatch once—testing—then again, harder. The metal dents inward slightly with the second hit.

The engineer, eyes wide and watering, whispers hoarsely: “That wasn’t… that wasn’t a person.”

The wheel-lock hatch is mostly closed, but not yet dogged tight. Whatever is outside is now **actively pushing against it**.

#### Turn 162 **[PLAYER]**

I grab the wheel with both hands and dog it shut hard, teeth clenched. “Help me—push on the spokes, don’t look at the dent,” I hiss to the engineer, then press my ear to the hatch a heartbeat, listening for breath or scraping as I scan the compartment for a secondary panel, vent, or crawlspace.

*Agent reasoning: If we don’t dog the wheel, it’ll force its way in; the engineer is panicking, so I need to give him something simple while I listen for what we’re dealing with and look for a second exit.*

#### Turn 163 **[GAME]**

You and the engineer throw your weight onto the wheel together. The spokes bite your palms; the metal is so cold it feels briefly tacky, like it wants to take skin.

Outside, something hits the hatch again—**once**, then a dragging shove that tries to keep pressure on the seam. The wheel turns anyway, slow but inexorable, until the dogs seat with a final, ugly **thunk**. The hatch stops moving. The pressure from the other side keeps coming for another second, then slips, as if whatever’s out there lost purchase.

You press your ear to the metal.

No human breath. Instead: a faint, rhythmic **squeal**—wax on steel—circling the hatch’s perimeter, testing for gaps. Between squeals, a soft clicking like knuckles tapping in different places, not quite random.

The engineer keeps his face turned away from the dent, exactly as you told him. His eyes are shut tight. He whispers through clenched teeth, “It’s… *feeling* for the latch.”

You scan the unincensed compartment. It’s a squat service cell: bare ribs of conduit, a dead console with its cover missing, and a waist-high manifold wrapped in frost. On the left bulkhead is a **secondary service panel** with a simple lever-lock and a stamped label: **RETURN AIR / BYPASS**. Above it, a rectangular **vent throat** the size of your shoulders, its grille held by two quarter-turn fasteners—one already loosened, hanging at an angle like someone started to open it and stopped.

On the deck near the manifold sits a small maintenance case with a Choirwarden-style wax tally on it (three short burns, one long). Not yours. Not Concord issue.

Outside the hatch, the squeal stops. Silence for two beats.

Then, very gently, a voice you recognize as the “medic”—too calm, too close to the metal—speaks through the hatch as if into your inner ear: “Elara. Open.”

The engineer flinches at your name, eyes snapping open. “How the hell—”

Something presses flat against the hatch from the other side, and the dent bulges inward a fraction, as if a face is being applied to the metal to listen back.

#### Turn 164 **[PLAYER]**

I flinch at my name but don’t answer; instead I grab the engineer by the collar and drag him under the vent. “No matter what it says—silent.”  
I snatch up the wax-tallied maintenance case, then flip the RETURN AIR / BYPASS lever-lock and throw it to BYPASS, listening for any shift in airflow; with my other hand I twist the remaining quarter-turn fastener and shove the vent grille up. “You first—crawl. Don’t stop.”

*Agent reasoning: The voice knowing my name is a lure; I need movement options. The vent throat is an escape route, and the return-air bypass might let me redirect pressure/scent/sound away from this hatch. The wax-tallied case could hold tools or a ward—worth grabbing fast.*

#### Turn 165 **[GAME]**

You haul the engineer under the vent throat. He goes stiff at first—reflex to resist—then nods hard when you say *silent*, lips pressing into a thin line like he’s biting down on a scream.

You snatch the wax-tallied maintenance case. It’s heavier than it looks, and it’s warm at the handle, as if it’s been held recently.

At the RETURN AIR / BYPASS panel, the lever-lock gives with a sharp snap of spring metal. You throw it to **BYPASS**.

The compartment answers immediately: the amber strip-light flickers once, and the air changes direction with an audible **huff**—a low suction that pulls cold along the deck toward the vent throat. Frost on the manifold feathers outward, then collapses as airflow strips it.

On the other side of the hatch, the “medic” voice stops. In its place comes a thin, eager **inhalation**—too long, too steady—like something tasting the new current through microscopic seams.

You twist the remaining quarter-turn fastener. It’s already loose enough to turn with two fingers. The grille lifts, scraping metal on metal, and a spill of colder, cleaner air pours down from the duct.

The engineer climbs first, elbows and knees, boots scraping as he wedges himself into the shoulder-width throat. He looks back once—eyes wet, jaw trembling—and you catch him forcing himself not to speak. Then he crawls, fast.

As his boots vanish, the hatch behind you **ticks**—one of the dogs shifting under pressure. Not opening, but being *tested*. A soft wet sound follows, like wax being pressed into the wheel’s housing.

Then the voice returns, no longer pretending to be the medic. It’s layered—two tones slightly out of sync, one of them familiar in a way that makes your stomach drop.

“Elara,” it says again, gently. “You changed the breath. You always change the breath.”

The maintenance case in your hand gives a faint internal rattle—glass against glass—then a single, delicate **tap** from inside, as if something heard its name and answered.

The vent is open. The bypass is pulling. The hatch is being worked on from the other side—quietly, methodically.

#### Turn 166 **[PLAYER]**

I swallow the spike of recognition and whisper back, barely breath: “Not yours.” Then I wedge the maintenance case against my chest, haul myself up into the vent after the engineer, and pull the grille down as far as it will sit—quietly—before crawling hard into the dark, following his boot-scrapes and the tug of the bypassed air.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch won’t hold forever and the voice is trying to hook me emotionally; I need to get into the duct with the engineer, but the warm case and the tapping could be a lure or a clue—bring it, but don’t open it here.*

#### Turn 167 **[GAME]**

“Not yours,” you breathe—so small it’s more vibration than sound.

On the far side of the hatch, the layered voice goes utterly still, as if it’s listening to the shape of your refusal. Then, very softly, it answers with your own cadence stolen clean: “Not mine.”

You haul yourself into the vent with the case pinned to your chest. The duct bites at your shoulders; cold metal snags fabric. The bypass pull helps, a steady tug that makes your hair lift and your eyes water. Ahead, the engineer’s boots scrape fast—panic-contained, moving like someone who’s decided stopping is death.

You ease the grille down behind you. It doesn’t seat flush—one corner hangs a finger-width proud where the fastener was already loosened—but it settles enough to look closed at a glance. The scrape is quiet.

Two body-lengths into the dark, the maintenance case taps again from inside—one precise knock—then a faint, glassy clink as something shifts to follow the new orientation. The handle warms further against your wrist.

Behind the grille: a sound like a wet palm smoothing over metal. Then a thin, deliberate *click*—not the hatch this time, but the lever mechanism you threw to BYPASS being touched from the other side of the compartment.

The airflow changes.

It doesn’t stop, but it **stutters**, as if someone is pulsing the bypass to “taste” your movement. The duct’s pull becomes a series of gentle surges that catch at your clothes and make crawling uneven—push, drag, push.

The engineer reacts immediately: his boots scrape faster, then he slips on condensation and bangs a knee. He clamps his mouth shut hard enough you hear teeth click, and he keeps going.

From below, through the thin vent metal, the layered voice drifts after you—not loud, but perfectly placed, like it’s riding the duct resonance: “You brought it with you.”

A new sound joins it: a faint, rapid **scrabbling** on the underside of the duct, keeping pace for a moment—wax on vent skin—then falling behind as the airflow surges again.

You are in the vent, moving. The compartment below is no longer static; someone—or something—has hands on your bypass control, and something else is trying to track you along the duct from beneath.

“Keep crawling—steady. Don’t race the surges,” I whisper to the engineer, then tap back on the maintenance case in the same rhythm it tapped me, like a false reply. I wedge the case hard against the duct wall to make it clatter and scrape while I reach one hand down to feel for a damper latch or access seam—anything I can jam open—then shove forward on the next airflow pulse, trying to desync our movement from their “tasting.”

*Agent reasoning: The pulsing airflow is being used to track us; I need to break that feedback loop and keep the engineer from panicking. The case is suspicious and “alive,” so I’ll use it as a decoy/noise source and try to force a constant flow by jamming the duct or reaching a manual damper.*

“Steady—don’t race the surges,” I murmur to the engineer, forcing my breath slow. I tap the maintenance case back in its exact rhythm, then grind it against the duct wall to make a messy clatter while my free hand feels along the seam for a damper latch—anything to jam open—and I shove forward only on the next pulse, trying to break whatever pattern it’s reading.

*Agent reasoning: The surging airflow feels like it’s being used to track us; I want to keep the engineer calm, mislead whatever’s listening with noise from the case, and physically sabotage the duct control so we can crawl on our own rhythm.*

#### Turn 171 **[GAME]**

The engineer hears you. His pace changes immediately: the frantic boot-scrapes become measured—three pulls, pause, three pulls—matching your steadier breathing. He doesn’t look back, but he gives a tight thumbs-up without stopping.

You tap the case in the exact rhythm it tapped you.

For a half-second, the case answers—*tap*—perfectly aligned, like a duet.

Then it stops.

Not fading; stopping like a held breath. The warmth at the handle spikes, sharp and quick, and the case gives a small internal shudder, glass clicking once as if something inside shifted its weight.

You grind the case against the duct wall. The noise is satisfyingly ugly: metal rasp, a clatter that rings down the run. It does what you wanted—below you, the scrabbling sound hesitates, then darts to the side, as if whatever was tracking by vibration just lost its clean line.

Your free hand finds a seam: a narrow, riveted access strip running lengthwise. Half a meter ahead of your shoulder there’s a spring latch—industrial, meant for a tech’s gloved thumb. You hook it with two fingers and pull.

It opens.

A small damper iris inside flips from mostly-closed to yawning wide, and the duct **gulps** hard. The next airflow pulse becomes a sustained pull, strong enough to tug at your sleeve and drag loose dust past your face in a cold ribbon.

Consequence: the “tasting” pattern breaks—no more neat surges. But the price is immediate and physical.

The engineer, just ahead, is caught by the sudden sustained suction. His boots skid; his knee that he hit earlier slips again. He smacks his shoulder into the duct wall with a muffled grunt and nearly wedges sideways. He claws forward and manages not to block the run, but he’s slowed and breathing through his nose like it hurts.

Below the metal, something answers the change: a wet, deliberate *slap* against the duct underside, closer than before, followed by a dragging sound—wax or soft flesh being pulled along the seam you just opened.

And the layered voice shifts—no longer behind you, but *under* you, directly beneath the open damper, as if it found your new mouth in the airflow.

“You opened a throat,” it says, almost approving. “Now it can speak back.”

Through the open damper, you hear a new sound from somewhere off-run: a thin chorus-thread, not words, just a tonal rise—like a distant alarm that’s learning to be a hymn. The duct metal vibrates with it, and your teeth ache in sympathy.

You have created a strong, steady pull forward and broken the surging “read,” but you’ve also given whatever’s below a direct acoustic/air path to you—and it’s closing distance along the underside of the duct.

#### Turn 172 **[PLAYER]**

I grab the engineer’s boot and shove hard to get him past the snag, then hiss, “Move—pain later.” As soon as he’s clear, I slap the damper latch back toward closed with my palm, and whisper down into it, low and venomous, “No choir. Not through me,” before crawling on, keeping the case tight and my ears pinned against the rising tone.

*Agent reasoning: I can’t let the engineer get stuck, and the open damper is now a conduit for the hymn/contagion; I’ll prioritize getting him moving and then choking off the “throat” even if it means losing the steady pull.*

#### Turn 173 **[GAME]**

Your hand clamps the engineer’s boot heel and you shove with everything the duct gives you. He jolts forward, shoulder scraping loud, then he finds purchase—boots thumping twice—clearing the snag by a handspan. He gasps, “—Got it,” through clenched teeth, and keeps moving, no argument.

You slam your palm onto the latch to force it back.

It doesn’t swing cleanly. Something below is **pulling on it**—not strong enough to hold it open against you, but enough to make it feel elastic and wrong, like closing a jaw that’s biting back. You win the struggle in a short, ugly burst: the damper iris snaps toward shut with a metallic *clack* that rings in your wrist bones.

The sustained suction collapses back into smaller, uneven pulses.

For one breath, the tone you heard through the opening drops away, muffled—then it returns, fainter but still present, now traveling through the duct itself rather than the damper. The metal around you carries it like a tuning fork.

You whisper down anyway: “No choir. Not through me.”

From directly beneath the damper seam comes an immediate reply: not words—**a wet exhale** that fogs the underside of the duct, followed by a slow drag as whatever was there slides away… then a sharper, faster scrabble as it relocates.

A second later, the underside of the duct **bumps** once, hard, almost like a shoulder-check from below. Dust jumps. The maintenance case in your grip gives a startled internal clink.

Ahead, the engineer flinches at the impact and starts to speed up despite himself. You hear him whisper, rapid and scared, “What is that—what is that—” then he forces it down to a hiss as if afraid sound will feed it.

Behind you—faint, back the way you came—the grille you eased into place earlier gives a small, delayed *tick… tick… tick*, like someone testing the corner that didn’t seat flush.

Threat is now split: something is tracking **under** the duct and has started testing it physically, and something else is behind, working at the imperfectly closed grille. The airflow pulses continue, but they’re no longer “tasting” in a neat rhythm—they’re agitated, irregular, like the system is being played by hands rather than timers.

#### Turn 174 **[PLAYER]**

I hiss to the engineer, “It’s the ship listening—don’t name it,” then shove my hand forward to grip his ankle once, anchoring his pace. I wrench the maintenance case back behind me and jam it hard under a cross-brace in the duct, letting it clatter loudly, then scrape my nails along the metal as I crawl on—trying to leave the sound and the “tap” behind. “Don’t look back,” I whisper, and keep moving into the dark, counting my breaths against the hymn in the steel.

*Agent reasoning: I can’t let him panic and make noise, and I need to buy time by making the pursuer behind commit to the wrong path; sacrificing the case as a decoy hurts, but it’s better than letting it ride my ribs like a beacon.*

#### Turn 175 **[GAME]**

“It’s the ship listening—don’t name it.”

The engineer’s breathing hitches at the word *ship*, but he obeys the real instruction: he stops forming questions. He nods once—jerky, unseen except in the way his shoulders tighten—and keeps crawling.

You catch his ankle, a brief clamp that forces his pace back into something you can match. He gives a quiet, pained exhale but doesn’t shake you off.

Then you wrench the wax-tallied maintenance case behind you and jam it under a cross-brace.

It goes in with a brutal, satisfying **clang**—and then a second sound you didn’t intend: the case’s latch pops half a notch with a brittle *tink*, like it resented being pinned. Something inside rattles and settles.

The duct answers immediately.

From below, the thing that had been dragging along the underside **reorients** toward the noise. You feel it in the metal before you hear it: a vibration that tightens to a point, then a wet, deliberate *slap-slap* as it moves under the brace. It doesn’t just follow the clatter—it commits to it.

Behind you, at the imperfectly seated grille, the testing *tick* stops. Replaced by a slow, careful **scrape**—someone (or something) now working with patience, not probing.

You scrape your nails along the metal as you crawl on. The sound is thin and ugly. It does what you wanted: it muddies your immediate acoustic “shape.” The hymn in the steel becomes harder to separate from your own noise.

But the ship doesn’t lose you entirely.

As you move into the darker run, the rising tone in the duct shifts pitch to match the cadence of your counted breaths—close enough to be coincidence, exact enough to feel like mockery.

Ahead, the engineer whispers without turning, “Case—” then bites the word off, as if naming it might invite it. He swallows and forces out, “We’re… leaving it?”

Another hard **bump** strikes the underside of the duct where you jammed the case, followed by the tortured squeal of metal under pressure. Not enough to tear through—yet—but enough to tell you the threat is now focused there, worrying at the brace like an animal at a trap.

You are moving forward, but you’ve traded one danger for two clear ones:
- **Below you**, something physical is now attacking the cross-brace and the pinned case, trying to get at the noise you left behind.
- **Behind you**, something patient is working the mis-seated grille, and it’s no longer “testing”—it’s opening.

“We’re leaving it,” I whisper, flat as a scalpel. “If you pray, do it silently.”

I crawl up close behind him, palm between his shoulder blades to keep him from rushing, and sweep my fingers along the duct edges for the next access seam or junction—listening for a change in echo that means a drop shaft or grate. Without looking back, I add, quieter, “When we find a hatch, you go first. If it sings your name, don’t answer.”

*Agent reasoning: I can’t let him fixate on the case or slow down; we need distance and a safer exit point. I’m shaken by leaving it, but it’s bought us seconds—so I’ll harden my voice, keep him moving, and start hunting for the next access drop while the thing is distracted.*

#### Turn 177 **[GAME]**

“We’re leaving it.”

The engineer’s shoulders twitch under your palm, a reflex to turn—he doesn’t. He swallows hard enough you hear it, then nods once. His hands keep moving in the crawl pattern like he’s reciting a drill.

“If you pray, do it silently.”

He exhales through his nose—almost a laugh, but it breaks into a tremor. He doesn’t speak again.

You press in close, guiding him by the center of his back so he doesn’t bolt. Your other hand sweeps the duct edges: rivet lines, seams, the occasional patch plate. You listen for the telltale change—hollow drop, a grille’s thin resonance, a junction’s wider throat.

Two meters on, your fingertips find an access seam: a narrow rectangular plate with a wax smear along one corner, as if someone sealed it in a hurry. When you tap it accidentally with your nail, the echo is wrong—deeper, with a vertical tail.

A drop shaft.

As you pass it, the metal around that plate carries the hymn differently: the tone you’ve been counting against *thins*, then returns a half-step higher, as if it climbed.

Behind you, the duct shudders—distant but distinct—followed by a snapping *ping* of stressed metal. The pinned maintenance case is being worried hard now. Whatever is under the duct is strong enough to deform the brace, and it’s staying with the decoy rather than chasing you—so far.

But the second threat keeps working.

From farther back, beyond where you left the case, comes a soft, steady sound like fabric dragged over mesh. Then: the unmistakable **click** of a grille corner giving way.

Not loud. Not sudden. Deliberate.

“When we find a hatch, you go first,” you tell him. “If it sings your name, don’t answer.”

The engineer finally whispers, barely audible: “It already did.” He doesn’t elaborate—just crawls faster for three strokes before your palm reins him in.

At the drop-shaft plate, the wax smear is fresh enough to dent under your fingertip. There’s a thumb-sized gap at the edge where you could lever it if you had space.

Then, from that plate—right beside your hand—comes a sound that isn’t air or metal: a human voice reduced to a near-perfect imitation, intimate and close, speaking the engineer’s name in his own cadence.

He freezes so hard the duct seems to freeze with him.

The threat is now clear and immediate: the drop shaft is “active,” and it can produce targeted voices. If he answers—or even reacts too loudly—it has a line on you both.

#### Turn 178 **[PLAYER]**

I clamp my hand over the engineer’s mouth and press my forehead briefly to his shoulder, a hard, grounding contact—then I squeeze twice: *don’t answer*.  
In his ear I breathe, not words, just a slow exhale he can match, and with my other hand I hook a nail into the thumb-gap and peel the waxed plate up just enough to listen down the drop without speaking; if it’s clear, I shove the plate wider and point him through first, guiding him by the belt to keep him silent.

*Agent reasoning: The drop shaft is baiting him with his own name; the safest move is to break his freeze without letting him vocalize, and to avoid engaging the mimic. If we can silently redirect into the shaft, it may also sever the line from behind—but opening it could be a trap, so I’ll test and commit quickly, using touch signals and breath control.*

#### Turn 179 **[GAME]**

Your palm seals the engineer’s mouth. He jerks once—pure panic—then your forehead hits his shoulder like a command and you squeeze twice.

He understands. His throat works under your hand, but he doesn’t answer the voice. He forces his breathing to match your slow exhale, shallow at first, then steadier.

You hook a nail into the thumb-gap and peel.

The wax doesn’t tear clean. It stretches in a stringy ribbon, resisting like warm resin, and the plate lifts with a reluctant squeal. Cold air spills up from the crack—air that smells *unincensed*, raw metal and stagnant condensation.

You hold your face close to the opening and listen down without speaking.

There is space below—vertical, maybe three meters—then a wider cavity. You can hear a faint drip and the distant, irregular pulse of fans. No immediate footsteps. No obvious machinery right under the hatch.

But the voice returns, now from *below* the plate, perfectly placed: the engineer’s name again, soft as a lover waking him. It isn’t a shout—it’s bait designed for exactly this distance.

The engineer’s eyes squeeze shut. He makes a small sound against your palm—almost a whimper. You feel his jaw try to move, then stop.

Behind you in the duct, something scrapes closer—light, careful contact on metal, not the heavy bumping from below earlier. This is different: **a crawler in the duct**, using hands or hooked tools, coming from the direction of the loosened grille. It’s still out of sight, but it’s near enough that the vibrations have a rhythm—pause, slide, pause—like it’s listening between movements.

You shove the plate wider. The wax tears with a quiet snap and the plate swings up enough to pass a body.

You point him through first and take his belt.

He starts to wriggle down, silent, obeying—then freezes halfway as the voice below shifts to something worse: not his name, but a clipped, official Concord cadence: “Engineer—status check. Respond.”

His training almost answers for him. You feel the reflex in his abdomen and ribs through the belt: a preparatory breath.

At the same moment, the crawler behind you stops moving entirely.

The threat is now immediate and specific:
- **Below the drop**, the ship (or something in it) is using *targeted voices*—personal and official—to trigger a response.
- **Behind you**, an unseen duct-crawler has closed in and is waiting for any sound or movement to locate you precisely.

#### Turn 180 **[PLAYER]**

I clamp harder over his mouth and bite out a whisper into his ear, “Not Concord. Not your supervisor. Breathe—down,” then jab two fingers sharply into the nerve under his jaw to break the reflex and shove his hips through the opening by the belt. As soon as his boots clear, I let myself slide after him and yank the waxed plate down as I go, forcing it toward closed between us and the duct—no words, just a tight, furious exhale into the dark below.

*Agent reasoning: If he answers, we’re marked; if we hesitate, the crawler behind will strike. I need to override his reflex with touch and get him down fast, then deny the duct-crawler a target by closing the plate and dropping after him.*

#### Turn 181 **[GAME]**

Your hand clamps down until the engineer’s lips blanch. Your whisper lands in the only place he can’t avoid it—bone and inner ear.

“Not Concord. Not your supervisor. Breathe—down.”

Two fingers spear under his jaw. His whole face tightens; the reflexive breath catches and collapses into a pained, involuntary swallow. It’s ugly, but it works: the automatic “reply” never forms.

You shove his hips through by the belt. He drops the last half-meter with a muffled thud and a sharp, contained gasp through his nose. He stays quiet.

You follow immediately, sliding down the shaft after him.

The cold is worse inside the drop: bare metal slick with condensation, no incense to soften it. Your boots scrape once on the wall—too loud in the confined tube—and you feel, rather than hear, the duct above go still in response.

As you descend, you yank the waxed plate toward closed.

It does not seat.

The wax you tore has bunched at the hinge edge, and the plate catches on it—stopping with a thin, metallic *tang* and leaving a finger-width slit open to the duct. You can force it lower, but you don’t have leverage mid-drop. The slit remains, a narrow listening wound.

You land beside the engineer in a cramped service cavity: a vertical maintenance well that opens into a shoulder-wide passage. The floor is gridded, wet, and cold enough that your soles briefly stick. A fan somewhere deeper turns with an uneven bearing, *whirr…tick…whirr*.

The engineer doubles over, one hand at his jaw, eyes wide and watering. He mouths soundlessly, then manages a whisper: “Thank you.” It comes out as breath, not voice.

Above you, through the slit, something moves.

Not a voice now—something physical. A thin, jointed shape crosses the gap, blocking the faint light for a heartbeat. You hear a delicate, deliberate tap-tap against the plate, as if testing the seal you failed to make. Then a sound like a fingernail dragged along metal, tracing the slit’s length.

The threat is clear: the duct-crawler is at the hatch, and the plate isn’t fully closed. It knows exactly where you dropped.

#### Turn 182 **[PLAYER]**

I grab the engineer’s collar and drag him a step into the passage, then shove him behind me with a sharp look. “No sound,” I mouth more than speak.  

I jump, hook my fingers into the edge of the plate from below, and force it down hard—grinding the bunched wax with my thumb until it smears flat enough to seat—then I press my ear to the metal for one heartbeat, listening for the crawler’s position.  

Without waiting, I pull the engineer along the shoulder-wide passage toward the fan’s uneven *whirr…tick…whirr*, keeping my steps light on the wet grating.

*Agent reasoning: The slit is a beacon; I need it sealed now, even if it costs me skin, and I need the engineer moving before panic makes noise.*

#### Turn 183 **[GAME]**

You haul the engineer one step into the passage and shove him behind you. He nods fast, jaw clenched, both hands up like he’s physically holding his own silence in place.

You jump and catch the plate’s lower edge. Your fingers slip once on condensation, then bite. You force it down hard.

The wax grinds under your thumb—warm, tacky—and finally smears flat enough that the plate drops into its frame with a solid **clack**. The sound is loud in the tight shaft.

For one heartbeat you press your ear to the metal.

On the other side: a pause, then a slow, careful repositioning—**scrape of something jointed**, and a faint, dry clicking like nails or hooks finding purchase. It’s directly above the hatch, centered. Then a soft tap-tap-tap that isn’t random: it’s mapping the edges, confirming the seal.

A thin vibration runs through the plate—pressure, testing. It doesn’t open, but you feel the insistence.

You don’t wait. You pull the engineer down the shoulder-wide passage toward the fan’s uneven *whirr…tick…whirr*. Your steps are light on the wet grating; the engineer’s are not at first—his boot slips, catches with a small metallic **skit**—and you feel him flinch behind you, terrified he’s just announced you.

Nothing shouts after you. No voice calls your names.

Instead, behind you, the sealed hatch receives a single, deliberate impact—**thunk**—followed by the sound of something sliding away, retreating upward into the ductwork. It’s not giving up. It’s repositioning.

Ahead, the passage bends around a rib of bulkhead plating. The air grows colder and cleaner, and the fan noise resolves into a nearer source: a service fan mounted behind a grille, its bearing failing on every third rotation. Beside it, a narrow side-door sits half-aj ar, with a painted warning in faded Concord stencil: **RETURN AIR / BYPASS**.

The threat now: whatever was in the duct is no longer at the hatch—you’ve bought seconds, not safety. It’s moving through the duct network to get ahead of you, and the fan/grille area is the next obvious point where it can listen and drop in.

#### Turn 184 **[PLAYER]**

I pull the engineer into the shadow beside the half-open **RETURN AIR / BYPASS** door and press two fingers to my own lips, then to his—*quiet, now*. I ease the door open just enough for us to slip through, pausing to listen at the fan grille for any hitch that isn’t the bad bearing, any extra tap or breath on the other side. If it sounds clear, I guide him inside first by the sleeve, keeping my body between him and the grille as we enter.

*Agent reasoning: The fan/grille is an ambush point and the half-open bypass door is cover; I need silence and a quick plan, and I trust my ears more than speed.*

#### Turn 185 **[GAME]**

You pull him into the thin shadow cast by the fan housing. He’s shaking, but he mirrors you—two fingers to his own lips, then clamps his mouth shut with his palm as if that helps.

You ease the **RETURN AIR / BYPASS** door open. The hinge complains anyway: a brief, wet **creak** like metal rubbing on old wax. You stop and listen at the fan grille.

The bearing’s rhythm is still there—*whirr…tick…whirr*—but underneath it you catch something that isn’t mechanical: a faint, intermittent **tapping** that doesn’t line up with the fan cycle. Three light contacts, a pause, then two. Like someone’s fingers testing spacing.

Then—very close to the grille—an exhale that fogs the metal from the other side. Not a human breath with warmth; it’s cold, dry, and too controlled, as if whatever is behind there doesn’t need air but knows you do.

The engineer’s eyes go huge. He clamps his jaw so hard you hear a tiny click.

You commit anyway, guiding him in first by the sleeve, keeping yourself between him and the grille.

Inside is a narrow bypass compartment: waist-high ducting, a service console with a dead screen, and a floor drain filmed with ice. The door shuts behind you with a soft **thud** you can’t fully dampen.

Immediately, the tapping at the fan grille changes location—sliding along the metal, left to right—tracking your entry. A second later, something **scrapes** along the outside of the compartment wall, not at the door but above it, as if it’s climbing to find an access seam.

The engineer crouches by instinct, hands over his mouth, and mouths: *“It’s here.”* No sound. His eyes keep flicking to you like he wants permission to run.

Then the fan grille bows inward a few millimeters—just a flex—followed by a careful, probing pressure at one corner. Something is testing whether it can peel it back quietly.

You are inside the bypass compartment with the door closed. The threat is at the fan grille and moving along the compartment’s outer seams, looking for a quiet way in.

#### Turn 186 **[PLAYER]**

I grab the engineer’s sleeve and pull him close until his forehead nearly touches my shoulder, then mouth, *“Eyes on me. Breathe with me.”*  

I crouch to the iced floor drain and scrape a shard of ice free with my nail, then flick it hard across the compartment to clatter against the far ducting—one sharp, deliberate decoy—while my other hand feels along the console and wall for a manual access latch or service panel.  

Without speaking, I point the engineer to the lowest space behind the waist-high ducting and press him down into cover, then press my ear to the door seam, listening for whether the thing shifts toward the ice-sound or keeps worrying the fan grille.

*Agent reasoning: It’s hunting by sound and seams; if we can’t outrun it, we have to misdirect it. The fan and drain give me noise and a path—cold air, water, vibration—to bait it away while we slip out another route. I need the engineer calm and obedient, and I refuse to let it “sing” him into answering.*

#### Turn 187 **[GAME]**

You pull the engineer in until his brow nearly touches your shoulder. He locks on to you like a drowning man finding a rope. He matches your inhale—ragged at first—then steadies, small, nasal, quiet. He nods once when you mouth *Eyes on me.*

You crouch to the floor drain. The ice film there is thick and cloudy; your nail worries at it until a shard breaks free with a brittle crack you feel in your fingertips. You flick it hard.

It skips once and **clatters** against the far ducting—sharp, bright, unmistakable in the tight compartment.

At the same moment your free hand searches the dead console and the wall seam. You find: a recessed **manual release ring** (painted yellow, half-scraped), and beside it a **service panel** held by two quarter-turn fasteners—both already slightly loosened, like someone opened it recently and didn’t fully reseat it.

The engineer drops where you point, folding himself behind the waist-high ducting. He presses his face to his forearm to smother any sound, eyes still on you.

You put your ear to the door seam.

Outside, the response is immediate—but not the one you wanted.

The pressure at the fan grille stops for half a second, then you hear a rapid, precise **skitter**—not toward the decoy clatter, but **away** from it, up and along the compartment’s outer skin. It’s as if the ice sound confirmed your location rather than distracted it.

Then a new sound: the faint, careful **turn** of metal on metal above the doorframe—someone working a latch or fastener from the other side, very gently, trying not to make the hinge creak again.

A thin line of colder air threads through the top seam of the door, carrying a smell like dry wax and ozone.

The threat is repositioning to enter from **above the door**, likely through an overhead access seam or panel, and it’s doing it quietly and fast. You have a manual release ring and a barely-secured service panel within arm’s reach.

#### Turn 188 **[PLAYER]**

I flash two fingers at the engineer—*stay*—then I twist the quarter-turn fasteners and ease the service panel off without letting it clang, beckoning him up into the opening first. As he climbs, I hook the yellow manual release ring with two fingers, holding it taut and ready; I listen for the latch above the door to give, and if it does, I yank the ring hard to dump whatever it releases between us and the entry.

*Agent reasoning: It’s trying to come in from above the door; I need an exit that doesn’t force us past the grille. The loosened service panel is our fastest crawlspace, and the manual release ring can be a last-ditch trap/noisemaker if it breaches.*

#### Turn 189 **[GAME]**

You twist the quarter-turn fasteners with slow, controlled pressure. They give with a muted **chit-chit** as the cams rotate. You keep a palm against the panel’s face and ease it free a millimeter at a time until it lifts away without ringing against the frame.

Behind it is a tight service void—dark, smelling of stale incense and cold metal—with a ladder-run of stamped footholds. Not a full crawlspace, but enough to get a body up and out of the compartment.

You beckon the engineer. He hesitates only long enough to look at the door seam, then climbs—hands shaking, boots searching for purchase. His heel scuffs once against the panel frame, a soft **tink** you can’t stop.

Above the doorframe, the careful metal turn you’d been hearing becomes a decisive **click**—a latch finally finding its release. The top seam of the door shifts outward a hair.

You yank the yellow manual release ring.

For an instant, nothing—then the compartment answers with violence: a bypass damper snaps open somewhere in the ductwork and the service fan surges, dumping a **hard, freezing blast** of return air into the room. It’s not smoke or foam—it's pressure and cold. Loose frost and dust explode off surfaces in a white sheet, slashing across the doorway and up toward the ceiling seam like a thrown curtain.

The thing above the door reacts: you hear a sharp, involuntary **scrape** as it loses purchase, followed by a rapid series of impacts—**tap-tap-THUNK**—as it’s slammed against the outer plating and driven sideways along the corridor skin by the sudden airflow.

But the blast hits you too. Your eyes water instantly; your breath stutters as the cold bites your throat. The door, already unseated at the top, is forced wider by the pressure differential—opening a wedge at the upper corner.

Through that widening gap, you see something pale and jointed flash past—too fast to count limbs—then a hooked shape catches the top edge for a fraction of a second before the airflow tears it away again.

The engineer, halfway into the service void, panics at the roar. He scrambles upward, faster now, nearly kicking your shoulder as he goes. He doesn’t speak—just makes a strangled, silent gasp.

The immediate outcome: your release bought you a moment by physically driving the intruder off the door seam, but it also forced the door partially open at the top and filled the compartment with a loud, obvious surge that will carry down the corridor. Whatever is out there is not gone—just displaced, and now it knows exactly where you are.

#### Turn 190 **[PLAYER]**

I suck in a painful breath through my sleeve, then hiss a silent, urgent “Up—keep going,” shoving the engineer’s boot to the next foothold. I haul myself into the service void after him and, once my shoulders clear, reach back to pull the service panel up into place as a makeshift shield, bracing it with my forearm and knee while I listen for that skittering to circle back toward the opening.

*Agent reasoning: The door’s compromised and the noise will draw it back; the only safety is up in the service void. I need the engineer moving and then seal the panel behind us as quietly as I can, even if it’s sloppy.*

#### Turn 191 **[GAME]**

Your breath through your sleeve comes in sharp and thin; it burns like inhaling winter metal. You shove the engineer’s boot up to the next stamped foothold. He obeys—clumsy but fast—scrambling higher into the void until his knees and hips disappear into the dark above, leaving only his boots and one trembling hand for a moment.

You haul yourself up after him. The edge of the opening bites your ribs as you lever your shoulders through. Your palms slip on condensation; you catch yourself on a seam and drag the rest of your weight into the service void.

As soon as you’re in, you reach back down and pull the service panel up like a shield. It’s heavier than it looked—thin alloy with a stiffening rib—cold enough to stick to your skin. You brace it with forearm and knee, angling it to cover the opening.

Below, the compartment is still full of swirling frost-dust, but the pressure surge is already decaying. The wedge of the door’s top corner remains slightly open; you can hear the corridor “breathing” through it.

You listen.

At first: nothing but the settling fan whine and the engineer’s muffled, frantic breathing above you.

Then the skitter returns—distinct now that you’re in the void and the sound transmits through the ship’s bones. It’s not coming straight back to the panel opening. It circles along the corridor plating outside, fast and low, like it’s testing for another route.

A second sound joins it: a soft, deliberate **knock** from directly on the other side of your makeshift shield—one contact, then another, as if something is tapping the panel to learn what it is.

The engineer freezes above you. You feel his body go rigid through the ladder-run; a tiny tremor travels down the metal.

The tapping stops.

In its place, a thin, careful **scrape** begins at the bottom edge of the opening—something trying to get purchase under the panel you’re bracing. The force is exploratory, not brute, but it’s steady and getting smarter: levering, pausing, levering again, feeling for the angle of your knee and the weak point of your grip.

You are concealed in the service void with the engineer above you. The intruder is at the opening, actively trying to pry your shielded panel away.

#### Turn 192 **[PLAYER]**

I press my mouth to the seam above the panel and breathe a soft, broken phrase of the cathedral-psalm into the crack—just enough to carry, not enough to echo—then I shift my knee suddenly to *invite* the pry and snap the panel downward a handspan like a jaw.  

Without looking up, I reach back and pinch the engineer’s ankle hard—*move*—mouthing, “Up. Find an out.”  

As soon as the panel drops, I shove it back into place and start climbing after him, listening for the skitter to recoil or surge into the opening.

*Agent reasoning: I can’t outmuscle something patient and jointed; I need to redirect it and buy seconds. The void likely has another exit—if I can get the engineer moving while I use sound and the ship’s own hymn-whispers to unsettle it, we might slip away.*

#### Turn 193 **[GAME]**

Your lips find the seam above the panel. You exhale the broken psalm-phrase—barely voiced, more breath than sound.

The metal answers anyway.

Not with words—with a change in the ship’s behavior: the void around you tightens cold, and the panel under your forearm vibrates as if something on the other side paused to *listen*. The scraping stops mid-stroke.

Then you shift your knee and *invite* the pry.

Whatever is under the edge takes it. The pressure rises—careful, confident—like a hooked tool levering up.

You snap the panel down a handspan.

It **bites**.

A wet, brittle crack pops through the seam, followed by a thin, high squeal that is not mechanical. Something pale withdraws so fast it rasps along the opening edge, leaving a smear like frost mixed with diluted blood across the panel’s underside.

Immediately, the skittering surges—not retreating. It moves from “searching” to “committing,” racing up the corridor skin toward your opening with a frantic, angry rhythm.

You pinch the engineer’s ankle hard. He jerks, almost loses a foothold, then scrambles upward on instinct. He doesn’t answer, but he *moves*, boots hammering the stamped holds.

You shove the panel back into place.

A heartbeat later, something slams into it from below—hard enough to jolt your knee and numb your forearm. The panel holds, but the edge lifts a fraction, and a hooked, jointed tip snakes into the gap, feeling blind.

You start climbing.

Behind you, the hook rakes at the opening, trying to widen it. You hear metal being scored—short, repeated **chirps** as it catches and slips. The panel is buying you seconds, not safety.

As you climb, a new sound threads through the service void: a soft, human exhale from somewhere that isn’t the engineer—close, just out of sight above the ladder-run. And then a quiet voice, controlled and clinical, speaking downward into the darkness:

“Elara. Don’t feed it unsanctioned syllables.”

A face is not visible yet, but you catch the glint of a Warden’s lens and the faint scent of antiseptic incense drifting down from above—someone is waiting at the top of this run while the thing below tries to force its way in.

#### Turn 194 **[PLAYER]**

I keep climbing, one rung at a time, eyes on the dark above. “Sable—then give me sanctioned words, or give me silence. Either way, open the hatch and get him out.”  

I glance down once at the gap and the probing hook, then call up more softly, “How many seconds before it learns the panel?” and shove the engineer’s boot again—up, up—toward her.

*Agent reasoning: Sable’s voice is both a lifeline and a threat—Wardens don’t “help” without taking something. I need her to secure the top while I get the engineer out, but I won’t let her control my tongue; I’ll bargain and keep moving before the thing pries in.*

#### Turn 195 **[GAME]**

You climb, rung by rung, keeping your head angled up into the cramped dark. The engineer’s boots clatter above you; you shove one heel to the next foothold and he lurches higher, breath rasping.

Sable doesn’t answer immediately. You hear her shift position at the top—fabric whisper, a tool tapping metal. A narrow cone of light cuts down the ladder-run for a second, then snaps off again like she’s refusing to give the thing below a target.

“Sanctioned words,” she says at last, voice tight. “Breathe. Count. Don’t *sing* to it.”

Metal grinds above you: a wheel-lock being turned, not fully—just enough to test. Then she stops.

“I can’t open the hatch yet,” she adds, lower. “There’s a seal-mark on the outside. Synod wax. If I break it, the corridor reroutes and I lose you both.”

Below, the panel gives a short, ugly **snap**—a fastener finally shearing. The probing hook doesn’t just feel now; it *pulls*. The gap widens by a finger’s width, and you see a pale, jointed segment press into the opening, braced like a forearm.

Your question about seconds answers itself: it’s learning *as you speak*.

Sable’s light flickers on—one controlled blink—just long enough for you to see her silhouette crouched at the top of the run, one hand on the hatch wheel, the other holding a compact injector and a coil of filament line.

“Thirty,” she says. “Maybe less.”

She reaches down and loops the filament around the engineer’s wrist as he comes within arm’s length, yanking him the last half-meter upward with a sharp, efficient pull. He scrapes his shoulder on the sidewall and yelps into his sleeve.

At the bottom, the thing commits. The panel flexes inward, then *lifts* as the hook levers it. Cold air knifes up the ladder-run. You hear the creature’s movement change from skitter to climb—hard, rhythmic impacts on the metal like knuckles on rungs.

Sable braces at the hatch, still not opening it, and snaps, “Elara—faster. If it gets into the run, it doesn’t need the panel.”

The threat is now climbing toward you inside the same ladder-run, using the opening as an entry point.

#### Turn 196 **[PLAYER]**

I bare my teeth up into the dark. “Sable—break the Synod wax. Reroute it. I’d rather be lost than opened.”

I hook my boot under a rung and kick downward hard, then rip my sleeve and wrap it around my forearm as I reach down to jam cloth into the lower rungs—anything to snag joints and slow its grip—before I scramble up after the engineer, breathing, counting under my breath like she ordered.

*Agent reasoning: I can’t outrun it cleanly in a narrow ladder-run; I need Sable to risk the wax seal while I buy seconds by fouling the creature’s climb, even if it costs me skin.*

#### Turn 198 **[PLAYER]**

I snarl up the ladder-run, “Sable—break the Synod wax. Reroute it. I’d rather be lost than opened.”

I hook my boot under a rung and kick downward hard, then tear my sleeve and twist the cloth around my forearm as I reach down to jam it between the lower rungs—anything to snag joints and slow its grip—before I scramble up after the engineer, breathing through my teeth and counting under my breath, “One. Two. Three.”

*Agent reasoning: Sable’s hesitation will get us killed; Elara would choose sacrilege over being taken. She’ll try to slow the climber with improvised snares while forcing herself into Sable’s “sanctioned” counting to keep the psalms from spilling out.*

#### Turn 199 **[GAME]**

#### Turn 200 **[PLAYER]**

I snarl up the ladder-run, “Sable—break the Synod wax. Reroute it. I’d rather be lost than opened.”

I hook my boot under a rung and kick downward hard, then tear my sleeve and twist the cloth around my forearm as I jam it between the lower rungs to snag whatever’s climbing. I scramble up after the engineer, breathing through my teeth and counting, “One. Two. Three.”

*Agent reasoning: Sable’s hesitation will get us killed; I’m panicking but still thinking like a clinician—slow the climber, force a reroute, accept being “lost” over being breached.*

#### Turn 201 **[GAME]**

Sable hesitates for one breath—then you hear her thumb a striker. Wax doesn’t *crack* so much as give up with a soft, obscene peel.

“Forgive me,” she says, not to you.

A sharp, sweet-smelling heat blooms at the top of the ladder-run as she drags the flame across the Synod seal. The wax liquefies and runs in thin threads down the hatch rim. The moment the last bridge of wax breaks, the ship answers: somewhere close, a door slams with cathedral-finality, and the ladder-run’s air pressure shifts—your ears pop hard.

The corridor above doesn’t open. It *moves*. Metal under Sable’s boots groans, and the hatch wheel judders in her hand like it’s suddenly connected to something alive and deciding.

Your kick lands. You feel the rung shudder through your boot, and you hear a wet, jointed impact below—something strikes the rung from the other side. It doesn’t yelp. It *repositions*. Then your torn sleeve goes down between rungs, wadded tight.

For two seconds it works: you feel the cloth catch, tugging as the climber’s grip snags. The ladder-run fills with a thin, high clicking—rapid, irritated, like teeth on glass. Then the cloth goes slack. Not pulled free—*cut*. A clean slice, as if the thing has a blade hidden where a finger should be.

A pale segment flashes in the dark below, then another. It’s climbing fast now, ignoring the rungs and using the sidewalls—four points of contact, insect-efficient.

Sable yanks the engineer up and away from the hatch lip and snaps the wheel hard anyway. The hatch finally gives—but not into the corridor you expected. It opens onto a narrow, triangular service throat washed in cold blue light, with no incense in it at all. You smell raw metal and old coolant.

“Wrong side,” Sable spits. “Synod reroute—now!”

She grabs your wrist and hauls you the last rungs. As you crest the hatch, you glimpse the ladder-run below: the thing is halfway up, a long, jointed body with a humanlike forearm shape that ends in a split, shearing tip. It launches upward in a single, violent surge—

—and the hatch begins to swing back on its own, closing like a jaw.

If you don’t clear the opening immediately, you’ll be caught in the closing hatch with the climber a few meters beneath you.

#### Turn 202 **[PLAYER]**

I throw myself forward into the blue-lit throat, then twist back long enough to slam my boot into the hatch edge and shove it shut harder—anything to make it bite closed on empty air instead of my ribs. “Sable—pull him deeper, now!” I rasp, then scramble after them, counting through clenched teeth, “Four. Five. Six.”

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is closing like a trap and the climber is surging; I need to clear the opening now, but I also want to buy Sable and the engineer time by making myself the last through and obstructing the jaw.*

#### Turn 203 **[GAME]**

You hit the blue-lit service throat shoulder-first and slide on cold metal, palms scraping across a film of condensation. Behind you, the hatch is already swinging—fast.

You twist and drive your boot into the hatch edge.

It bites shut with a clang that punches through your shin. The wheel-lock jerks once as if something on the other side rams it—then the seal catches. A thin seam of frost instantly webs across the hatch rim, locking metal to metal with a brittle, crackling sound.

For half a second, silence.

Then: *thunk… thunk… thunk*—measured impacts from the ladder-run side, not frantic. Testing. Feeling for give.

Sable doesn’t argue. She’s already got the Concord engineer by the collar and the belt harness, dragging him deeper into the triangular throat. He stumbles, boots skidding, and you hear his breath go ragged in the unincensed air.

“I can’t—my mask—” he starts.

“Breathe anyway,” Sable snaps, and shoves him forward. “Move.”

The blue light comes from a strip of exposed conduit running along the ceiling like a vein. It flickers as you pass under it, and each flicker leaves a faint afterimage of your hands on the walls—like the ship is remembering where you touched.

You scramble after them, counting “Four. Five. Six,” and the numbers come out too loud in the dead air.

Behind you, the impacts stop.

A new sound replaces them: a slow, dry scraping around the hatch seam, like a blade being drawn in a circle. Frost dust sifts from the rim in tiny bursts, drifting into the throat.

Sable glances back once, sees the frost crawling, and her face tightens. “It’s not trying to break in,” she says, voice low. “It’s trying to learn the latch.”

Ahead, the throat narrows and kinks left—past the bend, the blue light dies into darkness. The engineer is already half-limp with fear and thin air, but Sable keeps hauling him, forcing motion.

The hatch behind you holds—for now—but whatever is on the other side has stopped hitting it and started *working* on it.

#### Turn 204 **[PLAYER]**

I grab the engineer’s wrist as we hit the bend, press two fingers hard to his pulse, and hiss, “Stay with me—match my count. Seven. Eight.” Then I glance back toward the hatch seam and whisper, almost a prayer, “Don’t teach it. Don’t teach it,” before tearing another strip of fabric and smearing it along the wall-conduit as we turn—marking our path in case the ship shifts again.

*Agent reasoning: The thing is learning the latch; we can’t afford a straight flight. I need to slow it with something it can’t “understand,” and keep the engineer conscious while Sable leads us through the rerouted guts.*

#### Turn 205 **[GAME]**

Your fingers find the engineer’s pulse—fast, thready, but present. His wrist is cold-sweat slick in your grip.

“Seven,” you hiss.

He tries to answer and only gets a rasp. His eyes lock on yours in the blue spill, wide and wet. Sable shoves his shoulder to keep him moving, but she lets you set the rhythm.

“Eight,” you insist.

This time he manages it: “E—eight.” The sound is ugly, but it’s speech. He’s still with you.

At the bend you glance back. The hatch seam is no longer just frosted; the frost has been *scored*, a thin ring carved around the wheel-lock like someone traced the mechanism by feel. A faint metallic squeal carries down the throat—deliberate, patient.

You whisper, “Don’t teach it. Don’t teach it,” and the words fog in the unincensed air, then vanish.

You tear another strip of fabric. The rip is loud in the narrow space. You smear it along the wall-conduit as you turn the kink—leaving a pale streak against the blue-lit vein.

The conduit reacts.

Not a spark—worse: the blue light flutters and *syncs* to your movement, pulsing twice in quick succession like a heartbeat answering your count. The fabric doesn’t just mark; it *wets* with condensation and clings, and where it touches the conduit’s casing, a faint line of warmer light threads under the metal as if your smear completed a circuit.

Sable’s head snaps toward the strip. “Elara—don’t—” she starts, but she’s too late. The throat ahead answers with a soft chime, and somewhere deeper in the dark, a relay clicks open.

The air changes: a thin wash of incense-less cold flows from ahead, carrying the smell of old coolant and something like burnt copper—your tongue tastes it immediately.

Behind you, at the hatch, the scraping stops.

A single *click* echoes through the throat, as if the thing on the other side just found the point that matters.

Sable grips the engineer harder and pulls him around the bend into the darkness. “Move,” she says, no longer snapping—now it’s urgent and flat. “Whatever you just did, you told the ship where we are.”

#### Turn 206 **[PLAYER]**

“I know—my fault.” I snatch the smeared strip back off the conduit with shaking fingers, wad it tight in my fist, and keep the engineer moving by his wrist. “Nine. Ten—say it.”

I lean close to Sable as we push into the dark. “Where does this throat *actually* go—coolant bay, confessionals, anywhere we can seal? And what does the Synod wax reroute *wake up* when you break it?”

*Agent reasoning: I feel guilty for triggering the conduit and I’m terrified the ship is “tracking” us; I’ll try to undo my mistake, keep the engineer conscious with the count, and press Sable for a plan without losing momentum.*

#### Turn 207 **[GAME]**

You peel the smeared strip off the conduit. It comes away with a thin, stubborn tack—like lifting a bandage. The blue vein-light stutters once, then steadies, but the warmer thread you “completed” doesn’t vanish immediately; it fades slowly under the casing, retreating deeper into the throat as if the ship is reluctantly letting go of a scent.

You wad the strip tight in your fist. The engineer’s wrist jerks when you tug him onward.

“Nine,” you say.

He swallows hard. “N-nine.”

“Ten.”

“Ten.” He gets it out, then coughs—dry, painful. No incense means no cushion; every breath is raw metal.

Sable leans in as you push into the darkness beyond the bend. Her hand finds the wall by habit, fingers skimming for seam-lines.

“Where does it go?” you ask.

She answers while moving, voice low so it won’t carry. “Service distribution. Return-air and coolant bypass share the same bones in this section. If we’re lucky, it drops into a maintenance case bay—there are manual shutters. If we’re not…” She exhales through her teeth. “It opens into a confessionary junction. Those don’t seal. They *listen*.”

“And the wax reroute?”

Sable’s jaw tightens. “Synod wax isn’t just ‘do not enter.’ It’s a bargain. A memory paid to the ship so the corridor behaves—so doors pick *their* people and keep out the rest.” She glances back into the black behind you, as if expecting the dark to have learned your outline. “When you break it, you cancel the bargain. The ship stops honoring the Synod’s routing… and something older takes over. The warding becomes a hunt.”

Ahead, a faint blue glow returns—not from a striplight, but from a small rectangular service plaque set into the wall. As you pass, the plaque wakes and displays a single line of text in Concord maintenance glyphs:

**RETURN AIR / BYPASS — MANUAL SHUTTERS (2)**

Then, beneath it, a second line scrolls in a different, stuttering font—one you’ve only seen in Elara’s translation margins:

**LOVERS AS ORGANS**

Behind you, far back at the hatch line, metal gives a soft, satisfied sound: not a bang—an *unlatch*. The wheel-lock you froze is being undone from the other side, one learned motion at a time.

#### Turn 208 **[PLAYER]**

I force my eyes off the scrolling phrase and squeeze the engineer’s wrist. “Eleven. Twelve—say it. Don’t let it steal your breath.”  
To Sable, I murmur, “Find shutters—now. I’ll take the wheel if there is one.” As we move, I spit the wadded cloth strip into my palm and scrub it hard over the alien line on the plaque, smearing it blind as we pass.

*Agent reasoning: The plaque’s “LOVERS AS ORGANS” feels like the ship baiting my grief; I need to keep the engineer conscious and get us behind something that can actually seal—manual shutters—before the latch gives.*

#### Turn 209 **[GAME]**

“Eleven,” you say, crushing his wrist just enough to keep him present.

“E-’leven,” he rasps, eyes squeezed shut.

“Twelve.”

“Twelve.” He gets it out, then his knees dip. Sable catches his harness strap and hauls him forward before he can fold.

You murmur to her, “Find shutters—now. I’ll take the wheel if there is one.”

Sable nods once and breaks ahead by half a step, palm sweeping the wall, searching for the physical—handles, seams, anything that isn’t hymnwork.

You spit into your palm, mash the wadded cloth against the plaque, and scrub hard over the alien line.

It smears—partially. The Concord glyphs haze under wet grime. The alien text doesn’t wipe like ink. It *fights* the motion: the characters stutter, then re-form a half-inch higher, as if the plaque is sliding the message away from your hand. Your scrubbing does, however, leave a greasy blind spot that interrupts the scroll.

For a heartbeat, the plaque goes dim.

Then it flares brighter—blue-white—and emits a short, sharp maintenance chirp that’s loud in the unincensed throat. Not an alarm siren, but unmistakably a “service attention” ping.

Sable swears under her breath. “You just woke the panel.”

A seam to the right of the plaque pops with a pressure equalization tick, and a narrow access door unlatches by a finger-width—enough to show darkness beyond and a glint of a handwheel inside.

At the same time, the air shifts behind you: a thin, cold draft pulls toward the direction of the hatch you came from, like the throat is inhaling.

From far back, metal speaks again—closer now. The learned unlatching isn’t finished, but whatever is working the wheel-lock has progressed. You hear the telltale *ratchet* of a mechanism being turned carefully, not forced.

The threat is clear: something intelligent is opening the hatch you sealed, and your scrubbing has just pinged a maintenance node—broadcasting your position down the service line.

Sable drags the engineer toward the cracked access door and barks, “Wheel. Now, Elara—either seal us in or seal *it* out.”

Morning, Saltmarrow Cemetery’s upper tier—Lantern Row—where the path narrows between leaning slate and a low iron fence furred with salt. Sea-mist beads on carved names until they look freshly inked. The lanterns are still lit from last night, and each flame sputters an unhealthy blue that makes the gravel look cold.

You kneel beside the Harrowell marker, apron tied, hair pinned back the way you learned above Ashford & Daughters. A soft brush clears lichen from a serifed “E,” and your small tools click in your pocket when you shift your weight. You test the stone with a fingertip, careful as if it were skin, then set a stencil to match the original cut. Patience is part of the job; so is noticing what other people hope you won’t.

The date is wrong.

Yesterday the stone read *1889*. Today it reads *1883*, the new “3” cut too clean to be weather. At the base, fresh grit still sits in the chisel line. You lean closer and find a second problem: the border stones around the Harrowell plot have been nudged inward, just enough that the corner now bites into the neighboring family’s ground. That kind of shift takes time, leverage, and permission—unless someone is doing it before dawn.

Footsteps crunch behind you. When you turn, a man stands just inside the gate, coat damp at the shoulders, dark hair still threaded with mist. He doesn’t carry a tour pamphlet or a wreath. He holds a folded sheet of vellum in one hand and keeps the other near his pocket like he’s used to trouble. “Elowen Ashford,” he says, not asking. He opens the vellum just enough for you to see a maintenance overlay of the cemetery—ghost paths, sealed sections—and three plot coordinates inked in your mother’s looping shorthand.

“I bought this from someone who shouldn’t have it,” he says. “Your name was the only instruction.”

The blue lantern above you gutters hard, as if reacting.

You have a freshly altered grave at your knees, an impossible map in a stranger’s hand, and a town heading toward the Brine-Choir’s vigil tonight. He waits for an answer, and the cemetery stays very still.

#### Turn 10 **[PLAYER]**

I rise slowly, wiping my fingers on my apron, and step just close enough to see the ink clearly. “That *is* my mother’s hand,” I say, voice careful. “Who sold it to you—and why were they carrying cemetery overlays in the first place?”

*Agent reasoning: This is my mother’s handwriting—panic and hope in equal measure—so I need to see the vellum up close, but I don’t trust him yet; I’ll keep things polite and controlled while clocking the altered headstone as another immediate threat.*

#### Turn 11 **[GAME]**

You step in, close enough that the vellum’s surface catches the lanternlight. The ink is old-black, not the newer soot-brown the Society uses—your mother’s habit of tightening the downstrokes is there, unmistakable. The stranger doesn’t pull it away, but his grip firms at the corners.

He answers your questions in the wrong order.

“Because the cemetery is being run like a ledger,” he says, low. “And ledgers have overlays.”

Then: “A lantern-lighter sold it to me. Not one of the public-facing guides—one of the ones who carries keys.” His eyes flick past your shoulder, toward the path behind you, as if expecting someone to be listening. “He didn’t give a name. He had a thumb missing to the first knuckle and smelled like lamp-oil and brine. He said the map was ‘hot’ and that if I wanted the rest of it, I should find you before the Choir started singing tonight.”

As he speaks, a faint click comes from the iron fence to your left—metal on metal, like a latch being tested. You look: nothing obvious moves, but the chain on the side gate is hanging differently than you remember, the padlock turned outward instead of inward.

The blue lantern above you sputters again. In that brief stutter, you catch it: a second set of footprints in the damp gravel off the main path—too narrow for the caretaker’s boots you know, toes pointed toward you and the stranger, then scuffed as if someone backed away into the grass.

The man folds the vellum once, not hiding it fully but making it easier to snatch. “If you want to ask me what I’m doing in Saltmarrow,” he adds, “do it somewhere that isn’t lit like a signal.”

Another sound—soft, deliberate—comes from the row of headstones behind the Harrowell plot: the scrape of grit under a shoe sole. Whoever it is, they’re close enough now that they’re choosing to be heard.

#### Turn 12 **[PLAYER]**

I catch his sleeve and tug him toward the Harrowell mausoleum’s shadow, keeping my voice even. “Fold it—now. And stay close.” Then, louder, I call into the stones behind us: “Cemetery’s closed. If you’ve got business, say it plainly—before I start shouting for the caretaker.”

*Agent reasoning: Someone’s shadowing us, and I won’t let a stranger—or my mother’s map—get snatched. I need to move us out of the lanternlight and force the watcher to show themselves.*

#### Turn 13 **[GAME]**

Your fingers close on his sleeve—wool damp and cold—and you pull him into the Harrowell mausoleum’s lee. The stone there holds the night’s chill; the blue lanternlight doesn’t reach cleanly, and the mist seems to hesitate at the carved angels over the door.

He obeys immediately. The vellum folds in practiced, quick creases and disappears into the inner pocket of his coat. He shifts so his body blocks the mausoleum door seam, eyes fixed on the row of headstones you called out to.

Your voice carries. “Cemetery’s closed…”

For a beat, nothing answers—only the buoy-bell’s distant moan and the lantern’s wet sputter.

Then someone steps into view between two slates: a Lanternward man in a dark oilskin, lantern-hook belt at his waist. His left hand is wrapped in stained cloth, thumb stump blunt beneath it. He holds a long-handled lantern snuffer like a walking stick, and his face is drawn tight with sleeplessness.

He stops where the path widens, keeping a respectful distance that still feels like a boundary. “No need to shout, Miss Ashford,” he says, voice mild and rehearsed. “Caretaker sent me to check the blue lamps. Folks have been… fretting.”

Behind him, a second figure doesn’t step out—only a suggestion of movement in the grass line to his right, where the mist thickens. You hear a quiet exhale and the faint clink of something metal being adjusted, like a buckle or a keyring.

The Lanternward man’s gaze flicks to the Harrowell stone at your knees—wrong date, nudged borders—and then to the stranger’s coat pocket, too quickly to be accidental. “You’ve got company,” he notes, as if it’s casual. “Not a tour day.”

The stranger beside you goes still. His hand stays visible, empty, but his posture changes—ready.

The Lanternward man lifts his snuffer a few inches, not threatening exactly, but making it clear he can close lanterns—make dark—fast. “If you’ve found something you shouldn’t,” he says, softer now, “best you hand it over. The Society doesn’t like… misunderstandings. Especially before a vigil.”

He doesn’t advance. He waits, and the hidden presence in the grass waits with him.

#### Turn 14 **[PLAYER]**

I let my shoulders soften into a tired little sigh, like he’s interrupted nothing more dangerous than moss removal. “The caretaker didn’t mention you—what’s your name?” I ask, then take a small step sideways so my back is to the mausoleum and my eyes can keep the grass line in view. “And if the Society wants something from me, they can ask me in daylight, in the office, with proper records—so unless you’re here to explain why the Harrowell date changed overnight, you can put that snuffer down.”

*Agent reasoning: Lanternward with keys means he’s the seller—and he’s not alone. I’m not giving up my mother’s map, but I can buy time by playing polite and harmless while edging us toward a safer, more public path.*

#### Turn 15 **[GAME]**

Your tired sigh lands the way you intend: ordinary, put-upon. You shift sideways until your shoulder touches the mausoleum’s cold stone, giving you a clean angle on the grass line.

The Lanternward man’s expression tightens at the question. For a moment he looks like he might ignore it—then he answers, as if forced by habit into politeness.

“Pell,” he says. “Jory Pell.”

He does not lower the snuffer. Instead, he plants its ferrule on the gravel and leans on it, casual as a cane. “Daylight, office, proper records,” he repeats, tasting the words. “That’s the trouble with you Ashfords. You think paper keeps you safe.”

At the mention of the Harrowell date, his eyes cut to the stone again. He doesn’t deny it changed. That silence is its own admission.

From the grass line to Pell’s right, the hidden figure finally commits: a woman steps half out of the mist, not Lanternward-uniformed—plain dark dress, hair pinned tight, a ring of keys on a chain at her waist. She doesn’t look at you first; she looks at the stranger, then at Pell, and gives the smallest nod, like confirming a description.

Pell speaks again, voice still mild, but the edges are sharper. “You can keep your voice down and we can all walk away tidy. Or you can shout for a caretaker who isn’t on this tier, and my friend here—Mara—will make sure your shouting doesn’t carry.”

Mara’s hand comes up. Not a weapon—an oiled cloth and a small glass bottle. The smell hits even from a few paces: sharp, sweet, medicinal. Ether or something like it.

The threat is clear now: they’re not here to argue policy. They’re here to take the map and, if necessary, quiet you.

Pell shifts his weight forward one step, closing distance. “Last chance,” he says, eyes on the stranger’s coat pocket. “Hand it over.”

The blue lantern above you gutters hard, and for a second the path is darker—enough for Mara to angle her body as if preparing to rush from the grass.

#### Turn 16 **[PLAYER]**

I lift my hands slowly, palms out. “All right—easy,” I say, then glance up at the sputtering blue lantern. “If you’re Lanternward, prove it: snuff that one. It’s spooking the whole tier.”  
As Pell’s attention flicks upward, I hook my foot behind the Harrowell border stone and kick gravel hard into the path between us, then grab the stranger’s sleeve again and hiss, “Run—down Lantern Row, don’t look back,” and I shout at the top of my lungs, “CARETAKER—UPPER TIER! HELP!”

*Agent reasoning: They’re here to drug me and take the vellum; I need distance, noise, and to keep the map out of their hands. I’ll create a distraction with the lantern/snuffer and use my voice to draw attention while we move.*

#### Turn 17 **[GAME]**

Pell’s eyes do flick up at the blue lantern—just a reflex, the way anyone who lives by flame can’t help but check a gutter.

He does not snuff it.

But that half-beat is enough.

Your foot hooks the Harrowell border stone and you kick. Gravel sprays across the path in a harsh hiss, pelting Pell’s oilskin and skittering under his boots. His next step slips; he catches himself with the snuffer’s ferrule, metal scraping stone.

You seize the stranger’s sleeve and shove him into motion. He doesn’t argue—he bolts, coat tails snapping, heading down Lantern Row exactly as you ordered.

Mara moves immediately. She lunges after him, keys clinking, bottle and cloth up like she’s done this before. Pell barks, “Not the girl—get the map!” and surges forward toward you instead, trying to cut you off from following.

You shout—full-throated, tearing sound that bounces off slate and marble: “CARETAKER—UPPER TIER! HELP!”

The tier answers with movement, not a voice. From farther downslope, a lantern flares brighter—someone has heard, or at least seen the commotion. But it’s not close.

Pell closes the distance fast. He swings the snuffer not at your head, but low, aiming to hook your ankle or knock your legs out from under you. You jerk back against the mausoleum stone; the snuffer’s rim clips your shin with a hard, numbing smack.

Pain blossoms hot and immediate. Your leg holds, but it stings and your balance wobbles.

Mara is already several strides after the stranger—then she hesitates as your shout carries. She glances back once, calculating, and hisses something to Pell you don’t catch.

Pell’s face changes—less polite, more urgent. “You’ve made it messy,” he snaps, and reaches with his free hand for your wrist, trying to pin you to the mausoleum wall and keep you from giving chase or screaming again.

Down Lantern Row, the stranger is a dark shape running through blue-guttering pools of light—Mara gaining on him in the mist, cloth raised.

**Threat, clear:** Pell is trying to restrain you physically; Mara is attempting to catch the stranger and use the drugged cloth on him to take the map.

#### Turn 18 **[PLAYER]**

I drive my elbow back into Pell’s ribs and twist my wrist hard, then snatch the stiff edge of my apron up over my nose and mouth as I scream again, “HELP—LANTERN ROW!”  
Stumbling on my sore shin, I grab my water tin and fling it down the path toward Mara, shouting, “HEY—MARA! PUT IT DOWN!”

*Agent reasoning: Wren won’t let herself be dragged off quietly—she’ll fight dirty with whatever’s at hand and keep drawing attention, while trying to stop Mara from catching the stranger.*

#### Turn 19 **[GAME]**

Your elbow drives back into Pell’s ribs with a dull, satisfying thud. He grunts—air knocked out—and his grip loosens just enough for you to wrench your wrist free. You twist hard; his fingers scrape your skin and then slip off.

You yank your apron up over your nose and mouth and scream again, louder, ragged with pain in your shin: “HELP—LANTERN ROW!”

This time you get an answer: a man’s voice, distant but real, calling, “Oi! Up there!” Footsteps start pounding uphill, still far—at least half a tier down.

Pell recovers fast. His face goes mean with embarrassment. “Shut—up,” he spits, and swings the snuffer again, higher now, aiming to clip your shoulder and drive you back into the mausoleum’s shadow. The rim catches your upper arm—hard enough to make your fingers go numb for a second, not enough to drop you.

You fumble for your water tin—small, dented, half-full—and fling it down the path toward Mara.

It sails low and fast, then bounces off a headstone base with a loud *clang* and skitters into the gravel, spraying water in a brief arc. The noise makes Mara flinch and glance back.

Your shout—“HEY—MARA! PUT IT DOWN!”—lands. Mara’s jaw tightens; she doesn’t put anything down. She changes tactics.

She stops chasing straight at the stranger and instead cuts across the grass to intercept him where Lantern Row narrows between two leaning stones. Keys flash at her waist as she moves. The cloth stays raised, bottle in her other hand.

The stranger is still running, but he’s about to hit that pinch-point in the path—Mara is positioning to step into him from the side and clamp the cloth over his face.

Behind you, Pell steps in again, closer than before. He reaches not for your wrist this time, but for the apron at your face—trying to yank it down and force you to breathe whatever Mara has. His breath smells of lamp-oil and salt.

**Immediate threats:**
- Pell is within arm’s reach and trying to control your breathing/face covering.
- Mara is about to intercept the stranger at a narrow section of Lantern Row and use the drugged cloth.

#### Turn 20 **[PLAYER]**

I clamp the apron tight with one hand and bite Pell’s reaching fingers as hard as I can, then knee him—clumsy but vicious—right where it’ll count. “DON’T TOUCH ME,” I snarl through the cloth, and I scream again, “LANTERN ROW—SHE’S GOT ETHER!”  
Then I lunge toward the path and shout after the stranger, “LEFT—OFF THE ROW, THROUGH THE YEW BREAK!”

*Agent reasoning: Pell going for my face is a line I can’t let him cross; I need to keep the apron up and make noise while buying the stranger seconds to avoid Mara’s intercept.*

#### Turn 21 **[GAME]**

You clamp the apron to your face and when Pell’s hand claws for it, you catch two of his fingers between your teeth. You bite down hard.

He yelps—high and involuntary—and jerks back, shaking his hand as blood beads along the knuckles. Before he can reset, your knee comes up.

It’s not graceful, but it lands. Pell folds with a choked noise, the snuffer clattering against the mausoleum stone. He staggers sideways, one hand cupped between his legs, the other held up and bleeding, eyes watering with rage.

“DON’T TOUCH ME,” you snarl through the cloth.

You scream again, voice tearing: “LANTERN ROW—SHE’S GOT ETHER!”

That word changes the air. Down the slope, the running footsteps you heard speed up—two sets now—and someone shouts back, “ETHER? WHO—?”

Mara hears it too. She’s at the pinch-point just as the stranger reaches it. She darts in from the side, cloth snapping up toward his face.

But your shout and your next call hit in the same instant: “LEFT—OFF THE ROW, THROUGH THE YEW BREAK!”

The stranger commits on instinct. He veers left, shoulder-checking into the yew’s dark gap instead of pushing through the narrow stones. Mara’s cloth brushes his cheek—not a full seal—and he stumbles into the branches, coughing, but he’s still moving.

Mara swears, sharp and low, and plunges after him. The yew boughs whip and scrape; her keys jangle wildly, giving away her line.

Behind you, Pell isn’t finished. He straightens with a hiss, face blotched with pain and humiliation. He snatches up the snuffer again and—rather than swing—he lunges to tackle, trying to drive you to the ground and stop you from shouting any more.

You have a heartbeat of warning: his boots scrape on gravel, shoulders dropping as he comes in.

Down Lantern Row, lanternlight flares—two figures cresting the rise, still a short run away. They’re close enough now that Pell glances toward them, calculating whether to finish this fast or flee.

**Threats now:** Pell is mid-lunge to take you down; Mara is in pursuit through the yew break, and the stranger is not yet safe—he’s being chased in close quarters where a cloth can be clamped over his face.

#### Turn 22 **[PLAYER]**

I sidestep at the last second and grab for Pell’s coat collar and snuffer arm, trying to use his momentum to sling him into the mausoleum wall, then I shout at the approaching lanterns, “JORY PELL—LANTERNWARD—HE’S GOT A SNUFFER AND SHE’S GOT ETHER!”

*Agent reasoning: Pell’s trying to take me down right as help is almost here; if I can spoil his tackle and make noise, he’ll either flee or get caught. The stranger’s in the yew with Mara—too far for me to reach safely, but I can at least keep Mara from doubling back by drawing attention and keeping Pell pinned in place.*

#### Turn 23 **[GAME]**

You sidestep as Pell lunges. Your hand snags his coat collar; your other clamps his snuffer arm at the elbow. For a moment you have him—his momentum rolling past you—and you wrench, trying to sling him into the mausoleum wall.

It half-works.

Pell’s shoulder smashes into the stone with a meaty *thunk*, and his snuffer arm bangs hard enough that the metal rings. But he’s heavier than you and already braced for a struggle; instead of being thrown cleanly, he twists with the impact, rips his collar partly free, and drags you with him. Your sore shin skates on loose gravel; pain spikes and you nearly go down.

Pell uses the tangle to his advantage—he shoves his forearm across your upper chest and tries to pin you against the mausoleum, snuffer still in his fist, held awkwardly between you. Close enough that you can smell his lamp-oil breath again.

You shout over him, voice raw: “JORY PELL—LANTERNWARD—HE’S GOT A SNUFFER AND SHE’S GOT ETHER!”

The two figures crest the rise fully into view—Lanternward, by their coats and the hooked lantern poles. One is broad-shouldered with a lantern pole in both hands; the other carries a hand-lantern and a ring of keys that clinks as he runs.

“Pell?!” the broad one barks, skidding to a stop and raising the pole like a staff. The key-bearer’s lantern swings, throwing blue light over Pell’s bloody knuckles and your apron over your face.

Pell’s eyes flick to them—panic, then a hard decision. He snaps, “She’s lying—she’s—” and tries to wrench the snuffer up between you, as if to threaten you into silence.

The broad Lanternward steps in fast and drives the lantern pole across Pell’s forearms, pinning the snuffer arm down with a sharp crack of wood on bone. Pell swears and recoils, grip faltering.

“Drop it,” the broad one orders, voice suddenly official. The key-bearer moves to your side, reaching for your shoulder—not to grab, but to pull you back from Pell and put himself between you.

Down the yew break, you hear branches thrash and Mara’s keys jangling—she’s still chasing the stranger, and now she knows help has arrived.

**Immediate threat:** Mara is still loose with ether in the yews; Pell is being restrained but not yet disarmed, and the Lanternward are about to decide who they believe.

#### Turn 24 **[PLAYER]**

I stumble back a step from Pell, keeping my apron over my nose and mouth, and point hard toward the yew break. “He’s not alone—Mara went that way with ether after a stranger. One of you, NOW—cut her off before she gets him.”  
Then I look the broad-shouldered Lanternward dead in the face. “Search Pell. Check his pockets and hands—he tried to restrain me. I’m Wren Ashford, cemetery conservation—ask your caretaker if you need a name.”

*Agent reasoning: Pell’s the immediate danger, but Mara with ether is the real ticking clock; I need the Lanternward to act fast and believe me, and I want distance so I can breathe and think.*

#### Turn 26 **[PLAYER]**

I stagger back a step, apron still clamped over my nose and mouth, and jab my finger toward the yew break. “He’s not alone—Mara went that way with ether after a stranger. One of you, now—cut her off before she gets him.”  
Then I fix the broad Lanternward with a steady look. “Search Pell. Check his pockets and his hands—he tried to restrain me. I’m Wren Ashford, cemetery conservation. Ask the caretaker if you need a name.”

*Agent reasoning: Mara’s still out there with ether and the stranger’s about to be caught; the Lanternward need clear, immediate directions, and I need to anchor my credibility fast with my name and the caretaker.*

#### Turn 27 **[GAME]**

The key-bearer Lanternward catches your elbow and pulls you two steps back from Pell, putting his own body between you and the snuffer. He keeps his lantern low; the flame inside it still sputters an unhealthy blue.

The broad-shouldered Lanternward doesn’t take his eyes off Pell. “Mara?” he repeats, like the name tastes wrong. Then, without looking away, he snaps at his partner: “Tolan—go. Cut the yew break. Don’t breathe deep if she’s got ether.”

Tolan hesitates—eyes flicking from you to Pell to the dark gap in the yews—then he breaks into a run, lantern bobbing, boots crunching hard as he angles left toward the thicket.

Pell, half-pinned by the lantern pole, tries to straighten and put on indignation. “This is—this is Ashford trouble—she’s—”

“Hands,” the broad one orders.

He shifts the lantern pole to keep Pell’s snuffer arm trapped against the mausoleum stone, then uses his free hand to wrench Pell’s other wrist up and slap it flat to the wall. Pell hisses in pain. The broad Lanternward pats Pell down briskly—coat pockets, waist, inner breast.

His fingers find something. He pulls out a small glass vial wrapped in oiled cloth. When he uncorks it a hair, a sharp, sweet-chemical smell cuts even through your apron.

Pell’s face goes tight. “That’s not—”

The broad Lanternward corks it immediately and stares at Pell like a door has closed. “Ether,” he says, flat. Then, to you, without softening: “Wren Ashford. I know the name. Don’t move from here.”

He yanks Pell’s snuffer hand open. The snuffer drops; the broad Lanternward kicks it away across the gravel where it rings against a headstone base.

From the yew break comes a sudden muffled cough—male, rough—followed by Mara’s voice, breathless and furious: “Stop—STOP—”

Tolan’s lanternlight flashes through the branches as he arrives, and you hear him shout, “Lanternward! Mara, stand down!”

The threat is still active in the yews: Mara is close enough to be heard, ether is confirmed, and the stranger is coughing—possibly exposed.

#### Turn 28 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my apron tight over my nose and mouth and call toward the yews, “Tolan—keep upwind and don’t let her get the cloth on his face!” Then I glance at the broad Lanternward, voice rough. “Let me go with you—I know the breaks in that yew line. If he’s breathing ether, get him into open air—now.”

*Agent reasoning: Mara’s still loose and someone’s coughing in the yews—if ether’s on that cloth, seconds matter. I’m shaken but I can’t stand still; I’ll keep my face covered, warn them, and try to help the stranger without charging in blindly.*

#### Turn 29 **[GAME]**

Your voice carries into the yews. Tolan’s answer comes back sharp, already moving: “Upwind—got it!”

The broad-shouldered Lanternward—close enough now that you can see the salt-whitened seams on his gloves—doesn’t immediately agree. He hooks two fingers in the front of your apron and tugs it down just enough to see your mouth and nose are covered properly, then releases it.

“You go in there and you go down,” he says, curt. “And then I’ve got two problems.”

Another cough hacks through the yew break—wet and panicked—followed by a scuffle of shoes on roots. Mara’s voice snaps, nearer than before: “Hold still—just—hold still!”

Tolan’s lantern flares in the branches as he forces his way deeper. You hear a brief, ugly struggle—fabric tearing, someone’s elbow striking wood—then Tolan yells, “Cloth! She’s got a cloth—”

The broad Lanternward makes a decision. He shoves Pell harder into the mausoleum and plants his lantern pole across Pell’s chest like a bar.

“Don’t move,” he tells Pell, low. Then, to you: “You stay where I can see you. If you know the breaks, point. Loud.”

He breaks into a run toward the yew line, lantern in hand, boots slipping once on gravel before catching. As he goes, he calls, “Tolan—drag him out! Don’t wrestle in the thicket!”

From where you stand, you can see just enough: Tolan’s lanternlight jerks, then steadies as he backs out of the yews—hauling a man by the collar and under one arm. The stranger’s knees drag; his head lolls; he’s coughing but fading between coughs, eyes half-shut. Mara is right behind them, hair loose, one hand clutching a rag-dark cloth, the other reaching for the stranger’s shoulder like she can still reclaim him.

The broad Lanternward meets them at the edge and barks, “Mara—hands up. Now.”

Mara freezes for a heartbeat—then her eyes flick past him, toward you, and her fingers tighten on the cloth.

**Threat, clear and present:** Mara still has ether on a cloth and is close enough to press it to the stranger again; the stranger is partially exposed and unsteady, and the Lanternward are split between restraining Mara and keeping Pell pinned behind you.

#### Turn 30 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my apron tight and step sideways to keep Pell in my peripheral, then shout, “Mara—don’t you dare! That’s enough, you’ll kill him!”  
To the broad Lanternward I call, “She’s still got the rag—take her wrist, not the cloth, and get him into open air—face turned away, upwind!”

*Agent reasoning: Mara’s about to use the cloth again; I can’t fight her, but I can distract and warn the Lanternward while keeping my airway covered.*

#### Turn 31 **[GAME]**

Your sideways step keeps Pell in the edge of your vision—his shoulders tense under the lantern pole, jaw working like he’s chewing through a lie.

Your shout hits Mara like a thrown stone. For an instant she falters, eyes widening, and the cloth droops an inch.

Then the broad Lanternward takes your instruction exactly the way you meant it: he doesn’t grab for the rag. He lunges for *her wrist*.

Mara twists, fast—trained fast—and the ether-cloth flicks toward his face like a slap. He turns his head away at the last second, but the edge of the rag brushes his cheekbone. He grunts, eyes watering, and still clamps down on her wrist hard enough that you hear the small, sick click of bone shifting.

Mara gasps—half pain, half fury—and tries to switch the cloth to her other hand.

“Tolan—OPEN AIR!” the broad Lanternward barks, voice thickening as he forces breath through his mouth.

Tolan obeys. He drags the stranger two more body-lengths out onto the open gravel, then drops to a knee behind him and hauls him upright, keeping the man’s face turned away from Mara and the yews. The stranger coughs again—stronger, but ragged—spit darkening his lip. His eyes crack open, unfocused.

Mara jerks against the hold. “You don’t understand—he *can’t*—”

“Enough,” the broad Lanternward snarls. He wrenches her arm behind her back and forces her down to her knees at the yew’s edge. The ether-cloth slips from her fingers and falls onto the damp grass.

But the danger doesn’t vanish—it *moves*.

Behind you, Pell suddenly bucks his weight sideways, trying to slide out from under the lantern pole while the broad Lanternward is occupied. The pole scrapes stone with a shriek. Pell’s free hand snakes toward his coat hem—toward somewhere he didn’t have time to be searched.

**Immediate threat:** Pell is trying to get free and reach for something concealed on his person, while the broad Lanternward is restraining Mara and Tolan is occupied keeping the stranger breathing in open air.

#### Turn 32 **[PLAYER]**

I lurch back to the mausoleum and stomp hard on Pell’s reaching hand/coat hem, pinning it to the stone as best I can, and shout, “He’s going for something—Pell’s armed, search him again!”

*Agent reasoning: Pell moving now means he’s about to pull something worse; I’m not strong enough to fight him cleanly, but I can stop his hand and call for help while keeping my face covered.*

#### Turn 33 **[GAME]**

You slam back against the mausoleum stones and bring your heel down where Pell’s hand disappears under his coat hem.

Your boot pins cloth and knuckles to cold marble. Pell lets out a sharp, ugly yell and his fingers spasm—something hard clinks once against stone beneath your sole, trapped.

He tries to wrench free, but you’ve got his hand caught at a bad angle. He bucks his shoulder, face twisting toward you. “You—little—” His other arm is still pinned awkwardly by the lantern pole across his chest; he can’t get leverage without scraping himself raw against it.

When you shout, the broad Lanternward’s head snaps toward you—eyes red-rimmed from the ether brush. He doesn’t release Mara, but he shifts his weight and bellows, “Tolan! On Pell—NOW!”

Tolan hesitates only long enough to make sure the stranger won’t topple: he shoves the half-conscious man into a seated slump against a low headstone base, then sprints back across the gravel.

Mara, on her knees, takes advantage of the split second. Her free hand snakes toward the dropped ether-cloth in the grass.

The broad Lanternward sees it and drives his knee into her upper back, forcing her chest-down. “Don’t,” he growls, and yanks her wrists together behind her.

Tolan hits the mausoleum hard. He drops to one knee beside you and Pell and grabs Pell’s coat hem where your boot pins it. “Hold—hold!” he snaps, then pries the fabric up with two fingers and reaches in.

His hand comes out with a compact folding knife—dark handle, salt-stained pivot—half-open from Pell’s fumbling. Tolan flings it away across the gravel; it skitters and disappears under a border of rosemary offerings.

Pell goes pale with rage, then—quick as a reflex—spits, a wet gob that lands near your boot. “Ashford,” he hisses, like it’s a curse. “You don’t know who you’re helping.”

**Current threats, clearly:** Pell is restrained but still dangerous if he wriggles free; Mara is pinned but still conscious and fighting; the stranger is sitting unattended a few paces away, breathing hard and possibly drugged, with no one watching him closely for another attempt.

#### Turn 34 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my boot planted on Pell’s hand and lean down just enough to hiss, “Spit again and I’ll grind your knuckles to bone.” Then I call to Tolan, “Stay on his wrists—tight—he’s still reaching.”  
I flick my eyes to the broad Lanternward. “That man by the headstone—check his breathing. Sit him up, open air, and keep Mara away from that cloth.”

*Agent reasoning: Pell’s knife was the immediate danger; now the stranger might slip away or crash, and Mara could still get to the ether. I want to keep Pell pinned but make sure the stranger doesn’t die on a headstone while everyone’s distracted.*

Pell freezes under your heel, breath coming in short, furious pulls. His eyes track your face, then flick to the yews as if measuring distance. He doesn’t spit again—his lips press into a thin, resentful line.

Tolan takes your cue and commits. He hooks Pell’s near wrist, then the far, forcing both hands up and away from his coat hem. “Got you,” he mutters, and shifts his grip to a painful angle that makes Pell’s shoulders bunch against the lantern pole. Pell jerks once, then stops—contained, but not calm.

The broad Lanternward doesn’t like being given orders, but he hears the practical sense in them. Without fully releasing Mara, he barks, “Mara stays down. Tolan, keep him. Pell—don’t make this worse.”

He drags Mara a half-step farther from the yew edge and the dropped cloth, pinning her wrists together with one hand while he reaches to his belt with the other. A short length of cord comes free; he starts binding her wrists.

Mara turns her face sideways against the grass, voice tight with pain. “He’ll wake wrong,” she says, words clipped. “You think that’s mercy?”

The broad Lanternward snaps back, “Mercy is *air*.”

He then strides to the slumped stranger by the headstone base, keeping his head turned away from where the ether-cloth lies. He crouches, checks the man’s chest with a gloved palm, then grips his jaw and tilts his face up into the wind. “Breathe,” he orders, as if the word can be enforced.

The stranger’s eyelids flutter. He inhales—shallow, then deeper—coughs once, and swallows hard. His gaze latches briefly on the broad Lanternward’s lantern, unfocused but present.

As the broad Lanternward shifts him more upright, something drops from the stranger’s coat pocket and lands with a soft, papery slap on the gravel: a folded square—too clean to be cemetery litter.

The broad Lanternward notices it a beat later. He doesn’t pick it up yet. His eyes lift, scanning the yew line and the blue-guttering lanterns beyond, as if expecting someone to step out and claim it.

**Clear, present danger:** Mara is bound but still fighting and could still lunge for the ether-cloth if she gets a hand free; Pell is restrained but watching for an opening; and the dropped folded paper is now exposed on the gravel—potential evidence or a signal—while the area may still have unseen accomplices nearby.

#### Turn 36 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my boot pinning Pell and call out, “Don’t touch it bare—use a glove or cloth. That paper’s evidence.”  
Then, louder toward the yews, I add, “If anyone’s out there watching, show yourself—this isn’t getting cleaner.”  
Without taking my eyes off Pell, I ask Tolan under my breath, “Can you hold him alone for ten seconds if I move the ether rag farther off?”

*Agent reasoning: That folded paper feels like the first real thread in this mess—if someone else is watching, it could be a signal. I need it secured without letting Mara or Pell exploit the moment, and I want the Lanternward to treat it as evidence, not trash.*

#### Turn 37 **[GAME]**

The broad Lanternward pauses over the folded paper, then nods once—tight, reluctant. He pulls a glove fully onto his right hand (he’d had it half-on), pinches the paper by one corner, and lifts it as if it might bite. He doesn’t unfold it yet. He holds it up to the lantern’s blue-sputtering light, angling it to catch any ink bleed-through.

At your louder call toward the yews, nothing obligingly steps out.

What you get instead is a sound: a faint *double-click* from deeper in the greenery, like two stones tapped together. Then a second, farther left. Not speech—signal.

Pell’s eyes snap toward the yews at the first click. His jaw loosens in something like satisfaction. Under your boot his fingers try to curl, testing your balance, but Tolan tightens his hold on Pell’s wrists and forces them up higher.

Tolan answers you under his breath without looking away from Pell. “Ten seconds?” He swallows. “Yes. But if he bucks, I’m breaking something.”

Mara, wrists bound, lifts her head enough to rasp, “They’re not going to show themselves. That’s not how—” The broad Lanternward cuts her off with a sharp tug on the cord, forcing her back down.

The stranger by the headstone base takes a deeper breath and then a sudden, wet cough. He doubles forward, retches once—mostly air and a thin spit—and his gaze clears just enough to snag on *you*, then Pell, then the glove-held paper. His lips part as if to speak, but only a hoarse whisper comes out: “Map… not… theirs…”

The broad Lanternward, still crouched, finally unfolds the paper one careful crease at a time.

It’s a maintenance overlay—thin vellum, inked with plot lines and narrow dotted routes that don’t match any public cemetery map. In the margin: three looping letters in an old shorthand—familiar enough to make your stomach dip, even at a glance.

The lantern beside you flares a brighter, attentive blue for a heartbeat, throwing everyone’s shadows long and sharp across the mausoleum face—your profile clear as a cutout.

And from the path below, a voice calls out with practiced cheer, closing in through the fog: “Oh! There you all are—what a *busy* little scene. Are we having an after-hours tour?”

A Lanternward tour-guide is drifting up the gravel walk, smile already in place, eyes aimed like hooks at your hands and tools and stance over Pell. The threat is immediate and social as much as physical: someone official is arriving to control the story.

#### Turn 38 **[PLAYER]**

I ease my boot off Pell’s hand but keep my weight ready, lifting both palms a fraction like I’m de-escalating. “Not a tour,” I call down to the approaching guide, steady and loud. “An assault—ether. We’ve got two restrained and one half-suffocated. Get a medic and keep your people back.”  

Without looking away, I murmur to Tolan, “Hold him—don’t break him unless you have to.” Then I flick my eyes to the broad Lanternward and tip my chin toward the unfolded vellum. “That shorthand—bag it. Now.”

*Agent reasoning: A tour-guide means optics and narrative control; I need to look nonviolent, protect evidence, and quietly signal the broad Lanternward that the map matters. Also, the ether rag is still a hazard—if I can move it without losing Pell, I should, but not if it makes us look guilty.*

#### Turn 39 **[GAME]**

Pell’s hand snaps back to his chest the moment your boot lifts. He cradles it, flexing his fingers with a grimace—hurt, but functional. He immediately tries to twist his shoulders to slip Tolan’s hold.

Tolan adjusts fast, planting a knee between Pell’s shoulder blades and hauling both wrists higher. “Stay,” Tolan growls. Pell sucks in a breath through his teeth but doesn’t get free.

Down the path, the Lanternward guide slows—then keeps coming anyway, boots crunching gravel with deliberate calm. She’s in a neat coat with a silver lantern pin; her hair is pinned back so tightly it looks painful. Her smile doesn’t reach her eyes.

“A medic,” she repeats, as if tasting the word. “Of course. We’ll see to everyone’s… comfort.” She lifts a small whistle from her pocket but doesn’t blow it yet. Instead she looks past you to the broad Lanternward and the vellum. “Steward Halden—what is that in your hand?”

Halden (broad Lanternward) hesitates a fraction at your “bag it” order—then chooses speed over argument. He snaps the vellum closed, keeping his glove on, and shoves it into the inside pocket of his coat. Not bagged—hidden on his person.

He says, loud enough for the guide to hear, “Found on the ground. Potentially connected.”

The guide’s gaze flicks to Mara, bound in the grass. “Mara? Really?” Her tone turns gently disappointed, like a teacher catching a child with ink-stained fingers. Mara’s eyes burn up at her, but she stays down, breathing hard.

The slumped stranger coughs again and manages a rasped sentence toward Halden: “Don’t—give—her—” He chokes on the last word and swallows, eyes watering.

The guide raises the whistle to her lips.

At the same time, from the yews comes a sharper sound than before: a single click, then a low, drawn-out *moan*—not a voice, not quite a bell, but close enough that the blue lanterns along the upper path answer with a brief sputter in sequence.

Halden’s head jerks toward the yews. His hand goes to the pocket where he stuffed the vellum.

The immediate threat is now twofold and concrete: the guide is about to summon more Lanternward with her whistle—likely to seize control of everyone and the evidence—while whatever is signaling from the yews is coordinating movement nearby, and Pell is watching both, poised to exploit the distraction.

#### Turn 40 **[PLAYER]**

I step toward the guide with my palms still up, voice calm but edged. “Don’t blow that. We have an active ether incident and an unknown signal in the yews—your whistle will draw people straight into it.”

I glance to Halden and jerk my chin toward the mausoleum shadow. “Halden—bag the vellum properly, now. Away from her and away from your pocket.” Then I call, “Tolan, keep Pell facedown—don’t let him watch the yews.”

Without waiting for permission, I angle my body between the guide and the scene and add, quieter but firm, “If you’re here to ‘see to comfort,’ then get your medic and keep the rest back until we know who’s clicking in the trees.”

*Agent reasoning: The guide’s whistle will turn this into a controlled narrative and we’ll lose the map; I need to stop that without escalating into a brawl, and get Halden to secure evidence properly. The yew signals mean someone’s coordinating—keep eyes up and buy seconds.*

#### Turn 42 **[PLAYER]**

I step in front of the guide, palms up in a steadying gesture. “Don’t blow that—there’s ether in the air and someone signaling in the yews. A whistle brings more people into the danger.”  
I cut my eyes to Halden and jerk my chin toward the mausoleum shadow. “Halden—bag the vellum properly, now. Not your pocket.” Then, sharp to Tolan: “Keep Pell facedown—don’t let him watch the trees.”

*Agent reasoning: The guide’s whistle could turn this into a pile of bodies and confiscated evidence; I need to slow her down and get Halden to secure the vellum properly while keeping Pell from coordinating with whoever’s in the yews.*

#### Turn 43 **[GAME]**

You get between the guide and the knot of bodies, forcing her to either stop or bump you. She stops short—close enough you can see the salt-fine mist beading on her lashes. The whistle is at her lips, but she doesn’t blow it yet.

Her eyes track your raised hands, then flick past your shoulder to Pell and the stranger. “Ether,” she repeats, voice low now, the cheer gone. “That’s a serious accusation, Miss Ashford.”

She lowers the whistle a few inches—not pocketing it, just holding it ready. “If there’s ether, you move people *downwind* and you don’t crowd a casualty.” Her gaze hooks on the slumped stranger. “Halden—get him onto the path. Now.”

Halden hears your order and makes a quick decision in the mausoleum’s shadow. He pulls a small oilskin evidence pouch from his belt—creased, used—and, keeping his glove on, transfers the folded vellum from his coat pocket into the pouch without fully exposing it again. He rolls the top, ties it off, and then—importantly—doesn’t keep it. He sets it on the mausoleum’s stone ledge behind his boot, out of the guide’s direct line of sight but not in anyone’s hands.

The guide notices the movement anyway. Her chin lifts. “What did you just bag?”

“Found property,” Halden answers, too neutral. He doesn’t offer it.

Tolan obeys immediately: he shoves Pell’s cheek into the grass and shifts his knee higher across Pell’s shoulder blades, forcing Pell’s face away from the yews. Pell snarls something muffled and tries to crane his neck; Tolan yanks his wrists up hard enough that Pell grunts and stops trying.

From the yews, the signaling changes. You hear two quick clicks—closer than before—followed by a soft scuff of shoes on damp leaves. Someone is moving, using the cover. The threat is no longer abstract: there is at least one unseen person repositioning in the trees within a few yards.

The guide’s thumb tightens on the whistle. “If someone’s in those yews,” she says, voice clipped, “we call lanterns. That’s procedure.”

She takes one half-step to angle around you for a clearer sightline—testing whether you’ll let her past—while her eyes dart between the yews and the bagged vellum’s location.

#### Turn 44 **[PLAYER]**

I shift with her half-step, keeping my body between her and the scene. “Procedure doesn’t outrank safety—if you call lanterns, you call them to the *lower gate* and you keep them out of this drift.”

I cut my gaze to Halden. “Get the casualty downwind onto the path, then stand on that pouch like it’s your oath.” Then I raise my voice toward the yews, steady and cold: “I hear you moving. Step out with your hands visible, or I start naming what you’re doing to every lantern that arrives.”

*Agent reasoning: The guide’s about to escalate and pull more people into a potentially gassed area; I need to keep her contained, get eyes on the yews, and secure the evidence without letting her seize it.*

#### Turn 45 **[GAME]**

You mirror the guide’s angle perfectly. She can’t get a clean line past you without putting hands on you—and she doesn’t. Her jaw tightens.

“Lower gate,” she repeats. The whistle hovers at her mouth again, and she makes a sharp, decisive choice: she blows it once—short, controlled, not a long alarm. The sound is bright and cutting.

A heartbeat later, somewhere below the tier, you hear it answered: one whistle back, farther off, and the faint clatter of a lantern pole against stone as someone starts moving.

Halden moves on your instruction, but he doesn’t do it gently. He hooks his arms under the slumped stranger’s shoulders and drags him onto the path, boots scraping gravel. The stranger’s head lolls; he coughs wetly and tries to speak, failing. Halden then steps back to the mausoleum ledge and plants his boot squarely in front of the oilskin pouch—blocking it with his shin like a guard at a threshold.

Tolan keeps Pell pinned facedown. Pell’s eyes squeeze shut against the grass; he stops straining his neck and instead goes very still, listening.

Your call into the yews lands. The scuffing stops.

Then, from the dark under the branches, a voice answers—soft, close, and amused in a way that doesn’t match the situation. “Naming? To lanterns?” A pause. “You think they don’t already know the words?”

A figure doesn’t step out. Instead, a small object arcs from the yews and lands on the path with a light *clink* about six feet from the casualty: a glass vial, stoppered, rolling to a stop.

It’s not smoking. But the air around it has a sharp, sweet-cold bite that makes the back of your throat prickle—the same wrongness you’ve tasted near fresh-cut stone dust and blue-guttering lanterns.

The guide’s posture changes instantly: she grabs your forearm—not hard enough to bruise, hard enough to move you—trying to pull you back from the vial and clear her sightline. “No one touches that,” she snaps, eyes fixed on the glass.

From the yews comes one more click—right, then left—like someone signaling to two positions.

Whatever is in the trees is coordinating, and the vial on the path is now a clear, immediate hazard between you and the casualty.

#### Turn 46 **[PLAYER]**

I let the guide pull me back a step, then gently peel her hand off my forearm. “Agreed—no one touches it. But you don’t get to move me like furniture.”

I angle my body so the breeze hits my face, then point with two fingers. “Halden, drag him farther downwind—now. Tolan, keep Pell pinned and quiet.”

Without taking my eyes off the yews, I call out, steady as stone: “You just tossed a vial at a dying man. Step out and say what it is, or when Lanternward arrive I’ll tell them you tried to gas a casualty—loud enough for the whole tier to hear.”

*Agent reasoning: Wren is cautious around chemicals and evidence; she won’t touch the vial, but she’ll control the guide’s grip, protect the casualty, and try to flush the hidden watcher into revealing themselves while keeping everyone downwind.*

#### Turn 47 **[GAME]**

The guide lets her hand be removed, but her eyes stay hard on you for a beat—measuring. “Fine,” she says through her teeth. “Don’t be furniture. Be *useful*.”

Halden doesn’t argue. He grips the casualty under the arms again and hauls him farther along the path, boots skidding on gravel as he drags the man past a lantern base and away from the vial. The stranger coughs once—violent—and a thread of dark spit hits the stone. He’s breathing, but it’s shallow and fast.

Tolan keeps Pell pinned, shifting his weight to keep Pell’s chest from twisting. “Quiet,” Tolan growls. Pell makes a small, furious sound and then—like a sulking child—goes limp, conserving himself.

Your threat into the yews buys you one thing: movement. Not surrender—repositioning.

A shadow detaches from the yew line on the *left*—not stepping into the open, just edging to where you can see a sleeve and a hand braced against a trunk. The hand is gloved. In it: a short lantern-hook pole, the kind used to snuff and raise wicks. Its metal tip gleams.

The voice speaks again, now closer on that side. “Gas?” A soft laugh. “No. That’s for waking.”

Then, on the *right* side of the yews, you hear a quick scrape and see a second shape move—low, crouched—crossing behind headstones. Two positions, like the clicks suggested. One is a distraction; the other is trying to flank.

The vial on the path suddenly beads with condensation, as if the air around it has cooled. The sweet-cold bite strengthens. Your eyes sting slightly. It’s not spreading like fog yet, but it’s getting more active—either reacting to air or to time.

The guide raises her whistle again, but this time she doesn’t blow it—she points it at you like a warning. “Lanternward will come from the lower gate,” she says, tight and fast. “But if you keep antagonizing whoever’s in those trees, they’ll run—or they’ll strike.”

Down the tier, footsteps and the bobbing glow of a lantern are now visible through the mist: two Lanternward coming up at a brisk pace, poles in hand. They’re still half a minute out.

Immediate threats are now clear and present:
- the vial is “activating” in the open path near you (irritant/ether-like effect increasing),
- one person in the yews has a metal hook-pole and line of sight,
- another is moving low behind stones to your right, attempting to get around you before help arrives.

#### Turn 48 **[PLAYER]**

I tug my scarf up over my nose and mouth and gesture the guide back with two sharp fingers. “Cover your face—get behind the mausoleum. If that blooms, it’ll take your lungs first.”

Keeping low, I grab a loose handful of gravel and snap it hard toward the left yew-line—aiming for the gloved hand and lantern-hook pole—then pivot and shout to the incoming Lanternward, “Yews—two hostiles! One left with a hook-pole, one flanking right behind the stones!”

Without looking away from the trees, I call to Halden, “Use your pole—pin the vial under stone or kick grit over it from a distance, don’t touch it!”

*Agent reasoning: The vial feels like it’s about to bloom into something that’ll drop all of us, and there are two attackers trying to split our attention. I’m not strong enough to fight them, but I can control space and buy seconds until Lanternward arrive—without letting the guide take charge of the evidence or the narrative.*

#### Turn 49 **[GAME]**

You get your scarf up in time; the sweet-cold sting still creeps into your eyes, but it’s dulled. Your two-finger gesture snaps the guide out of her stance. She doesn’t argue—she ducks back behind the mausoleum corner, pressing her own scarf to her mouth. “You’d better be right,” she mutters, and stays low.

You scoop gravel and whip it into the left yew-line.

It hits. A sharp *tink* on metal, then a grunt. The gloved hand jerks back; the lantern-hook pole clatters once against the trunk and dips out of sight. Leaves shiver violently where the gravel tore through.

But it also gives away your exact angle.

A split-second later, something lashes out from that same left-side cover: the hook-pole swings back into view, arcing fast and low toward the open path—not at you, but at the vial. The metal tip *hooks* the vial’s neck and drags it a foot across the stone with a squeal of glass.

The stoppered vial doesn’t break. It skitters, spins, and leaves a wet-looking track of condensation on the path. The air bite spikes—your eyes water hard even through the scarf.

On your right, the flanking shape commits: a crouched figure darts from behind a headstone, closing the gap toward Halden’s position. You see a pale sleeve and a hand holding something small and dark—too compact to be a pole, more like a tool or knife.

Your shout reaches the incoming Lanternward. Both of them accelerate instantly, poles coming up. “LEFT YEW!” one calls back, voice rough. The other veers right, trying to cut off the flanker’s line.

Halden reacts to your order with the only leverage he has: he grabs a flat, palm-sized stone from the path edge with his boot and kicks it—hard—so it skids and slaps over the vial. It doesn’t pin it perfectly, but it partially covers it, and the glass stops rolling.

The effect changes: instead of “activating” in the open air, the sting becomes a concentrated, sharp plume seeping around the stone’s edges—still dangerous, but less widespread.

The casualty, downwind, coughs again and curls inward, trying to get his face away from the air. He’s conscious enough to flinch.

The left yew attacker retreats a half-step deeper—branches swallowing the hook-pole again—while the right-side flanker is now within a few strides of Halden and the casualty, moving fast and low.

Immediate threat: the flanker is about to reach Halden/casualty; the vial is partially covered but still venting irritant around the stone; Lanternward are closing but not yet in contact.

#### Turn 50 **[PLAYER]**

I stay low and rush two steps toward the flanker’s line, then snatch up my lantern-hook pole and sweep it hard across the gravel in front of their knees to trip them. “Halden—back, keep him behind you!” I bark, then shout to the Lanternward on the right, “They’re on Halden—now, now!”

*Agent reasoning: The flanker is the immediate danger to Halden and the casualty; I’m not a fighter, but I can distract and use the cemetery terrain. I want to protect the vulnerable and keep eyes off the vial while Lanternward close in.*

#### Turn 51 **[GAME]**

You surge two steps and sweep your lantern-hook pole low across the gravel.

The flanker tries to hop it—too late. The pole catches the front of their shins with a dull *thunk* and their feet skid on the loose stones. They pitch forward, hands shooting out. Whatever they were holding—a compact, dark-handled tool—flies from their grip and skips across the path, disappearing into the grass by the mausoleum’s edge.

They hit the ground hard on one shoulder and roll, fast and practiced, trying to get their legs under them again. Close enough now, you catch details: a cemetery work-coat, salt-stained at the cuffs; a scarf tied high; and a smear of pale clay on one glove like fresh stone dust.

“Halden—back, keep him behind you!” you bark.

Halden obeys, hauling the casualty another half-step downwind and putting his own body squarely between the fallen attacker and the man on the ground. He raises his pole defensively like a quarterstaff, breathing through his teeth. “Stay DOWN,” he snaps.

Your shout to the right-side Lanternward lands at exactly the right moment. The Lanternward who’d veered right closes the last yards at a run and brings their pole down—not striking the attacker’s head, but jabbing the ferrule into the attacker’s hip and ribs to pin them to the gravel.

“Hands!” the Lanternward barks. “Hands where I can see them!”

The attacker freezes for a fraction of a second… then does something uglier: they twist their torso and slam their palm into the gravel, crushing something small under their glove. There’s a sharp *crack*—like a vial or ampoule breaking.

A thin, icy-white vapor puffs up around their hand and along the ground, hugging low like it’s heavier than air. It’s not a big cloud yet, but it’s spreading toward Halden’s boots and the casualty’s legs.

The Lanternward recoils half a step, swearing, and yanks their scarf up over their mouth. “Brine-sweet!” they rasp. “Don’t breathe it!”

From the left yews, the hook-pole scrapes stone again—still there, still moving—while the partially covered vial near the path continues to vent a sharp plume around the stone.

Right now the clear threats are:
- a new low-lying vapor spreading from the flanker’s crushed ampoule toward Halden and the casualty,
- the original vial still venting near the path,
- the left-side attacker remains in the yews with a hook-pole, uncontained.

#### Turn 52 **[PLAYER]**

I yank my scarf tighter and grab Halden’s sleeve, pulling him and the casualty two quick steps uphill and away from the ground-hugging vapor. “Up—higher ground, now. Don’t let it crawl into his mouth.”  

Then I stab my pole toward the left yews without advancing. “Lanternward—one still in the yews with a hook-pole! Keep your distance; don’t let them drag that first vial free.” I glance at the pinned attacker and snap, “What did you just break—what is it?”

*Agent reasoning: The vapor is the immediate lethal risk—get the casualty and Halden out of the low cloud; also keep the left yew attacker from interfering while Lanternward secure the downed one.*

#### Turn 53 **[GAME]**

You wrench your scarf tight and catch Halden by the sleeve. He goes with the pull immediately, dragging the casualty with him; the man’s heels scrape as you all retreat two quick steps uphill onto a slightly higher ribbon of path.

It helps. The ground-hugging vapor keeps low, spilling like cold breath across the gravel where the attacker cracked the ampoule. It curls around the Lanternward’s boots and Halden’s *former* position, but it doesn’t climb fast. The casualty coughs once, wet and panicked, then manages a thin inhale through clenched teeth—still conscious, still in trouble, but you’ve kept the worst of it from pouring straight into his face.

Your pole-stab toward the left yews draws eyes. The second Lanternward (the one who’d been coming up the path) plants their pole and swings their lantern high, trying to light the yew line without stepping into it. “I see movement,” they call—voice muffled behind cloth. “Stay out of the brush!”

In answer, the left-side attacker makes their play anyway: the hook-pole shoots out from the foliage and *snags the edge* of the flat stone Halden kicked over the first vial. Metal grates on stone; the cover shifts a few inches.

The plume around that first vial strengthens again, sharper and more immediate, and you feel it sting your eyes even uphill.

The Lanternward with the raised lantern jabs their pole forward and pins the hook-pole against a headstone corner with a hard, practiced shove—metal-on-metal *clang*. “Drop it!” they bark into the yews. “Lanternward—drop it now!”

At your question, the pinned attacker—still held at the ribs/hip by the other Lanternward’s pole—turns their head just enough for you to see their eyes above the scarf: grey, watering, furious.

They spit words like they hurt. “Moon-salt. Brine-sweet. Same thing you people keep pretending is folklore.” They cough once, then add, quieter and uglier: “It keeps you quiet. Keeps you… *compliant*.”

Their gloved hand flexes, grinding shards into the gravel.

Immediate threats are now:
- the first vial’s irritant plume is increasing again because its cover was shifted,
- the left yew attacker is still engaged and trying to free/drag that vial with the hook-pole,
- the broken ampoule’s low vapor continues to spread along the ground where the pinned attacker fell—less dangerous uphill, but it’s contaminating the area around the Lanternward holding them.

#### Turn 54 **[PLAYER]**

“Compliant,” I repeat under my breath, anger sharp in my chest. Then I look to Halden. “Get him uphill to clean air—keep his face turned into the wind. Don’t stop.”

I call to the Lanternward with the raised lantern, voice tight through my scarf: “Don’t wrestle the hook—*break their leverage*. Pin it and step on it if you have to.” Then, keeping my distance, I scrape my boot through the gravel and kick a broad fan of grit and dirt over the shifted stone and the vial’s edges, trying to smother the plume without getting close enough to breathe it.

My eyes cut back to the pinned attacker. “Who sent you? And where did you get moon-salt?”

*Agent reasoning: Wren’s protective instincts kick in—get the casualty farther from both vapors, and use her cemetery know-how to smother the vial without touching it. She’s also rattled by “compliant” and wants names and motives, but not at the cost of someone dying.*

#### Turn 55 **[GAME]**

Halden doesn’t argue. He braces the casualty under the arms and hauls him uphill, turning the man’s face into the wind like you said. “Breathe with me—short,” he orders, and keeps moving. The casualty’s coughs thin out into harsh, shallow pulls; he’s not fine, but he’s getting air.

Your instruction to the lantern-raised Lanternward lands. They stop trying to “win” the hook-pole and instead *kill the angle*: they slam their own pole down across it and put a boot on the shaft, grinding it against the headstone corner until the yew-side attacker loses purchase.

There’s a sharp crack—wood under strain—and the hook-pole end *splinters*. The yew-side attacker jerks back, suddenly holding a shortened, broken length.

A second later, a figure bolts from the yews—not toward you, but sideways, using the brush as cover. They’re fast and low, scarf up, coat flapping. The Lanternward’s lantern swings after them, but the beam catches only the white flash of a sleeve and then nothing but trembling branches. Footfalls retreat into the terraces.

Your boot-scrape and kick do what you intended, but not neatly. The fan of grit and dirt skitters over the shifted stone and the vial’s exposed edge. The plume *thickens for a breath* as you disturb it—your eyes sting hard and tears spill despite the scarf—then the dirt begins to cake over the stoppered glass and the stone settles back down. The venting drops from a sharp “bite” to a thinner seep.

You’ve reduced the immediate spread, but you’ve also made a messy, contaminated patch of gravel that will keep irritating anyone who steps into it.

Behind you, the pinned attacker flinches at your questions, then goes still. Their eyes flick—not to your face, but to the lantern-glass, catching their own reflection for a heartbeat as if checking what it reveals.

A voice answers from the path behind the mausoleum, bright with too-perfect politeness: “Oh—goodness. Is someone hurt?”

A cheerful tide-singer stands there in a damp wool cloak, hands folded as if in prayer. She looks from the casualty being hauled uphill to the grit-smeared vial patch, and then to you.

The pinned attacker’s gaze snaps to her and shuts like a door.

Under the Lanternward’s pole, the attacker rasps, “No one *sent* me.”

Then, after a pause that’s almost a dare: “Ask the Choir where they keep their ‘blessings.’”

The tide-singer’s smile doesn’t move, but her eyes do—down to the ground, to the vapor hugging the gravel, measuring distance like she’s counting steps.

#### Turn 56 **[PLAYER]**

I step sideways to put myself between the tide-singer and the contaminated gravel, keeping my pole low like a barrier. “Yes—someone’s hurt, and the ground’s fouled. Stay where you are and cover your face.”

Without taking my eyes off her, I call to the Lanternward, “Keep her back from the vapor—don’t let anyone walk through that patch.” Then I look down at the pinned attacker. “If you’re so eager to talk, start with a name—yours—or I let Lanternward decide how long you sit in irons.”

*Agent reasoning: The tide-singer’s timing feels wrong, and the attacker just pointed at the Choir; I need to protect the casualty and keep the scene controlled without provoking a panic.*

#### Turn 57 **[GAME]**

You slide sideways and get your body between the tide-singer and the fouled gravel, pole held low like a gate. It works: she stops short, cloak hem hovering just shy of the dirty, stinging patch. She doesn’t argue—she lifts the edge of her sleeve to her mouth with a practiced motion, like she’s done it before.

One Lanternward (the one not pinning the attacker) immediately shifts to your call. He angles his lantern to mark the contaminated ground and points with the butt of his pole. “No one steps here,” he orders, voice rough. He positions himself half a pace behind the tide-singer, not touching her, but ready to block her retreat or advance.

The tide-singer’s eyes flick to that Lanternward, then back to you. “I only came because I heard shouting,” she says, polite as a pamphlet. “If there’s been… an incident… the Choir can provide clean cloth and vinegar. For the lungs.”

Behind you uphill, Halden is still moving with the casualty; you hear him call, “He’s wheezing—keep him awake!” Their footsteps fade a little farther up the tier.

When you drop your gaze to the pinned attacker and demand a name, they tense under the pole. The Lanternward holding them presses the ferrule in harder; the attacker lets out a short grunt, then forces their breathing shallow through the scarf.

For a moment they look like they’ll spit defiance again—then their eyes cut to the tide-singer, and their bravado falters.

“Jory,” they rasp finally. “Jory Latch.”

The tide-singer’s head tilts a fraction at the name—small, almost involuntary. She covers it quickly with a soft, concerned sound. “Oh. Jory.”

Jory’s gaze hardens at her. “Don’t,” they hiss.

The danger shifts rather than vanishes:
- the fouled gravel patch is still active; anyone stepping into it will get stinging eyes and coughing fits, especially downwind
- Jory is restrained but conscious and desperate; their hands are free enough to try another concealed trick if they have one
- the tide-singer is staying put, but she’s now clearly connected to the name you got, and she’s watching the scene with careful attention—not panic

#### Turn 58 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my pole low between us and the fouled gravel and fix the tide-singer with a steady look. “You know him. Name, rank—what do you call yourself, and why does ‘Jory Latch’ make you flinch?”

Without looking away, I call to the Lanternward pinning Jory, “Bind their hands—now. Check their pockets for more glass.” Then, quieter to Jory, “If the Choir didn’t send you, tell me who taught you to carry moon-salt into a graveyard.”

*Agent reasoning: The tide-singer’s reaction to Jory’s name feels like a thread worth tugging, but the immediate priority is keeping everyone out of the contaminated patch and getting the casualty help; I’ll press the tide-singer for specifics while making sure Jory can’t pull another trick.*

#### Turn 59 **[GAME]**

The tide-singer’s polite mask tightens—not a smile anymore, just a controlled line. She keeps her sleeve over her mouth and answers as if reciting something approved.

“Maris Pell,” she says. “Brine-Choir—shore steward.” Her eyes stay on you, but her attention keeps darting to the lantern marking the contaminated patch. “And I didn’t flinch. I recognized a congregant.”

Jory makes a small, involuntary sound—half laugh, half choke. “Congregant,” they spit. “That what we are now.”

At your order, the Lanternward pinning Jory doesn’t waste time. He barks, “Hands. Now.” When Jory hesitates, the ferrule digs in again. Jory’s hands come forward.

The other Lanternward steps in with cord from his belt—rough twine that smells of tar—and binds Jory’s wrists tight. As he does, he pats down Jory’s coat and trouser pockets with quick, practiced strikes.

“More glass,” he mutters, and pulls out:
- a second small ampoule wrapped in waxed paper (unbroken),
- a flat tin with a salt-crusted seam,
- and a narrow tool—like a grave-rubbing pick, but sharper.

Maris’s gaze fixes on the flat tin. For the first time her composure slips; she takes one step back—straight into the Lanternward’s space behind her—then stops herself.

“Careful,” she says, voice suddenly urgent. “Don’t open that here.”

The Lanternward pauses, tin in hand, looking to his partner. “Is it more of the same?”

Your quieter question to Jory lands differently than your threats. Jory’s shoulders sag a fraction, as if the bindings have made honesty cheaper.

“They taught us at the lantern-shed,” Jory whispers, eyes reddened and watering. “Not the Choir. Not—” Their gaze flicks to Maris and away. “A man with ink-stained fingers. Said it was ‘for keeping order.’ Said the cemetery’s been… drifting.”

Maris’s eyes go sharp at that. “You’re lying,” she says, but she doesn’t sound sure—she sounds frightened of what it would mean if Jory isn’t.

Downhill, the fouled patch still breathes thinly where you kicked grit over it. The wind shifts once, and the sting reaches your eyes again—warning you that if anyone opens that tin, whatever’s inside could ride the same air.

“Don’t open it,” I say sharply, eyes flicking to the tin. “Wrap it back up—double cloth—and get it uphill with Halden, out of this air.”

I turn my steady stare on Maris. “Shore steward, then steward the truth: why does that tin scare you, and who in the Lanternward has ink-stained fingers?” 

Then, to Jory, quieter but hard: “Which lantern-shed. When. And did you come for Halden, or for what’s buried here?”

*Agent reasoning: The tin sounds dangerous and the wind’s shifting; I need it contained and everyone kept out of the fouled air. Jory’s “lantern-shed” detail feels like a lead, and Maris’s reaction suggests she knows more than she’s saying—press her, but keep it controlled.*

#### Turn 62 **[PLAYER]**

“Don’t open it,” I snap at the Lanternward with the tin. “Wrap it—double cloth—and take it uphill to Halden, out of this air.”

I square my shoulders toward Maris, pole still low as a barrier. “Shore steward, then steward the truth: why does that tin scare you, and which Lanternward has ink-stained fingers?”

Then I tip my head down to Jory, voice tight and low. “Which lantern-shed. When. And did you come for Halden— or for what’s buried here?”

*Agent reasoning: The tin feels like the next disaster waiting to happen, so I need it moved to clean air; Maris and Jory both reacted to it, so pressing them now might crack the story before anyone runs.*

#### Turn 63 **[GAME]**

The Lanternward with the tin freezes at your snap, then obeys fast. He yanks off his own neck-cloth, folds it twice around the salt-crusted tin, and knots it with tarry twine until it’s a bundled brick. He doesn’t hand it off—he keeps it at arm’s length like it might bite.

“Up,” his partner orders, and the man moves uphill at a quick walk, staying upwind of the fouled gravel as best he can. As he passes, he calls toward the fading commotion above, “Halden—sealed item coming up! Don’t open—keep it out of air!”

Maris watches the bundle go with a look that’s half relief, half dread. When you press her, she draws her sleeve down just enough to speak clearly.

“That tin is brine-tithe,” she says. “Not salt. Not incense. It’s… what the drowned pay with when they want a name changed. When they want a ledger to forget.” Her eyes flick to the lantern-marked contamination. “If it’s opened in a living wind, it clings. It finds mouths.”

On “ink-stained fingers,” she hesitates. The hesitation is real; she’s choosing which danger to invite.

“There’s a clerk,” she says finally, voice tighter. “Lanternward-adjacent. Keeps the tour lists and the maintenance notes. Always smells of iron-gall ink. Everyone calls him Mr. Sallow. I don’t know his given name.”

At your last questions, Jory’s jaw works as if they’re chewing grit. Bound wrists flex uselessly against the twine.

“North lantern-shed,” Jory answers, breathy. “By the yew walk. Two nights ago—after the last tour. He—Sallow—said Halden was ‘too curious’ and you were ‘too careful.’ Said you’d both start noticing the plot shifts.”

Jory swallows, eyes darting past you toward the stones, toward the tier where the lanterns burn wrong.

“I didn’t come for Halden,” they say. “Not first. I came for the coordinates. For the grave that doesn’t want to stay in its own family. We were told it would be here tonight—because the blue lanterns would… show the path.”

Downhill, the fouled gravel patch stirs again as the wind shifts; your eyes sting, and Jory coughs once into their scarf despite themselves. The threat is immediate and practical: if the air turns toward you, you’ll all start tearing up and choking—bound or not—and anyone who panics could stumble straight into the contaminated strip.

#### Turn 64 **[PLAYER]**

I tug my scarf higher and gesture with my pole. “Everyone upwind—now. Two paces back from the marked ground, no heroics.” 

I fix Maris with a hard look as I herd her with the pole’s tip. “You’re coming uphill with us, Maris. If brine-tithe changes ledgers, then you tell me whose name they’re trying to erase.” 

Then I lean close to Jory—careful of the air—and murmur, “Coordinates to what grave, Jory? Give me the family name on the stone, and tell me what the blue lanterns ‘show’—is it light, or something else?”

*Agent reasoning: The wind’s turning and the fouled patch is getting worse; I need to move us upwind, keep Maris from bolting, and lock down what “grave that doesn’t want to stay” means while Jory’s talking.*

#### Turn 66 **[PLAYER]**

I pull my scarf up over my nose and motion with my pole. “Upwind—now. Two paces back from the marked ground. No heroics.”  
I herd Maris with the pole’s tip toward the uphill path. “You’re coming with us, Maris. If brine-tithe erases names, you tell me whose name they’re trying to wipe clean.”  
Then I lean in toward Jory, low and controlled. “Coordinates to which grave, Jory—family name on the stone. And the blue lanterns… do they *light* the path, or do they *pull* it?”

*Agent reasoning: The air is turning and the fouled gravel is still a hazard; I need to get everyone upwind and keep Maris close while pressing Jory for specifics before panic makes them clam up.*

#### Turn 67 **[GAME]**

Your order cuts through the coughing and gawking. The two Lanternward on your side of the marked strip retreat immediately—boots scraping gravel as they take two full paces back, then another when the wind twitches. One of them drags a fallen lantern-hook with his heel to keep anyone from stepping forward.

Maris moves when you herd her, but not obediently—calculating. She keeps her face angled away from the contaminated patch and follows the uphill path, shoulders tight like she expects a hand on her collar at any moment.

“You don’t get to *take* me uphill,” she says through her scarf, then adds, quieter, “but you’re right about one thing: if that tin’s opened down here, we’ll have more than tears.”

At your demand—whose name—they reach the first bend where the wind is cleaner and the blue guttering is less direct. Maris stops, puts a palm on the iron rail, and finally answers in a clipped spill:

“They aren’t erasing a fisherman. They’re erasing a *witness*.” Her eyes flick to you. “A woman tied to Ashford & Daughters. Someone whose shorthand shows up where it shouldn’t.”

Behind you, Jory flinches when you lean in, then steadies—eyes red-rimmed from the sting. They angle their mouth toward your ear to keep their words from carrying.

“Not light,” Jory whispers. “It *pulls*. Like a tide under glass.”

They give you the grave as if reciting a lesson they hate: “Family name: **CROFT**. Plot used to be Croft—third tier, east of the rosemary row. But the stone won’t sit. The border keeps… correcting itself. Like it wants another family’s dirt.”

Jory’s gaze darts past you to the lanterns uphill. “The blue doesn’t show a path on the ground. It shows it in the *air*—a thin shimmer, like heat over tar. If you breathe it in, you start walking the line without meaning to.”

As if to prove the point, one of the Lanternward nearest the strip takes a half-step forward without thinking—eyes unfocused for a beat—then jolts back when his partner grabs his sleeve hard enough to tear a stitch.

Uphill, above the bend, a bell buoy moans once—too close to be from the shore—answered by a smaller, metal-on-metal click from somewhere within the cemetery structures. The north lantern-shed, if it’s open, just announced itself.

#### Turn 68 **[PLAYER]**

I go very still at “Ashford & Daughters,” then keep moving, voice low. “Say her name, Maris—out loud. If it’s mine to carry, I’ll carry it.”

I wave the nearest Lanternward closer without letting them step downwind. “Two of you on Jory—eyes on their feet, no drifting. The rest with me to the north lantern-shed; scarves up, mouths closed if you can manage it.”

As we start uphill, I murmur to Jory, “If the blue starts pulling, you tell me before you move—do you hear anything when it happens, like surf in a shell?”

*Agent reasoning: The mention of a witness tied to my family and the lantern-shed click feels urgent; I need to keep everyone from breathing the “pull” while pressing Maris for specifics and moving toward the shed before evidence disappears.*

#### Turn 69 **[GAME]**

Maris’s steps falter at your request. She looks at the iron guide-rail your hand brushed a moment ago, then at the lanterns, as if weighing which parts of the cemetery can “hear.”

“You don’t want that said here,” she mutters—too late, because you’ve already asked for it.

She swallows and says it anyway, sharp and resentful, pitched low but audible in the rail’s reach: “**Iris Ashford.**”

The effect is immediate and ugly.

A thin bell-buoy moan threads through the mist—closer than any shoreline buoy has a right to be—and the nearest lanterns along the tier dim half a shade, blue-sputtering like they’ve turned their wicks toward your voice. For two heartbeats the air feels tight, as if the cemetery is holding it.

A pale moth—thumbprint-sized, almost colorless—lifts from the nearest lantern-glass where it had been still as a fleck of ash. It flutters in a small, deliberate spiral, then darts away upslope toward the Lanternward office roofs, as if carrying the sound with it.

The Lanternward you beckon do exactly what you say: two fall in on Jory, each taking an elbow and keeping their own faces turned upwind. One of them—older, with a split thumbnail—keeps repeating, “Feet still. Eyes on me,” like a charm. The rest bunch with you toward the north lantern-shed, scarves up, mouths shut.

Jory answers your murmur without moving their feet, voice strained. “Yes. Like surf in a shell—only it’s… backwards. Like it’s pulling the sound *in*.”

You make it another dozen paces uphill when a figure steps out from between two leaning marbles ahead—close enough that they must have been waiting just off the path.

A Brine-Choir “volunteer,” by the sash and the neat hymn-book tucked under one arm. Their scarf is white, their smile practiced, and their eyes go straight to you.

“Wren Ashford,” they say softly, as if greeting you at a service. “I heard you were asking after your mother. The sea keeps excellent records, dear. Better than stone.”

They angle their body to block the cleanest line toward the north lantern-shed without looking like they’re blocking anything at all.

Behind you, from a side tier, a Lanternward caretaker in a dark apron appears and begins drifting parallel to your group—close enough to listen, far enough to claim coincidence—hand already on a ring of keys.

The threat is clear now: the name you drew out has sent an alert through the lantern network. The Choir has arrived to “help” on their terms, and Lanternward attention is closing in just as you try to reach the shed.

#### Turn 70 **[PLAYER]**

I stop just short of the volunteer’s “accidental” block, chin lifting the way I do with tourists who want to pocket sea-glass from graves. “Then you’ll know records can be forged—especially when they’re wet.”  

I angle my body sideways, not pushing past, just making it clear I’m not yielding the path. To the Lanternward behind me, I keep my voice low. “Keys—now. Open the north lantern-shed and hold it. No one goes in alone.”  

Then I look back to the volunteer, eyes steady over my scarf. “If you’ve come to *help*, you can start by telling me who’s paying brine-tithe to scrub Iris Ashford from ledgers.”  

Without waiting for an answer, I murmur to Jory, “If you feel the pull, lean into the Lanternward holding you—don’t fight it alone. And keep your mouth shut.”

*Agent reasoning: The Choir volunteer is trying to control the route and the conversation; I need access to the north lantern-shed without escalating into a scene. I’ll use polite cemetery-professional authority, keep my voice low to avoid “feeding” the lanterns, and redirect Lanternward to secure the shed while I distract the Choir and probe for what they know about my mother.*

My eyes settle back on the volunteer. “If you’ve come to help, tell me who’s paying brine-tithe to scrub Iris Ashford from the ledgers.” Then, without looking, I murmur to Jory, “If you feel the pull, lean into the Lanternward holding you—don’t fight it. Mouth shut.”

*Agent reasoning: The Choir volunteer is trying to control the flow and the Lanternward caretaker with keys is a liability; I need the shed open under our control and to press for who’s behind the brine-tithe without giving them room to isolate me or Jory.*

I shift one step to the side to keep the volunteer from fully blocking us, and I snap my fingers once at the caretaker with the keys. “Now—open the north lantern-shed and stand the door with me.”  

I keep my gaze on the volunteer. “If you’re here to offer hymns, save them. Who is paying brine-tithe to erase Iris Ashford?”  

Then I glance at Jory over my scarf. “Blink twice if you hear the surf-in-a-shell starting—don’t speak.”

*Agent reasoning: The silence feels like the air “pulling” again—dangerous to linger. I need the shed open to get out of the open tiers, and I want to keep the volunteer talking without letting them control the path.*

#### Turn 75 **[GAME]**

Your sidestep keeps the path from becoming a full stop, but it also exposes what the volunteer was hiding: their stance isn’t casual—they’re planted to funnel you toward the open tier where the lanterns have the cleanest line of sight.

The caretaker with the keys—dark apron, salt-stiff sleeves—doesn’t hurry at your snap. He looks past you to the volunteer first, then to the two Lanternward bracing Jory. His jaw works once. Still, he peels off from the parallel drift and strides upslope, keys already in hand.

“North shed’s sealed for relamping,” he says, loud enough to be a rule rather than an answer. Then, lower, to you as he passes: “If you’re forcing it, you’re owning it.”

He reaches the north lantern-shed: a squat timber box with a copper vent cap and a door banded in iron. The key ring clinks. He tries the first key—wrong. Second—wrong. Third—**it turns**, but not cleanly. Something inside the lock resists like grit.

He puts his shoulder in, and the door opens a handspan with a wet-sounding sigh, as if the hinge has been recently oiled with something thicker than oil. A ribbon of cold, blue light leaks out at ankle height.

The Brine-Choir volunteer doesn’t answer your question directly. They smile wider, and their thumb strokes the hymn-book’s spine—one, two, three—like counting.

“Brine-tithe isn’t *payment*,” they say. “It’s **due**. And names aren’t erased, Wren. They’re… *moved to where they belong.*”

They tilt their chin toward the shed. “You should be careful what you open. The Lanternward hates a mess.”

At your glance, Jory blinks once—hard—then a second time, slower. The two Lanternward holding them tighten their grip automatically. Jory’s throat works as if swallowing water that isn’t there, but they keep their lips sealed.

Then the lanterns along your tier gutter in sequence—left to right—blue flames bowing as if in a wind that only they can feel. The “pull” hits the group as a physical tug: not enough to drag feet, but enough to make balance go wrong. Gravel skitters under boots.

From inside the shed comes a clear, small sound: **a tool laid carefully on wood**.

The caretaker freezes with the door half-open, keys still in his fist. “Someone’s in there,” he says, voice gone flat. “And they weren’t supposed to be.”

#### Turn 76 **[PLAYER]**

I plant my boots wide and grab the shed door edge with my gloved hand, using it like an anchor. “Then we don’t go fishing in the dark—Caretaker, stay on the latch with me. Lanternward, form a line: one hand on the person ahead, keep your feet.”  

I lift my voice into the crack of blue light. “Whoever’s inside—hands where I can see them and step back from the door. I’m not here to hurt you, but I *will* shut this and seal you in if you make me.”  

Without turning my head, I snap softly, “Jory—eyes on me. Breathe through the cloth. Don’t look at the lanterns.” Then, to the volunteer, cold and careful: “You said names get moved. Tell me where Iris was ‘moved,’ or you can stand here and watch me start breaking locks.”

*Agent reasoning: The shed is the immediate danger and the source of the pull; I need to keep everyone anchored and prevent the Choir from controlling the scene. I’ll take the door with the caretaker, keep Jory safe, and force whoever’s inside to show hands before we enter.*

Your grip on the iron-banded door works: the “pull” that’s upsetting everyone else’s balance tugs at your shoulders, but the door gives you something solid to argue with. The caretaker hesitates—then plants his boots beside yours and clamps his hand over the latch edge like he’s afraid it’ll bite.

The Lanternward nearest you try to comply. They string out into an awkward line, each with a hand on the next person’s sleeve or belt. It steadies them, but not cleanly—two of them stagger anyway when the lanterns gutter again, and their boots scrape half-moons in the gravel.

You call into the crack of blue light.

For a beat, nothing.

Then a shape shifts inside—just beyond the threshold—blocking the spill of light. A voice answers from low height, as if the speaker is crouched.

“Don’t—” it says, and the word catches like a hook in the throat. “Don’t close it.”

A hand appears first, palm out, fingers stained dark as if with ink or old varnish. Then the other. Slow, careful. Whoever it is keeps their body behind the doorframe.

The caretaker leans closer despite himself. “That’s… that’s lantern-oil,” he mutters, seeing the shine on the wrist. “Fresh.”

Behind you, Jory does what you asked: eyes fixed on you, breathing shallow through cloth. Their shoulders still twitch with the tide-pull, but they don’t turn toward the lanterns. One of the Lanternward holding them whispers a prayer through clenched teeth; another tightens their grip hard enough to leave a bruise.

The Brine-Choir volunteer’s smile thins at your threat. They don’t step back; they step *sideways*, angling so they can see into the shed as if they have a right.

“Iris wasn’t ‘moved’ to a place,” they say, voice suddenly precise. “She was moved to a **line**. A margin. A footnote that can be folded shut.”

They lift their hymn-book slightly, showing its damp-swollen pages. On the inside cover—pressed into the paper like a watermark—three looping letters in your mother’s shorthand.

“Ask your family’s annex,” the volunteer adds. “Ask what they keep when grief won’t stay buried.”

Inside the shed, the hidden person’s hands tremble. Something metallic scrapes on wood again—closer to the threshold now—like a tool being nudged into reach. The blue light flares once, brighter, and the lanterns along the tier answer with a synchronized bow.

The threat is immediate and physical: if the flare pulses again, the line of Lanternward may go down like toppled stones—and whoever’s inside may bolt through the gap while everyone’s footing fails.

#### Turn 78 **[PLAYER]**

I tighten my grip on the door and hiss to the line, “Drop your center—knees bent. If you go, you go together; don’t break the chain.”  

Into the shed, gentler: “I won’t close it if you stay still. Tell me your name, and slide whatever tool that is away from the threshold—slow.”  

Then I cut my eyes to the Brine-Choir volunteer. “My family’s annex isn’t your hymn-book’s playground,” I say, voice like a blade. “You’re going to tell me what line she was moved to—whose ledger, whose hand—or you can back up and let me speak to the person you’ve cornered.”

*Agent reasoning: The blue flare is about to knock us all over; I need to steady the group and keep the person inside from bolting, while pressing the volunteer for something useful without letting them control the moment.*

#### Turn 79 **[GAME]**

The line obeys—mostly. Two Lanternward bend their knees and lower their weight; one does it a heartbeat late and stumbles into the back of the person ahead. The chain holds, but their hands clutch tighter, knuckles whitening. The “pull” through the tier eases just enough that boots stop skittering.

Inside the shed, the unseen person answers your gentle voice with a sharp inhale.

“My—” they start, then stop, like the name hurts to shape.

A small metal tool—thin, hooked, familiar as a grave-knife or etching pick—scrapes across the floorboards. It doesn’t slide away from the threshold. It slides **toward** it, then pauses, as if the person’s arm is being argued with.

Their hands rise higher, palms still out. The lantern-oil sheen on their wrists catches the blue spill.

“I’m not supposed to have one,” they whisper. “If I put it down, it— it sees.”

The caretaker beside you swallows and keeps his hand on the latch, but his eyes flick to the mounting bracket above the door—where a chalk-salt scrawl sits half-hidden under the iron banding. He doesn’t touch it. He looks like he knows better.

Your blade-voice at the Brine-Choir volunteer lands. They finally take a step back—one pace, not a retreat, more like granting you “space” they think they control. Their hymn-book remains open, thumb still marking that inside cover.

“Whose hand?” they echo, and their gaze slides past you to the lantern-glass along the path, watching reflections. “You want a hand, Wren? Watch the ones that never get dirty.”

As they say it, a lamp-tender down the tier—trimming a wick, shooing moths from the glass—stills for half a second, then resumes with exaggerated calm. She doesn’t look at you directly; she watches you in the lantern pane, counting with her thumb against the oil-can.

The blue light in the shed pulses again—stronger. The iron braid on the nearest path-lantern (third on the left past the rosemary offerings) answers with a faint, tight *click* from inside its housing, like a latch engaging.

The threat becomes concrete: the ward-lantern has “woken.” If anyone lunges or grabs at the bracket/sigil area, it will react—fast—like a guard-dog made of light and iron.

Inside the shed, the crouched figure flinches at that click. Their hands shake harder.

“I can tell you the line,” they whisper, voice cracking. “But you have to stop the lantern from listening.”

#### Turn 80 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my hand on the shed door but loosen my shoulders, voice low and steady. “No one touches the lantern. No sudden moves—Lanternward, breathe with me.”

To the caretaker, barely a whisper: “You saw the chalk-salt scrawl. Don’t wipe it—just cover it. Your coat, your hand, anything dull. Slow.”

I angle my face toward the shed crack. “I can’t stop it from listening entirely, but I can keep it calm. Tell me your name—quiet—and tell me the line. If you bolt, it’ll wake fully.”  

Then, without looking at her directly, I call down-tier toward the lamp-tender. “Hands off the wick. Step back from the lantern and show me both palms.”

*Agent reasoning: The ward-lantern is primed to bite if we rush it; I need to calm the “listening” without provoking it, and I don’t trust the lamp-tender or the volunteer. I’ll use my restoration habits—soft voice, small movements—and put the caretaker between me and the sigil while I get the person inside to talk.*

#### Turn 82 **[PLAYER]**

I don’t move my feet; I just breathe slow and even. “Nobody touches the lantern—nobody.”  

I murmur to the caretaker, “Cover the chalk-salt. Coat sleeve, palm—something dull. Easy.”  

Into the shed, soft: “Tell me your name, and the line Iris was moved to. I’ll keep the door steady.”  

Then, voice carrying down-tier without looking straight at her: “Lamp-tender—step back from the lantern and show me both hands. Now.”

*Agent reasoning: The silence feels like the Lanternward “listening” harder; I need to keep everyone calm, get the caretaker to cover the sigil without provoking it, and force the lamp-tender to reveal intent while coaxing the person in the shed to give me a name and the ledger line.*

#### Turn 84 **[PLAYER]**

I hold the shed door exactly where it is and breathe out slow. “Stay linked. Knees soft. No one touches any lantern—hear me?”  

To the caretaker, a whisper: “Cover the chalk-salt mark with your sleeve. Don’t rub—just hide it.”  

Into the shed, gentle but firm: “Name and line—now. Help me keep it calm.”  

Down-tier, voice flat: “Lamp-tender. Both hands up where I can see them, and step away from the glass.”

*Agent reasoning: The world’s gone unnervingly blank—like the lantern just swallowed sound—so I’ll ground the group with steady instructions, keep the shed door as an anchor, and try to force a response from the lamp-tender and the person inside without escalating.*

#### Turn 85 **[GAME]**

The linked Lanternward line steadies. You hear a few ragged breaths sync with yours; boots stop scraping gravel. No one lunges.

At your whisper, the caretaker shifts—slow, obedient. He slides his sleeve up over his knuckles and *covers* the chalk-salt scrawl without rubbing. The blue pulse in the nearby lantern doesn’t stop, but it dulls a fraction, like an eye half-lidded. He keeps his wrist there, trembling.

Inside the shed, the unseen person swallows hard. A face edges into the crack of the door: young, salt-pale, with lantern-oil on their fingertips and a smear of chalk at the corner of their mouth as if they’ve been biting it.

“L—Lio,” they say, barely a breath. “Lio Marr.”

The hooked tool clinks as it’s set down—carefully, not thrown. Still, the moment metal meets plank, the path-lantern answers with that tight internal *click* again.

And then the ward bites.

The air turns metallic-sweet, like pennies warmed in sugar. The blue lantern nearest you flares, and moth-shadow shapes spiral out of the glass in a tight helix—straight toward your hands on the shed door. They don’t touch your skin like insects; they *print* themselves.

A thin soot-mark blooms across your fingers and up your knuckles like a half-glove—dark, velvety, impossible to miss in lanternlight. Your grip leaves no new smear on the wood, but your hands are now visibly “tagged,” as if the lantern has signed you.

Down-tier, your command lands. The lamp-tender freezes mid-trim. She does step back—one pace—then raises both palms. Her hands are clean. Too clean for oil-work. She speaks without looking at you, voice mild and careful.

“Of course, Miss Ashford. Both hands.”

Behind her, farther down the path, a bell answers—distant, single-toned, not the buoy-bell’s moan but a crisp cemetery bell. It rings once, then again, as if acknowledging a report being received.

Inside the shed, Lio’s eyes go wide when they see the soot on your hands.

“I— I didn’t—” they whisper urgently. “The line— Iris—” Their gaze darts to the lantern, then back to you. “Upper tier, north seam. Line *Geth—*” The rest catches in their throat, like something presses on the word.

The threat is immediate and physical: your marked hands make you identifiable in lanternlight, and the answering bell suggests Lanternward attention is already being summoned up-tier.

#### Turn 86 **[PLAYER]**

I swallow the spike of panic and keep my marked hands on the door anyway. “Lio—look at me. Finish it: *Geth—what?* One more breath and say it.”

Without turning, I murmur to the caretaker, “Keep that scrawl covered. Don’t flinch, no matter what it does.”

Then, to the line, steady and quiet: “We’re backing away from the lantern—together. Three steps on my count, still linked.” I glance down-tier at the lamp-tender’s reflection in the glass. “And you—stay exactly where you are. If that bell is for me, I’d like to meet it with everyone still alive.”

*Agent reasoning: The ward has marked me and the bell means attention is coming fast; I need the rest of Lio’s clue before we’re interrupted, and I don’t trust the too-clean lamp-tender. I’ll keep everyone calm, get Lio out of the shed and out of the lantern’s direct line, and quietly redirect the group away from the tier while pressing Lio to finish the name.*

#### Turn 87 **[GAME]**

Lio’s eyes lock on yours. Their throat works once, twice—like they’re forcing air past a knot.

“Geth—” they manage, and the lantern gives a sharp *tick* in answer, as if correcting them. Lio flinches, but you don’t move your hands; the door stays steady.

“Geth…erin,” Lio finishes on a thin exhale. “Line Getherin. Upper tier, north seam. Iris was moved to—” They swallow. “—to the seam’s inside row. Not hers. Not her family.”

The moment the full word lands, the soot-mark on your hands tightens—darkening at the creases of your knuckles like ink settling into paper. It doesn’t burn, but it *pulls*, a faint tug as if something has taken hold of your signature.

The caretaker does what you told him. He keeps his sleeve over the chalk-salt scrawl, jaw clenched hard enough you can see it jump. When the lantern ticks again, he stiffens but doesn’t flinch away.

Your instruction to the linked line holds. On your count, they take three careful steps back in unison, arms still hooked. Gravel crunches; the blue flare in the nearest lantern softens from a glare to a mean, steady sputter. The moth-shadow helix loosens, no longer aimed directly at your hands—still present, but circling.

Down-tier, the lamp-tender stays exactly where she is, palms up. In the lantern’s glass you catch her reflection: her mouth curves in a small, controlled smile that doesn’t reach her eyes.

The cemetery bell rings again—closer now, not louder but *nearer*, as if the ringer is moving up-tier. Footsteps follow: two sets, measured, not running. Lanternward boots on stone edging.

A voice calls from the path bend, official and calm. “Hold position. Nobody breaks the chain.”

Another lantern is coming—its light normal-yellow at first, then briefly flickering blue at the edges as it nears the warded one.

Lio whispers fast from the shed crack, panic rising. “They’ll see your hands. They’ll say you touched it. They’ll—”

The immediate threat is clear: Lanternward responders are arriving within moments, and your soot-marked hands are visible proof they can use to accuse you of tampering with a warded lantern.

#### Turn 88 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my hands exactly where they are and raise my voice toward the approaching boots, calm and clear. “Lanternward—Wren Ashford. The ward-lantern tagged me when the tool hit the floor; I have not touched the glass, the wick, or the scrawl. We’re holding position.”

Without looking away from the shed crack, I whisper to Lio, “Breathe. Sit back from the threshold and keep your hands visible—empty. Let them see you’re not a threat.”

Then, to the caretaker in a low murmur, “When they’re close enough to hear, tell them you covered the scrawl on my instruction—no one altered it.”

*Agent reasoning: The soot-mark makes me look guilty, but panicking will get Lio hurt. I need to control the narrative before Lanternward arrives, keep the caretaker steady, and get Lio out of immediate danger without triggering the ward.*

#### Turn 90 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my marked hands on the shed door and call out, steady, “Lanternward—Elowen Ashford. The ward-lantern tagged me when the tool struck the floor; I have not touched glass, wick, or scrawl. We are holding position and backing away together.”  
Without breaking my stance, I whisper into the crack, “Lio, sit back from the threshold—hands open, empty, where they can see. Breathe with me.”  
To the caretaker, low: “When they’re in earshot, tell them you covered the chalk-salt on my instruction—no rubbing, no changes.”

*Agent reasoning: Lanternward are arriving and my hands are marked; I need to control the narrative before they decide I tampered, and keep Lio from panicking or hiding anything.*

#### Turn 91 **[GAME]**

Your voice carries cleanly up the path. The two sets of Lanternward boots slow, then stop where the lanternlight can reach them without putting them in the ward’s brightest spill.

A man answers first—Lanternward coat, brass badge, lantern on a long hook held out like a cautious offering. “Heard you,” he calls. “Hands where we can see them, Ashford. Don’t step toward the blue.”

Beside him, a woman in a neat oilskin apron lifts a small slate and a stub of chalk. She doesn’t write yet; she watches your soot-marked hands with an appraiser’s stillness. “Tagged,” she repeats, flat. “That’s a claim.”

Your whisper gets through the crack. Lio obeys: you hear a quick shuffle back from the threshold, then both their hands rise into the narrow opening—palms forward, empty, fingers trembling. They match your breathing for two counts, then lose it, then find it again.

The caretaker, still linked to you by the line, does exactly what you told him. He keeps his sleeve pressed over the chalk-salt scrawl like a bandage. Sweat beads at his hairline.

When the Lanternward pair come two steps closer—close enough that you can smell lamp-oil and wet wool—the caretaker speaks, voice hoarse but steady. “On Miss Ashford’s instruction. I covered it. No rubbing. No changes.”

The woman with the slate finally marks something down. The chalk makes a small, sharp sound. “Noted.”

Then she angles her lantern-hook so its light skims the shed door and your hands. The soot-tag doesn’t smear or flake; it sits in the skin’s creases like it’s been *stamped*. Her eyes flick from your knuckles to the shed crack.

“Lio Marr,” she says, as if she’s been expecting the name. “Step out. Slowly. Keep your hands up.”

Inside, Lio’s breath catches. They don’t move yet.

Down-tier, the lamp-tender you spotted earlier lowers her palms—just a fraction—then raises them again, like she’s signaling patience. She stays put, but her head tilts as if listening for something beyond the bell and boots.

The threat is immediate and specific: Lanternward is taking control of the scene, Lio is being ordered to emerge, and your soot-mark is being treated as evidence. If Lio bolts or if anyone breaks the linked line, the ward-lantern’s blue sputter intensifies—its moth-shadow spiral tightens, ready to “snap” toward the nearest moving hands.

#### Turn 92 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my hands where they are, voice even. “Lio—listen to me. Don’t run. Slide forward on your knees until you’re in the light, then stop. Hands up the whole time.”

I call to the woman with the slate without turning my head. “Let me speak them out. They’re responding to my voice—if you rush them, the ward snaps. I’m not moving toward the blue, and the chain stays linked.”

Then, softer into the crack, “You’re not alone, Lio. One breath—then move slow, like you’re wading.”

*Agent reasoning: Lio’s panic could trigger a bolt and set the ward off; I need to keep them calm and visible while also staking my own credibility with Lanternward. I’ll offer a controlled way for Lio to come out and ask to be the one to guide them, without stepping into the blue or breaking the chain.*

#### Turn 93 **[GAME]**

Lio’s breathing steadies on your count—one breath, then another. You hear fabric rasp against wood. A knee touches the threshold with a soft knock.

They do exactly what you said: they slide forward on their knees into the lantern’s reach, hands lifted high the whole time. Their wrists shake hard enough their fingers flutter, but they don’t drop them. When their face clears the crack, you see salt-stiff hair plastered to their forehead and a thin line of dried blood at one nostril.

The ward-lantern reacts to your voice the way you suspected: the blue sputter sharpens when the Lanternward woman shifts her hook-lantern, then eases when you speak again. The moth-shadow spiral tightens toward Lio for a heartbeat—then loosens, circling wider, as if it’s listening for the next syllable.

The woman with the slate stops advancing. She lifts her free hand, palm out, holding her partner back. “No rush,” she says, clipped. “Ashford’s right about the snap.”

Her partner—badge and hook—keeps his lantern steady and raises his voice toward Lio. “Stop where you are. Good. Don’t stand. Don’t touch the doorframe.”

Lio stops in the light, still on their knees. They swallow and speak, voice breaking. “I didn’t— I didn’t change anything. I saw the seam lantern go blue and I— I hid.”

The caretaker’s sleeve remains pressed over the chalk-salt scrawl; his linked arm trembles with strain, but he doesn’t break contact with you.

Then the down-tier lamp-tender finally moves. Not toward you—sideways, along the lower path, keeping distance from the ward’s spill. She walks with careful, practiced steps and calls up without looking directly at the blue lantern: “Supervisor Harker. You’ll want the ledger-page too, not just the hands.”

The man with the badge glances toward her, and you catch his name in the exchange—Harker, as she said. His jaw tightens. “Stay where you are, Nessa.”

Nessa doesn’t stop. She reaches a post and unhooks a small tin rattle-lantern—an auxiliary light—and begins to climb the side steps, keeping it low.

Concrete threat: Nessa is approaching with another lantern and a “ledger-page” angle, and the ward-lantern is already showing it can snap toward the nearest moving hands if the light pattern or voices change abruptly. If Nessa brings that auxiliary light too close or if Harker decides to seize Lio, the ward may lash out at whoever moves first—most likely Lio’s raised hands or your soot-marked ones.

#### Turn 94 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my soot-marked hands on the shed door and call to Harker, measured. “Supervisor—tell Nessa to stop on that stair. No auxiliary light in the spill until the blue settles; it’s already tracking hands.”

Without looking away from Lio, I soften my voice. “Lio, stay on your knees. Eyes on me, not the lantern. Tell them what you told me—upper tier, north seam, Line Getherin, and Iris moved to an inside row.”

Then, to the Lanternward woman with the slate, quiet but firm: “If you need a statement, take it now while I’m keeping it calm. My hands were tagged when the tool hit—no contact with glass, wick, or the mark.”

*Agent reasoning: The ward is keyed to voice and sudden light changes; Nessa’s extra lantern could trigger a snap. Wren will try to slow everyone down, protect Lio, and keep control by speaking calmly and setting boundaries with Harker and Nessa.*

#### Turn 95 **[GAME]**

Harker snaps his head toward the side steps. “Nessa—hold. Stair. Now.”

Nessa stops mid-ascent with her auxiliary rattle-lantern hanging low at her thigh. She doesn’t argue, but her mouth presses into a thin line. The rattle-lantern’s little tin belly gives one involuntary *chink* as it settles. The ward-lantern’s blue flame tightens toward the sound like an eye narrowing—then, when nothing else moves, it relaxes back into its wider spiral.

Your calm has a measurable effect: the blue sputter steadies from a frantic stutter to a slower, breathing flicker.

Lio keeps their gaze pinned to you and doesn’t look at the lantern. Still on their knees, they speak in short, rehearsed bursts, like repeating directions they’ve walked a hundred times.

“Upper tier,” they say. “North seam. Line—Getherin. The Iris plot—someone moved it. Inside row. Not where it belongs.” Their voice cracks on *belongs*, and their hands wobble but stay up.

The woman with the slate shifts her stance so the light catches both Lio and your soot-marked hands without throwing extra glare into the blue spill. “Statement,” she agrees, brisk. She writes as she speaks, turning your words into record. “Elowen Ashford: tagged when tool struck floor. No contact with glass, wick, or scrawl.”

Harker’s hook-lantern remains extended, steady, but his attention sharpens at “Getherin.” He repeats it as if tasting whether it should exist. “Getherin,” he says. “That line’s sealed.”

He gestures two fingers—minimal movement—to his partner. “Fetch the tier map. Not the annex overlay. The public one.” It’s an order meant to sound routine.

Nessa, still frozen on the stair, calls up quietly, “Supervisor, the public map won’t show the seam breaks.”

Harker doesn’t look at her. “It will show what it’s *supposed* to show.”

Concrete threat: Harker is already steering this toward an “official” version of events. If he decides Lio’s mention of Getherin is too dangerous for the record, he may move to detain them—or compel silence—while using your soot-tag as leverage. The ward-lantern is calmer, but it’s still tracking hands and sound; any sudden grab, lunge, or dropped lantern could make it snap.

#### Turn 96 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my hands planted and meet Harker’s lantern-lit silhouette with my voice. “Supervisor, if Getherin is sealed, then it shouldn’t be answering anyone’s mouth in your ward—yet it is. Put that in the record.”

I angle my words toward the woman with the slate. “Write it exactly: *Lio Marr stated ‘Line Getherin, upper tier north seam,’ and stated the Iris plot was moved to an inside row.* No interpretations.”

Then, careful and quiet, I add for Nessa without looking at her, “If you know the seam breaks, Nessa, say so—out loud—so it’s heard by more than one person.”

*Agent reasoning: Harker’s trying to bury what Lio said; if I let him control the record, Lio gets blamed and I become leverage. I need to anchor the truth into the Lanternward’s own notes while keeping everyone slow so the ward doesn’t snap, and I want Nessa on my side without openly challenging Harker too hard.*

#### Turn 97 **[GAME]**

Harker doesn’t answer you at first. His lantern-hook dips a fraction—enough to change the angle of light across your soot-marked fingers. The blue flame in the ward-lantern reacts to the shift: it tightens its spiral toward your knuckles, hovering there like a held breath.

The woman with the slate does what you asked. She speaks as she writes, making it audible. “Recorded verbatim: ‘Lio Marr stated, Line Getherin, upper tier north seam,’ and ‘stated the Iris plot was moved to an inside row.’” She underlines *verbatim* with a hard chalk stroke, then pauses, eyes on Harker as if daring him to contradict the page.

Harker’s jaw works. “That line doesn’t ‘answer mouths,’ Ashford,” he says, controlled. “People repeat what they hear.”

Then you press Nessa.

Nessa inhales on the stair. For a moment she looks like she might swallow it back. Instead, she lifts her chin and speaks clearly, projecting up the steps so it carries to all of you.

“I know the seam breaks,” she says. “North seam’s been opening and closing since the first blue-guttering. A hairline shift—enough to move a plot border without cracking the capstones. And the public map won’t show it.”

Harker turns his head sharply toward her. “Nessa.”

She doesn’t stop. “And the Iris plot marker was handled. Fresh tool face. Not weather.”

At the word *tool*, the caretaker flinches—his sleeve presses harder over the chalk-salt scrawl, and his elbow slides just a hair.

That tiny movement is enough.

The ward-lantern snaps.

The blue spiral lashes out in a thin, fast ribbon of light toward the nearest moving hand—the caretaker’s covered forearm—striking like a whip. There’s a sharp *sizzle* and the smell of scorched salt and singed wool. The caretaker jerks, choking on a cry, and his sleeve smokes where the ribbon hit.

His pain reflex yanks his arm—still linked to yours—down and away.

Your linked grip breaks.

The moment contact is lost, the chalk-salt beneath his sleeve flares through the fabric in a bright, cold glow, as if the mark has been waiting for air. The shed door shudders once from the inside, not from Lio—something deeper, like a latch answering a different hand.

Immediate threat: the ward-lantern is now “awake” and reactive, having successfully struck once. The chalk-salt mark has ignited under the caretaker’s sleeve, and the shed door just moved as if something inside responded to the flare.

#### Turn 98 **[PLAYER]**

“Don’t move!” I bark, sharper than I mean to—then drop my tone. “Everyone—freeze. No extra light, no grabbing.”

I edge my soot-marked hands an inch off the door, palms open and visible, and speak steadily to the caretaker. “Look at me. Slow breaths. I’m going to take your sleeve away from the mark—slow—and you’re going to let it happen.”

To Harker, clipped: “Supervisor, order him to hold still and give me one clean cloth—now. If that scrawl’s flaring, it’s answering heat and air.”

Without stepping into the blue, I reach with two fingers only—careful, minimal motion—to pinch the edge of the caretaker’s smoking sleeve and peel it back a fraction at a time, trying to expose the chalk-salt without scraping it. “Lio,” I add without looking, “stay exactly where you are. Don’t touch the frame.”

*Agent reasoning: The lantern’s awake and the scrawl is flaring—panic will get someone burned. I need to get the caretaker’s sleeve off the mark without jerking, re-link the chain if possible, and keep Lio still while I force Harker to order everyone to freeze.*

#### Turn 99 **[GAME]**

Your first bark lands like a slap. Everyone actually freezes—because they’ve just watched the lantern strike.

The ward-lantern’s blue ribbon quivers in the air for a beat, searching for the next motion. When you lower your tone and slow your hands, it doesn’t lash again; instead it tightens into a tense, watching coil pointed at the caretaker’s forearm.

The caretaker—young, freckled under soot—locks watery eyes on you and forces his breath to match yours. He’s shaking so hard his teeth click once.

Harker reacts to your order with a hard look, then chooses control over pride. “Jory—hold!” he snaps at the caretaker. To his partner: “Cloth. From the kit. White.”

The Lanternward woman with the slate tucks it under her arm, crouches without suddenness, and pulls a folded linen from a satchel at her hip—clean, pressed, official. She doesn’t throw it. She slides it across the gravel toward you with two fingers so it doesn’t *skitter*.

As you lift your soot-marked hands an inch off the shed door, the door gives a faint answering tremor—like a throat clearing behind wood. The latch does not open, but the seam darkens as if something inside pressed close and then eased away.

You pinch the edge of Jory’s smoking sleeve with two fingers and begin to peel.

The cloth resists at first, singed fibers sticking to whatever’s underneath. You go fraction by fraction. The ward-lantern tracks those two fingers with predatory attention, but it holds—no strike—so long as your motion stays slow and your voice stays even.

When the sleeve finally lifts enough to expose the chalk-salt, you see it clearly:

A scrawl of pale crystals and chalk, threaded with something wet-black, drawn in a looping shorthand that looks uncomfortably like old funeral-home notation—three looping letters repeated and crossed through. The exposed portion flares brighter the moment it hits open air, the glow crawling outward along the lines like frost spreading on glass.

Jory whimpers and tries to pull away on instinct.

Harker barks, “Hold, Jory!”

Jory clamps down, knuckles white, trembling in place.

Lio stays on their knees, hands still up, eyes fixed on you. They don’t touch the frame. They whisper, barely audible, “It’s the same hand.”

Concrete, immediate threat: the mark is actively “feeding” on air exposure—its glow intensifies as you uncover it—and the shed door has already responded once. If the glow reaches the edge of the sleeve line or touches bare skin, it may burn deeper or trigger another door movement; if Jory jerks suddenly, the ward-lantern is poised to strike moving hands again.

#### Turn 100 **[PLAYER]**

I slide the clean linen over the exposed scrawl like I’m laying gauze on fresh paint—no pressure, no rubbing—just sealing it from air. “Jory, keep breathing; don’t yank. Let the cloth do the work.”

Without looking up, I say to the Lanternward woman, “Write that too: *Lio Marr said, ‘It’s the same hand.’*” Then to Harker, tight: “That shorthand—do you recognize it, or are we all going to pretend funeral notation isn’t in your ward?”

I keep my voice low and steady toward the shed seam. “Whatever’s listening in there—no. Stay.”

*Agent reasoning: The mark is flaring with air, so I need to smother it fast without scraping; Jory’s panic and the ward-lantern’s hair-trigger mean I have to keep everyone slow and anchored, and Lio’s “same hand” feels like a vital clue to get on record immediately.*

#### Turn 101 **[GAME]**

The linen settles over the glowing scrawl with almost no sound.

The effect is immediate and visible: the chalk-salt flare dims from a hard, icy white to a muted, milk-glow that no longer crawls outward. The singed smell lessens. Jory’s trembling doesn’t stop, but the panic in it eases into something he can hold.

“Good,” Harker says under his breath—more to the situation than to you. He keeps his hook-lantern fixed, but he angles it slightly away from Jory’s forearm, reducing the blue’s direct attention.

Jory swallows and nods once, fast. “I’m—holding,” he manages, voice thin.

The Lanternward woman with the slate speaks as she writes again, crisp and audible. “Recorded: ‘Lio Marr said, It’s the same hand.’” Her chalk pauses at the end of the sentence, then continues—she’s adding more than you asked, the scratch of it quickening as if she doesn’t want to forget what she saw.

At your question about shorthand, Harker’s posture tightens. He doesn’t answer right away.

Then: “I recognize *funeral notation*,” he says carefully, each word measured. “I don’t recognize it belonging here.”

It’s not denial. It’s a boundary being drawn.

Behind the linen, the mark gives one last faint pulse—like a heartbeat muffled under cloth—and then holds steady.

Your quiet warning toward the shed seam is met with a physical response: the door stops shuddering, but the latch gives a small, deliberate *tick* from the inside, as if something tested it and decided against. A thin line of colder air slips out through the seam and brushes your fingers—brine-cold, with the metallic tang of buoy-bells.

Lio’s eyes flick to the seam despite themselves. Their hands stay up. “It hears voices,” they whisper. “Not names. Voices.”

Nessa, still on the stair, doesn’t move, but she watches Harker now instead of the lantern. “Supervisor,” she says, low, “that cloth won’t hold if he sweats through it.”

Concrete threat: the scrawl is contained but not neutralized—if the linen shifts, gets damp, or is pulled off, it may flare again and provoke the ward-lantern or the shed latch. The shed is still “responsive”; it has tested the latch from inside and vented cold air, suggesting something within is awake and listening for cues.

#### Turn 102 **[PLAYER]**

I keep one hand hovering near the linen, the other open at my side. “Nessa’s right—Jory, you’re going to overheat. Harker, have someone bring a dry second layer—waxed oilcloth if you’ve got it—and a length of twine. We bind the linen *lightly* so it can’t slip, and we keep him cool.”

I speak toward Lio without turning my head. “Lio, keep your eyes on me and tell me—what voice did it answer first? Mine, or yours?”

Then, still low, I add for the slate-woman to catch: “And write this: the latch ticked from inside when the mark pulsed.”

*Agent reasoning: The scrawl is calmer under linen but could flare if it gets damp; we need a better seal without provoking the ward or the shed. I also don’t trust Harker’s “boundary,” so I want Nessa on record and Lio kept safe while I stabilize Jory and reduce variables (heat, sweat, extra light).*

#### Turn 103 **[GAME]**

Harker doesn’t argue. He points without looking away from Jory’s arm. “Tamsin—oilcloth. Twine. Now. And don’t run.”

A second Lanternward caretaker—Tamsin, older, hair pinned under a cap—backs away from the circle and heads down the path at a fast walk, lantern held low to keep its light from flaring.

Jory nods too quickly. Sweat already beads at his temple. He keeps his forearm held out like it’s someone else’s.

The slate-woman writes as you speak. “Noted: ‘Latch ticked from inside when the mark pulsed.’” Then she adds, almost reluctantly, “Observed: cold air exhaled from seam.” She says *observed* like a shield.

You keep your hand hovering near the linen. The cloth stays in place; the glow beneath remains muted. No new lash from the ward-lantern—its blue coil stays taut, aimed, but still.

Your question to Lio cuts through the hush.

Lio’s eyes stay on you as instructed. Their throat works once. “Yours,” they answer. “It… leaned toward you when you spoke like you meant it. When I talked, it listened—when you talked, it *moved*.”

Harker’s gaze flicks to you at that, sharp and assessing, then back to the covered mark. “So it’s keyed to authority,” he mutters, half to himself.

The shed responds to the conversation in a way you can’t mistake: a slow pressure against the door from the inside—just enough to bow the wood a fraction at the seam—then release. Dust puffs from the hinge line. The latch does not open, but the *tick* repeats, closer in time to your voice than before.

Immediate, concrete threat: the shed is actively reacting to speech cadence and “command” tone; each time it tests the latch, the door flexes and sheds dust. If it finds the right cue—or if the mark is uncovered again—it may open, or something inside may force the seam. Also, Jory is starting to sweat; if moisture seeps into the linen, the containment may fail.

Tamsin has not returned yet. You have a brief window where the mark is stable but vulnerable.

#### Turn 104 **[PLAYER]**

I lower my voice to something almost conversational and stop addressing the shed entirely. “Harker—no more orders near the door. If it’s keyed to authority, you and I are ringing the bell for it.”

I glance at Jory’s face, not his arm. “Jory, sit—slowly—back against the wall. Keep your forearm lifted and still; I’ll keep the cloth sealed.” With my free hand I tug my own outer sleeve/kerchief loose and fan once, gently, to move air across his neck and temples—away from the linen.

To Lio, soft: “Good. Thank you. Don’t speak to it—just breathe with me.”

*Agent reasoning: The shed is reacting to my “authority” tone, so I need to stop feeding it cues while keeping Jory safe and the mark sealed; I’ll switch to softer speech, reduce movement, and physically cool Jory without disturbing the linen, while asking Harker to take over any commands.*

#### Turn 105 **[GAME]**

Harker takes your point with a visible effort. He clamps his mouth shut, then gestures instead—two fingers down, palm flat—signaling *quiet* to the others without speaking. Even the slate-woman’s chalk slows to shorter strokes.

The shed responds to the change like an animal deprived of a cue. The seam stops bowing. The latch does not tick again. For the first time since the strike, the door is simply a door—closed, tense, but not actively testing itself.

Jory follows your instruction. He lowers himself in a controlled slide until his back meets the shed’s outer wall, boots braced. He keeps his forearm lifted, elbow bent, the linen-covered mark held away from his body. His breathing is ragged at first, then begins to find your pace.

When you fan air across his neck and temples—careful to angle it away from the linen—his skin cools. The sweat at his hairline beads but doesn’t run down toward his arm. The linen stays dry. The muted glow under it remains steady.

Lio mirrors you: a slow inhale, a slow exhale. Their shoulders drop a fraction. They do not speak again.

Nessa moves without being told. She crouches on Jory’s other side and produces a small tin from her apron—lanolin salve, the kind used for chapped hands—then stops, looking to you for a cue before she dares bring anything near the cloth.

Harker watches the shed, then you. When he finally speaks, it’s a whisper aimed away from the door, as if he’s trying not to “ring the bell.”

“Fine,” he says. “No orders.”

Down the path, Tamsin returns at a brisk walk, not running. She carries a folded square of waxed oilcloth and a coil of thin twine held in her fist. She slows as she nears, reading the stillness, and stops just outside the lantern’s blue reach.

Concrete threat status: your de-escalation works—speech near the door clearly reduces the shed’s latch activity—but the ward-lantern remains coiled and reactive to sudden movement, and the mark is still only contained by a dry barrier. If the cloth shifts or gets damp, the glow may flare and trigger another strike or renewed door response.

#### Turn 106 **[PLAYER]**

I give Tamsin a small beckoning motion, palm down, and whisper, “Slow—set them on the ground within my reach.”  

To Nessa, I nod once toward the tin, then murmur, “Not on the cloth. Just his neck—lightly—keep him cool.”  

Keeping my eyes on Jory’s face, I slide the waxed oilcloth over the linen like a second skin, then loop the twine around his forearm twice and tie it with a loose bow-knot. “Jory, tell me the second you feel heat under there—don’t be brave.”

*Agent reasoning: The shed reacts to “authority” tone, so I’ll keep voices minimal and calm. The priority is stabilizing the linen with oilcloth and twine without triggering the ward-lantern or sweating through the barrier; I’ll use small, deliberate motions and enlist Nessa/Tamsin with silent cues.*

#### Turn 108 **[PLAYER]**

I beckon Tamsin in with a palm-down “easy,” whispering, “Set the oilcloth and twine on the ground—right there—then back away.” I nod to Nessa. “Salve on his neck only, nothing near the wrap.”  

I layer the waxed oilcloth over the linen without pressing, then loop the twine twice and tie a loose bow. “Jory—look at me. If you feel heat, tug my sleeve once. Don’t try to endure it.”

*Agent reasoning: We need to secure the covering without provoking the lantern or the shed; keep Jory calm and cool, and get everyone quieter and farther from the door.*

#### Turn 110 **[PLAYER]**

I lift my hand, palm-down, to Tamsin. “Easy—set the oilcloth and twine on the ground within my reach, then step back.”  
I nod once to Nessa. “Salve on his neck only—nothing near the wrap.”  
Keeping my eyes on Jory’s face, I slide the waxed oilcloth over the linen and tie the twine in a loose bow. “Jory—look at me. If you feel heat, tug my sleeve once. Don’t try to endure it.”

*Agent reasoning: The shed calmed when we stopped issuing commands; I need to secure the mark without provoking the lantern or the door, and set a simple signal with Jory so he doesn’t panic or “tough it out.”*

#### Turn 112 **[PLAYER]**

I raise a palm-down hand to Tamsin. “Easy—set the oilcloth and twine on the ground within my reach, then step back.”  
I tip my chin to Nessa. “Salve on his neck only—nothing near the wrap.”  
Without looking at the shed, I slide the waxed oilcloth over the linen and tie the twine in a loose bow. “Jory—look at me. If you feel heat, tug my sleeve once. Don’t try to endure it.”

*Agent reasoning: The shed calmed when we stopped “commanding” it; I need to reinforce the wrap without provoking another latch-test, and keep Jory from overheating. Quiet gestures and steady reassurance feel safest—and very Wren.*

#### Turn 113 **[GAME]**

Tamsin swallows, then does exactly as told—she crouches just long enough to set the folded oilcloth and a coil of twine on the packed earth by your knee, then retreats two steps, hands lifted like she’s afraid of brushing the wrong air.

Nessa’s fingers are already slick with a sharp-smelling salve. She keeps it to Jory’s neck and collarbone, careful, almost clinical—no touch to the linen wrap. “I’m not stupid,” she mutters, but her voice shakes. The salve leaves a faint sheen on his skin and the tight tendons at his throat ease a fraction.

You slide the waxed oilcloth over the linen without pressing. The cloth catches briefly on a frayed edge, then settles, dull and waterproof. When you loop the twine and tie the loose bow, the knot holds without biting down.

Jory forces his eyes to yours. His breathing is shallow; the whites of his eyes show. He gives a small, jerky nod—he understands.

Then the lanternlight in the room (thin, yellow) flickers—once, twice—and for half a second it gutters an unnatural blue.

Jory flinches hard. His fingers claw at your sleeve and tug once—exactly as instructed. Heat blooms under your palm where the oilcloth hovers: not a burn yet, but a sudden, feverish radiance seeping through the linen like a kettle coming to boil. The air near the wrap takes on a briny-metal smell, like wet pennies and seaweed.

From outside, beyond the shed wall, there’s a soft scrape: wood against wood, slow and deliberate—someone shifting their weight near the door, trying not to be heard.

Nessa freezes with her salve-smeared hand suspended midair. Tamsin’s eyes snap to the door; she backs another step, heel bumping a crate.

Jory keeps hold of your sleeve, knuckles whitening, waiting for what you do next.

*Simulation triggers: fail_Gether_0_5adc62, watcher_Ing Boots_0_1e3b96, guard_Ing Boots_0_87f6c3, fail_Ing Boots_0_2f5042, secret_Ing Boots_0_56f715*

#### Turn 114 **[PLAYER]**

I cover Jory’s hand with mine, steadying his grip. “I’ve got you—good. Keep breathing with me.”  

Without raising my voice, I glance at Nessa and make a small slicing gesture across my throat—*silence*—then point down toward the floor by Jory’s hip, indicating she should set the tin down and keep her hands away from the wrap.  

I lean my mouth close to Jory’s ear. “Cold air only—no water. Can you shift your elbow a finger-width higher?”  

Then, still not looking at the door, I whisper to Harker, “Someone’s out there. No titles, no commands—just… be ready to catch, not strike.”

*Agent reasoning: Jory’s warning means the mark is flaring; I need to cool and stabilize it without moisture near the wrap, and I can’t provoke whatever’s at the door with authority-talk. I’ll keep everyone quiet, ground Jory, and quietly prepare to confront the presence without escalating.*

#### Turn 115 **[GAME]**

Jory’s grip stops scrabbling and becomes purposeful under your hand—still tight, but anchored. He matches your inhale on the second try, breath catching less in his throat.

Nessa sees your slicing gesture and clamps her mouth shut mid-reply. She lowers into a careful crouch and sets the salve tin on the floor by Jory’s hip with a soft metallic tick, then pulls both hands back to her own lap, palms up, as if proving she won’t touch anything. Her eyes stay fixed on the wrapped spot, wide and resentfully obedient.

At your whisper, Jory swallows. He tries to shift his elbow; the movement is tiny, controlled—about a finger-width. The linen creaks faintly beneath the oilcloth. The heat under it surges once in response, like something noticing it’s been moved, then steadies to a hot, steady pulse. The briny-metal smell sharpens and you see a thin thread of steam—or breath that isn’t yours—curl from the edge of the oilcloth and vanish.

You whisper to Harker.

A figure at the far side of the shed—half in shadow near a stack of lobster crates—straightens. Harker had been there all along, quiet as a hung coat. He doesn’t answer aloud. He shifts his weight so he’s between Jory and the door, hands open and low like you asked, knees slightly bent.

Outside, the scrape stops.

Then the door latch lifts with a slow, careful click.

The door opens the width of a hand. A sliver of colder air slides in, carrying damp salt and the faint, sweet rot of seaweed. In the gap: an eye and part of a cheek, pale in the lanternlight, watching the floor more than your faces—as if looking for where feet are placed.

Tamsin’s heel knocks the crate again, louder this time. The watcher outside freezes. The door doesn’t close, but it stops moving.

Jory tugs your sleeve a second time—shorter, urgent. The heat under the oilcloth spikes in a single beat, enough that the waxed surface looks briefly slicker, as if sweating.

*Simulation triggers: fail_Gether_0_5adc62, watcher_Ing Boots_0_1e3b96, guard_Ing Boots_0_87f6c3, fail_Ing Boots_0_2f5042, secret_Ing Boots_0_56f715*

#### Turn 116 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my palm hovering over the oilcloth without pressing and squeeze Jory’s hand once. “I felt it—don’t move. Breathe with me, in… out.”

Without looking at the gap, I speak to the door in a calm, low voice. “If you’re here to help, come in slow with your hands empty. If you’re here to take him, you’ll have to look me in the face while you do it.”

I flick two fingers toward Tamsin—*bolt it*—then murmur to Nessa, “Slide the tin farther away with your foot. No sudden reaches.”

*Agent reasoning: Jory’s heat is escalating and the door watcher could panic; I need to de-escalate with words while keeping the wrap stable and preventing anyone from touching it.*

#### Turn 117 **[GAME]**

Your squeeze lands; Jory holds still. He drags his breath into sync with yours—ragged, but it happens. The heat under the oilcloth stays high and prickly, like a stove left too near boil, but it doesn’t spike again while he’s motionless.

At your voice to the door, the eye in the gap shifts—finally looking up. The cheek tightens as if the person is baring teeth behind closed lips.

A low answer comes through the crack, muffled and careful. “Help’s expensive, Wren Ashford.”

They know your name.

Tamsin reacts to your two-finger flick immediately. She steps in, fast but quiet, and reaches for the bolt—

—but the door nudges inward another inch at the same moment, as if the person outside is leaning weight against it. The bolt scrapes metal-on-metal and doesn’t seat. Tamsin’s face pinches with panic; she tries again, harder, and the wood shivers.

Nessa, obeying you, uses the inside edge of her boot to slide the salve tin away. It skitters across the floorboards with a soft rasp and stops under a bench.

Outside, a second sound joins the first: a wet, dragging step in the mud just beyond the threshold, not matched to the voice. Something else is there—close, low to the ground, moving like it’s heavy or hurt.

The crack widens enough to show fingers—empty hands, yes, but stained dark at the tips as if inked or brined. The person doesn’t come in. They angle their head, listening, and their gaze drops straight to Jory’s wrapped arm as if it’s a beacon.

Jory’s fingers clamp around yours again. He doesn’t tug—he just grips, pleading without moving.

Harker shifts one silent step nearer the door, hands still open, ready to catch—his shoulders squared to block a rush.

The threat is immediate and specific now: someone at the door knows who you are, is trying to force the door wider with their body weight, and something wet and dragging is positioned just outside, ready to follow if the gap opens.

#### Turn 118 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my hand over the oilcloth and meet Jory’s grip. “Stay with me. Don’t move—good.”

To the crack in the door, steady and cold: “Don’t use my name like we’re friends. Tell me yours, and tell me what that thing is at your feet.”

I nod sharply at Harker and jerk my chin toward the doorframe—brace it—then murmur to Tamsin, “Get your shoulder into it, low. Not the bolt.”

*Agent reasoning: They know my name and they’re pushing—talking buys seconds, but we need the door held and Jory kept still. I’m not going to escalate with violence; I’ll try to anchor the intruder with specifics while shifting bodies to brace the door and keep the wrap cold and undisturbed.*

#### Turn 119 **[GAME]**

Jory stays still. His grip on you is painful but controlled, like he’s using your hand as an anchor to keep his body from flinching. The oilcloth under your hovering palm continues to radiate that hard, kettle-heat; you can feel it even without touching.

At the door, there’s a pause—an inhale you can hear through the crack.

Then the voice answers, closer now, as if they’ve leaned their mouth to the gap. “Merrick,” they say. “And that’s not a *thing*. That’s a debt I dragged in so it wouldn’t find you first.”

As Merrick speaks, the wet dragging sound shifts. Something presses into the threshold from the outside, low and unseen—followed by a soft, sucking scrape like kelp pulled off stone. The smell of seaweed rot strengthens sharply.

Harker moves when you signal. He plants his shoulder and forearm against the doorframe from inside, bracing the jamb rather than the door itself, feet spread for leverage. He keeps his hands open as promised, but his stance is now a physical barrier.

Tamsin drops her weight low and drives her shoulder into the door near the latch instead of fumbling the bolt. The door gives a protesting groan and swings a hair wider under the outside pressure—then stops as Harker’s brace catches the frame. The gap holds at only a few inches, but it’s enough for you to see more.

In the sliver: Merrick’s face—young enough to still have softness at the mouth, old enough to have learned not to show it. Sea-mist beads in his lashes. His fingertips are stained a dark, briny black like old ink. He keeps his hands visible, empty, but he’s leaning his hip into the door as leverage.

And at his feet, half in the gap now, is what made the dragging sound: a sodden bundle of netting and kelp tied around something that moves in small, wrong pulses. A human forearm—bloated and pale—protrudes from the net, the skin stippled as if pickled. The hand at the end twitches, not like a living person waking, but like a reflex tugged by a current.

Merrick’s eyes flick from the bundled arm to you. “If you open this,” he says quietly, “it comes in. If you don’t… it keeps knocking until it learns the shape of your door.”

Jory squeezes your hand once, hard—still not moving his arm—his breath turning thin with fear at the sight in the gap.

#### Turn 120 **[PLAYER]**

I swallow hard and keep my hand hovering over the oilcloth, eyes locked on Jory for a beat. “You’re doing it. Breathe—stay still. I won’t let it touch you.”  

Then I lift my gaze to the crack, voice low and razor-flat. “Merrick—back that bundle away from my threshold. If it ‘learns,’ it learns from *contact*. Don’t give it the door.”  

I tilt my head toward the yard, not the room. “Tell me what it wants, and what you did to make it follow. Then—slow—slide a clean rope in with your foot and I’ll loop it around the net from here. You keep your hands empty, and you do not step inside.”

*Agent reasoning: Merrick knows my name and brought something dangerous; I need information fast and to keep Jory stable, but I can’t let that bundle inside. I’ll hold the line at the door and try to negotiate a controlled handoff outside while keeping everyone calm.*

#### Turn 121 **[GAME]**

Jory’s eyes flutter shut at your promise. He follows your count—inhale, exhale—jaw clenched so hard you hear his molars click. He does not move the wrapped arm. The heat under the oilcloth stays steady, a punishing, contained burn.

At the door, Merrick hesitates—then does what you told him.

He shifts his hip off the door and drags the kelp-net bundle backward with the side of his boot. It resists like it’s snagged on the sill. For one second the pale hand in the net curls, fingers scraping the threshold wood—contact, brief and ugly.

The bundle jerks as if yanked by an invisible tide. It thumps back into the mud outside with a wet slap.

The immediate consequence: the door pressure eases. Harker’s brace suddenly has nothing to fight and he stumbles half a step, catching himself against the frame. The gap narrows a fraction as the door swings back toward closed under its own weight, leaving only Merrick’s face and shoulder visible.

Merrick keeps his hands up, empty. His voice drops. “It wants what was taken off it. A name. A right burial. A place in the book.” His eyes flick, involuntarily, toward the cemetery hill beyond the yard as if he can see it through the boards. “I didn’t *make* it follow. I opened something I shouldn’t—down by the tide steps. I thought it was a Choir-marked cache. It wasn’t. It was… a return.”

The kelp bundle outside shifts again, dragging a shallow groove in the mud toward the door on its own, slow but determined—like a hooked fish being reeled with no line in sight. The pale hand bumps the bottom of the door once. A soft knock. Then another, slightly higher.

Merrick swears under his breath. He looks at your feet, not your face, and does exactly as instructed: he hooks his heel behind something outside and nudges a length of rope forward. A clean, pale line slides into the shed across the threshold, inch by inch. No hands. The rope is damp but not slimy—fresh hemp, not net.

Tamsin shifts to block the rope with her boot so it doesn’t snake too far in. Nessa stays frozen, eyes fixed on the moving bundle outside like she’s watching a drowned body try to sit up.

Threat, clear and present: the kelp-net “debt” is still trying to make contact with the door and is moving on its own toward the threshold again, despite Merrick backing it away. The rope is now within your reach, but the gap is still open a few inches and the thing is actively knocking upward, learning.

#### Turn 122 **[PLAYER]**

I hook the rope with two fingers and, without lifting my hand off Jory’s, nudge it toward Harker with my foot. “Loop it low around the net—don’t let it touch the sill again. Then pull it back into the yard, away from the door.”

I look at Tamsin. “On my count, shove the door shut—hard—and drop the bar. One… two… now.”

To Merrick through the narrowing crack: “If it wants the book, it comes to *me*—not him. Tide steps. Choir-marked. Tell me exactly what you opened, and what name you stole, and I’ll see if I can give it a resting place.”

*Agent reasoning: Jory’s heating up and the door-thing is learning by touch; I need to shut the gap and control the bundle from inside without letting it cross. The rope is our only safe reach tool, and Merrick’s “book” comment points to cemetery records—my turf.*

#### Turn 124 **[PLAYER]**

I keep Jory’s hand pinned gently and kick the rope toward Harker. “Low loop—around the net. Pull it back into the yard, away from the sill.”  

“Tamsin—now,” I snap, then brace my own shoulder into the door edge as she slams it shut and drops the bar.  

Through the last crack, I call to Merrick, voice tight: “Tide steps—what did you open, and what name did you take? Say it plain, or you can keep your debt.”

*Agent reasoning: The gap is still open and the debt-thing is learning the door; my priority is to get it away from the threshold and shut us in, while pressing Merrick for specifics before he bolts.*

#### Turn 126 **[PLAYER]**

I shove the rope toward Harker with my boot. “Low loop, quick—then drag it back into the yard, far from the sill.”

I slam my shoulder into the door with Tamsin. “Now—HARD. Bar it!”

Once the bar drops, I lean close to the seam and speak through the wood, controlled but shaking. “Merrick—tell me what you opened at the tide steps and the name you took. Say it plain, and I’ll try to give it a place that isn’t Jory.”

*Agent reasoning: The door’s becoming the battleground; I need it shut and Jory protected, but I also need Merrick to give me the exact details before he bolts. I’ll commit to closing the door, then try to get the name through the wood.*

#### Turn 128 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my hand over the oilcloth and squeeze Jory’s fingers once. “You’re safe—look at me. Can you feel your toes? Tell me if anything’s numb.”  
I glance to Harker and Tamsin. “Don’t unbar it for anything—wedge the frame if you can.”  
Then I press my mouth close to the seam of the door. “Merrick. I’m listening through the wood. Tide steps—what did you open, and what name did you take? Start talking.”

*Agent reasoning: The silence feels like the door finally shut—good. But we’re blind now, and that “debt” is still out there. I need everyone steady, check Jory, then get Merrick to talk through the door without reopening it.*

#### Turn 129 **[GAME]**

Jory’s fingers twitch inside yours—cold, but present. His eyes find your face and stick there like he’s using it as a nail to hang himself on.

“I—” he wets his lips, then swallows hard. “Toes… yes. Both. But my left foot feels… thick. Like it’s wrapped.”

You slide your hand a fraction on the oilcloth. Beneath it, the bundled shape at his shin gives a faint, wrong little pulse—too slow to be blood, too deliberate to be muscle. Jory flinches when it does, jaw clenched so tight his molars show.

Harker doesn’t argue. He drops to a knee by the door, shoves a broken plank and a wedge of stone into the bottom corner, then drives it home with the heel of his hand. The frame complains with a dry crackle. Tamsin drags a salt-sack from the wall and rams it against the latch side, bracing her shoulder into it like she expects the whole world to lean back.

“Not opening,” she says, breath sharp. “Not for prayers, not for mothers.”

You press your mouth to the seam.

For a moment there’s only the surf’s distant heave and the buoy-bell’s moan—then something scrapes the outside of the door, slow and careful, like a fingernail testing grain.

Merrick’s voice comes through the wood, close enough you can hear his teeth click when he speaks.

“I opened the second step,” he says, each word measured like he’s paying for them. “The one with the old nail in it. I shouldn’t’ve—Lanternward said it was sealed, but—”

He breaks off. Something wet taps the door twice from the outside. Not a knock. A drip.

“I took a name,” Merrick goes on, hoarse now. “Not mine. I thought it was just a *word* you carry to keep the sea from choosing you. That’s what the Choir said. ‘Borrow it till the next moon.’”

He draws a breath that shudders.

“It was your mother’s shorthand on the stone. Three loops. I— I said it out loud.”

Outside, right against the seam, a thin sound like thread being drawn tight.

“And it answered,” Merrick whispers. “It answered with *Jory*.”

#### Turn 130 **[PLAYER]**

My stomach drops at the mention of my mother, but I keep my palm firm over the oilcloth and meet Jory’s eyes. “Don’t listen to names, alright? Just my voice. Wiggle your toes again—both—and tell me if the thick feeling climbs.”

I press my forehead to the door seam, voice low. “Merrick, stop saying his name. Describe the mark—three loops where, on what stone, facing which way—and what exactly you *said* when you opened the second step. Word for word.”

Without looking away from Jory, I murmur to Harker and Tamsin, “Salt line the threshold inside. If it tests the seam again, we don’t answer. No more names in this room.”

*Agent reasoning: Merrick invoking my mother’s mark and Jory’s name makes this personal and dangerous; I need to keep Jory grounded, stop further “learning” through names, and get precise details about the mark without letting panic take the room.*

#### Turn 131 **[GAME]**

Jory swallows and does what you ask like it’s a rope you’ve thrown him.

“Right… your voice.” He wiggles both feet. The right responds cleanly. The left lags—then obeys, small and stubborn. His brows knit. “It’s… higher. Not to my knee. Just… ankle to calf. Like wet sand in a stocking.”

Under the oilcloth, that wrong pulse at his shin answers with a slow thump-thump, as if whatever’s wrapped there heard it had been noticed.

At the door, you feel the seam vibrate faintly when Merrick shifts his weight on the other side. He takes your warning; when he speaks again, he avoids the name like it’s a hook.

“The mark—three loops—was on a small slate,” he says, voice tight. “Not a headstone. A boundary slate. Half-buried at the tide steps’ top landing, left side as you face down to the water. Loops cut shallow, like someone didn’t want it seen unless you knew to look.”

A pause. A swallow. Then, word for word, he recites, and you can hear his shame in the precision:

“*By lantern-law and brine-breath, I unstep what was stepped. I take what was taken. I carry it till called.*”

As he finishes, something outside drags along the door’s lower edge—metal on wood—searching. The bar shivers once, hard enough to make Tamsin grunt and brace more of her weight into the salt-sack.

Harker crouches and pours a thin white line of salt along the inside threshold, careful not to break it. When he reaches the hinge side, his hand hesitates.

There, just under the lowest hinge, the rust-bloom isn’t random: a brine-bell motif scratched into the metal, neat as a signature. Beside it, three pinprick holes in a tight triangle—placed to whistle when the wind hits.

Harker’s eyes flick to yours. “Wren,” he says softly, “this door’s been used to signal.”

Outside, close to the seam, the thread-tightening sound comes again—followed by a faint, eager inhale that isn’t Merrick’s.

Then a voice that *tries* to be Merrick’s speaks through the wood, too smooth, wrong at the edges:

“Open. I said it plain.”

The salt line holds unbroken, but the doorframe creaks as if something is settling its weight to test it.

#### Turn 132 **[PLAYER]**

I tighten my hand over the oilcloth and lean close to Jory’s ear. “Good. Keep moving those toes—slow, steady. If it creeps higher, squeeze my fingers twice.”

I look at Harker and point at the brine-bell scratch. “Jam those whistle-holes—wax, cloth, anything. No more signaling.” Then to Tamsin, quiet but sharp: “No talking back. Not even ‘no.’”

I press my lips to the seam without raising my voice. “You’re not Merrick. You can’t have what’s under my hand—this threshold is salted, this door is barred, and you’re not invited.”

*Agent reasoning: The thing is mimicking Merrick to bait us into opening; I need to keep everyone quiet, reinforce the ward, and use what Merrick said plus the door’s signal mark to buy time and redirect attention away from Jory—without speaking names.*

#### Turn 133 **[GAME]**

Jory nods against your shoulder and keeps his feet moving—small flexes, steady like counting beads. His grip tightens once, then relaxes, following your rhythm. The thick feeling doesn’t jump higher immediately, but the oilcloth shifts with another deliberate thump at his shin, as if something beneath it is pressing to learn the shape of your hand.

Harker moves fast. He pulls a stub of candle from his pocket—half-used, soft from being carried—scrapes wax with his thumbnail, and kneads it into the three pinprick holes by the hinge. He packs them until the triangle is a dull, sealed smear. Then he takes a strip of cloth from his sleeve cuff and ties it tight over the brine-bell scratch like a blindfold.

“No more singing door,” he mutters.

Tamsin clamps her mouth shut so hard her jaw trembles. She doesn’t even breathe through her lips.

At the seam, you speak—carefully, without giving it anything to catch on.

For two heartbeats, there’s nothing.

Then the thing outside shifts its weight. The door bows inward a fraction; the bar groans; the wedge Harker set bites deeper with a gritty crunch. The salt line along the threshold doesn’t scatter, but it *fizzes* in three places, tiny wet pops like fat in a pan.

A sound follows—thread drawn through cloth, faster now, impatient.

Merrick’s real voice breaks through from farther back, muffled and panicked, as if he’s been dragged away from the door or is crouched down on the steps.

“It’s not me— I’m not at the seam—don’t—”

His words cut off with a sharp, involuntary gasp.

The voice at the door answers you again, still wearing Merrick’s tone like a borrowed coat, but now it’s angry enough to show seams:

“Not invited,” it repeats, savoring the phrase. “That’s a *rule.* Rules can be… amended.”

Something hard scrapes along the outside of the threshold—stone or metal—etching. The door shudders in short, testing jolts, not a full ram: it’s feeling for weakness, for a place the salt line is thin.

Under your hand, Jory suddenly squeezes your fingers twice—tight, tight—then points weakly at his own calf with his free hand, eyes wide. The “wet sand” sensation has climbed to just below his knee.

Whatever is wrapped under the oilcloth gives one stronger pulse, and you feel it push outward, as if answering the pressure at the door.

#### Turn 134 **[PLAYER]**

I turn away from the door and cup Jory’s face. “Eyes on me—breathe. I’m going to look, and it might be ugly, but it’s just a thing and we can treat it.”  
To Harker, urgent: “More salt—thick, right where it’s fizzing. And if you’ve got iron, put it across the sill.” To Tamsin: “Find me a knife and clean cloth—now.”  
Then I peel back the oilcloth from Jory’s shin just enough to see what’s pulsing, keeping my hand braced on his leg. “Tell me what you feel when I touch it—sharp, cold, burning?”

*Agent reasoning: Jory’s numbness is climbing fast and the thing outside is rewriting rules at the threshold; I need to stop feeding it attention, reinforce the salt, and check what’s under the oilcloth before it takes his leg.*

#### Turn 136 **[PLAYER]**

I cup Jory’s face and force my voice steady. “Look at me. Breathe with me—slow. I’m going to check it.”  
“Harker—salt the fizzing spots thick, and if you have any iron at all, lay it across the sill. Tamsin—knife and clean cloth, now.”  
I peel the oilcloth back just enough to see Jory’s shin, keeping my palm braced on his leg. “Tell me exactly what you feel when I touch it—cold, burning, sharp?”

*Agent reasoning: Jory’s numbness is climbing and whatever’s under the oilcloth is reacting to the door; I need to assess the wound/mark before it spreads, while keeping everyone silent and reinforcing the threshold.*

#### Turn 137 **[GAME]**

Jory locks on to your eyes like they’re a handhold. He matches your breath—ragged at first, then slower. When you say you’re going to check it, he nods once, hard.

Harker drops to his knees at the threshold. He pours a heavy ridge of salt over the three fizzing spots until it looks like spilled flour. The fizzing dulls to a damp hiss. Then he yanks a short iron nail-puller from his belt (blackened, old), and lays it flat across the sill, pinning it under the door’s inner lip as best he can without breaking the salt line.

The door answers immediately: a sharp *tap-tap-tap* from the other side, right where the iron rests, like knuckles testing a bruise. The bar flexes. The wedge squeals but holds.

Tamsin scrambles to a cupboard. You hear drawers slapped open. “I—” she starts, catches herself, and clamps down on the word. She returns with a small kitchen knife and a folded strip of linen—clean, but thin. She puts both into your free hand without speaking, eyes fixed on the oilcloth.

You peel the oilcloth back just enough.

Jory’s shin is wrapped in brine-thread—pale cord slick with saltwater sheen—stitched into his skin in looping, careful passes. It isn’t bleeding; the skin around each stitch is blanched, as if pickled. The pattern isn’t random: it traces a brine-bell shape, and at its “mouth” sits a small, dark object pressed into the flesh like a button.

When you brace your palm and touch near it, the stitches tense under your fingers as if they’re alive.

Jory sucks in air. “Cold,” he says at once—then his voice jumps. “No—cold and… *pulling.* Like it’s trying to drink the heat out of me. And sharp, right there—” He flinches and points to the dark “button.”

At the door, the false Merrick voice goes quiet.

Instead, a thin sound starts at the seam—high, papery, eager—like moth-wings worrying at cloth. The lanternlight under the door stutters blue, and the salt ridge trembles in place, grains jittering as if something is humming just beyond hearing.

Whatever is stitched into Jory’s leg gives one strong pulse—hard enough you see the brine-thread lift a fraction—answering the seam’s flutter like a call-and-response.

#### Turn 138 **[PLAYER]**

I swallow hard and keep my voice gentle for Jory. “Alright. Cold and pulling—thank you. Keep looking at me.”  
I take a pinch of Harker’s salt and rub it firmly over the dark “button,” then press the iron nail-puller against it for a few seconds to see if the thread slackens; if it does, I slide the knife tip under one loop and cut a single stitch.  
Without turning to the door, I murmur to Harker, “If that seam starts talking again, hit it with more salt—don’t answer it, just bury the sound.”

*Agent reasoning: The stitching is actively responding to whatever’s at the door; I need to disrupt the brine-thread connection fast without making Jory panic, and I want to avoid feeding it names or voice. Salt and iron seem to repel it, so I’ll use both on the “button” and cut only if it loosens.*

#### Turn 139 **[GAME]**

Salt grinds under your thumb as you rub it into the dark “button.” The sheen on it turns matte, like wet ink blotted with paper. Jory’s eyes squeeze shut for a beat—then he forces them open to find yours again.

You press the iron nail-puller to it.

The reaction is immediate and ugly: the brine-thread goes taut as harp wire, and the “button” gives a tiny, resisting *click* against the iron, like a tooth on glass. A cold shock runs up into your palm—numbing, not pain exactly, but a fast stealing of warmth. Jory gasps and his leg jerks, but your brace holds him.

The thread does slacken—only a hair, enough for one loop to rise from his skin.

You slide the knife tip under that lifted loop and cut a single stitch.

The cut thread snaps back with a wet, whip-like flick and a bead of brine pops free, splattering your knuckles. Jory makes a sound between a sob and a laugh—relief first—then his face drains as the “button” pulses hard, once, and the remaining stitches tighten in answer, drawing the pattern *inward* as if compensating for the lost loop.

At the door, the humming jitter in the salt ridge spikes. The iron across the sill *shifts* with a scrape, nudged from the other side. The bar groans again—still holding, but now under steady pressure, not testing taps.

The seam speaks—not in Merrick’s voice this time, but in a thin chorus, as if several mouths are trying to use one throat:

“Cutting makes room.”

Harker, without looking back, does exactly what you told him. He pours more salt in a thick, choking cascade along the seam and over the iron. “Shut,” he hisses, and packs it down with the flat of his hand until the words smear into muffled vibration. The speaking stops, but the pressure remains.

On Jory’s shin, the cut ends of brine-thread begin to *crawl*—slowly—seeking each other like magnet filings. They don’t reconnect yet, but they’re trying.

Tamsin grips the edge of the table so hard her fingertips whiten. “Wren,” she whispers, barely a sound, “that thing in him—if it’s a bell-clapper—”

Another shove hits the door. The wedge squeals louder. A thin line of blue light appears at the hinge side where Harker’s wax plug is—just a hairline, but new.

#### Turn 140 **[PLAYER]**

I grab the linen and press it hard over the cut ends of the brine-thread, then dump salt into the cloth so it cakes against the stitch points. “Jory—keep breathing with me. Don’t look down.”

To Harker, I nod toward the hinge-side blue line. “Brace that side—now. Anything heavy, wedge it, and salt the crack until it can’t breathe.” Then, quieter to Tamsin as I keep pressure on Jory’s leg: “If it’s a clapper, we don’t let it ring—tell me how to stop a bell without touching the bell.”

*Agent reasoning: The thread is trying to heal itself; I need to stop it from reconnecting and keep Jory grounded. The door is starting to give at the hinge, so we need reinforcement and to keep everyone from feeding it names/words.*

#### Turn 141 **[GAME]**

You mash the linen down over the cut ends and pour salt into the weave until it becomes a stiff, gritty pad. The brine-thread’s slow “seeking” motion stops under the pressure—pinned and choked. Jory’s breathing stutters when the salt hits, then steadies as you keep him anchored with your voice.

“Don’t look down,” you tell him.

He doesn’t. He stares at your mouth like he’s reading the words off your lips. “Okay. Okay.”

The cloth begins to *wet through* from underneath—not blood, but cold brine seeping up. The salt cakes and holds, turning the seep into a paste that stays put. The “button” under the remaining stitches gives a faint, stubborn throb, but it can’t pull the cut ends together while you’ve got them smothered.

Harker moves fast at your nod. He shoulders the hinge-side of the door and shoves a squat sideboard—half a step at a time—until it grinds into place against the jamb. He kicks a chair leg under it as a wedge. “Salt!” he barks, and when Tamsin fumbles the crock toward him, he pours a thick line straight into the new blue hairline. The salt *sizzles* and goes damp; the blue light dims from a line to a sickly dotted glow.

Another shove hits the door. This time the door doesn’t bow as much—your brace holds—but the hinges give a tiny metallic *ping* like a stressed wire.

Tamsin leans in close to you, voice tight and fast. “You stop a bell by damping the air,” she whispers, eyes flicking to Jory’s shin and back. “You pack the mouth. You wrap the clapper so it can’t swing. You—” She swallows. “You make it deaf.”

She reaches for Jory’s leg, then hesitates, not daring to touch the stitchwork. “If that’s a clapper, it wants a chamber. It wants a hollow. Don’t give it one.”

At the door seam, buried under salt, the chorus doesn’t speak—but it *sings* without words: a low vibration that makes the salt ridge tremble and the iron nail-puller skitter a fraction of an inch.

Under your salted linen pad, something answers with a tiny, internal *tick*—not loud, but precise.

Jory’s pupils flare. “Wren,” he whispers, terrified now, “I can hear it. Like… like it’s inside my teeth.”

The threat is clear: whatever is stitched into him is trying to “ring” through his body, and the pressure at the door is steadying—as if it has all the time in the world.

#### Turn 142 **[PLAYER]**

I press my forehead to Jory’s for a second. “Listen to me—if you can hear it, you can outlast it. Bite down on this.” I shove a corner of the linen (clean side) between his teeth like a gag and keep firm pressure on the salted pad at his shin.  

To Tamsin, urgent and low: “Wrap above the knee—tight. Make the leg dead-quiet. Belt, sash, anything.” Then to Harker, without looking up: “If that iron skitters again, pin it—nail it to the sill if you have to.”  

I lean to Jory’s ear. “I’m going to smother it until it can’t tick—tell me if the sound gets louder or if it moves.”

*Agent reasoning: The “ringing” is trying to use Jory as a resonant chamber; I need to damp it immediately with what we have—cloth, salt, pressure—and keep him calm. Also keep the door sealed by focusing Harker and Tamsin on practical bracing without engaging the entity.*

#### Turn 143 **[GAME]**

Your forehead touches Jory’s—cold sweat to cold sweat—just long enough to steal his focus back from the ticking.

He obeys when you push the clean corner of linen between his teeth. His jaw clamps down hard. It muffles the small, involuntary whimpers that keep trying to escape him.

You keep the salted pad pressed to his shin. The brine seep has nowhere to go now; it saturates the cloth and turns the salt into a heavy paste. The paste *sets* like mortar. Under it, the “tick” dulls from crisp to congested—still there, but as if heard through a wall.

Jory’s eyes flick once, sharp, as you speak into his ear. He manages a hoarse, muffled answer around the gag: “—still… here. Not moving. Not louder.” Then, after a breath, “It’s… *angry.*”

Tamsin moves on your instruction like she’s been waiting for permission. She yanks a sash from her own waist—dark, embroidered, too nice for this—and loops it high above Jory’s knee. She pulls until her knuckles go white, twisting the fabric into a tourniquet. Jory’s thigh muscles jump; his foot goes pale at the toes. The ticking stutters once—two quick beats close together—then returns slower, as if the rhythm has to work harder to travel.

At the door, Harker crouches, eyes on the sill now. When the iron nail-puller skitters again—just a nervous scrape in the salt—he swears under his breath and produces two short nails and a small hammer from his coat. He drives one nail down through the iron’s loop into the wood with a sharp *tink—tink—THUNK*. The second nail goes in at an angle like a hook. The iron can’t slide anymore.

The response from the other side is immediate: the pressure stops being a shove and becomes a sustained *lean*, as if someone has put their whole weight against the door and settled in. The sideboard creaks. The hinge-side crack you’d salted begins to weep blue again in tiny dots, like stars appearing one by one.

Then the seam does something worse than talking.

A thin wetness snakes out from under the door—brine, not water—carrying a few grains of salt with it as if it’s learning to eat the barrier. It crawls toward the nearest shadow under the sideboard, seeking a gap.

Tamsin sees it and jerks back, breathing fast. “It’s finding air,” she whispers.

Jory’s eyes widen at the same moment, and he shakes his head once, frantic. Muffled through the linen: “It’s— it’s louder. Not in my teeth. In my… *knee.*”

#### Turn 144 **[PLAYER]**

I snatch up more salt and make a hard, thick ring around the brine trail, then shove a rolled towel or rag—anything—under the sideboard’s shadow to choke the gap, packing salt into it until it’s gritty and airtight.  
To Tamsin, sharp: “Higher—wrap higher, but don’t crush him. We’re chasing it down.”  
I lean close to Jory, steadying his knee with my forearm. “Tell me the second it shifts again—up or down. You’re doing so well. Stay with me.”

*Agent reasoning: The brine is bypassing the salt barrier by seeking gaps and shadows, and the ticking is migrating upward; I need to cut off its “air” path and keep it from climbing Jory’s leg without making things worse.*

#### Turn 145 **[GAME]**

You fling a double handful of salt down in a tight circle around the brine trail. The creeping wetness hits the ring and *halts* as if it’s struck glass—then it starts to bubble at the edge, eating at the grains. It doesn’t cross, but it tests the perimeter, sliding along the inside like something nosing a fence.

You grab a rag from the floor near the stove (old dishcloth, stiff with use), roll it, and jam it under the sideboard where the shadow makes a shallow tunnel. You pack salt into and around it until the cloth turns rigid and gritty. The brine tries to wick into the rag; the salt immediately turns to paste and clogs the fibers. The leak slows to a reluctant seep.

At the door, the sustained lean shifts—someone adjusts their weight. The sideboard creaks, but your plug holds. The hinge-side “stars” of blue light blink dimmer, not gone, just frustrated.

Tamsin moves her wrap higher, as ordered—hands shaking, but precise. She slides the sash up toward the top of Jory’s thigh and loosens a fraction before tightening again, finding a balance between pressure and circulation. Jory’s foot stays pale but not dead-white now.

Jory jerks at your forearm on his knee, eyes wide. Through the linen gag his voice comes out thick and panicked: “—up. Up—” He swallows hard. “It’s… behind my kneecap. Like it’s trying to *hide* there.”

Under your salted pad at his shin, the ticking fades further—nearly gone. But in response, you feel a new, faint vibration under your forearm where you brace his knee: a small, internal *thrum* that wasn’t there before, as if the rhythm has relocated to a deeper joint where your salt and cloth can’t smother it as easily.

Harker, still by the door, glances back sharply. “It’s changing channels,” he snaps, then turns as the brine ring at the threshold suddenly spits a thin thread of wetness sideways—searching for another gap along the baseboard, away from your salt circle.

The threat is now twofold and immediate:
1) Whatever is in Jory is shifting upward toward the knee joint, where it can “ring” more effectively.
2) The brine at the door is probing laterally for an un-salted path under the baseboard, trying to bypass your choke point.

#### Turn 146 **[PLAYER]**

“Harker—don’t chase the thread, draw a wall. Salt the whole baseboard from the door to the hearth, thick as a finger. No gaps.”  

I shift closer to Jory’s knee, keeping my forearm braced, and grab whatever cloth I can—my own scarf if I have to—wrapping it snug around the knee joint. “Tamsin, help me—pack salt into the wrap at the back of his knee, right where he feels it hiding.”  

I lean in, eyes locked on Jory’s. “Up behind the kneecap—good. Tell me if it tries to climb higher than the wrap, or if it drops back down toward the shin.”

*Agent reasoning: I can’t let the door find a gap, but Jory is my priority—if it rings through his knee we lose him. I’ll direct Harker to lay a continuous salt line along the baseboard while I try to “deafen” the knee by binding and salting around the joint without cutting more stitches.*

#### Turn 147 **[GAME]**

Harker doesn’t argue. He grabs the salt crock and, instead of chasing the wandering brine thread, he pours a continuous ridge along the baseboard—starting at the door jamb and moving fast toward the hearth. He uses his boot toe to shove it into a thick, uninterrupted berm, finger-width and then some.

The probing brine reaches the baseboard, finds the new salt wall, and recoils—flattening into a trembling smear that can’t get purchase. It tries twice more, each attempt shorter, before it settles into a slow, frustrated seep under the door that goes nowhere.

At Jory’s knee, you pull off your scarf and wrap it snug around the joint, overlapping layers until the bend of the knee is bound. Tamsin immediately cups a handful of salt and packs it into the back of the wrap—right into the hollow behind the kneecap. The salt bites into damp fabric and turns heavy, forming a stiff, gritty bolster that fills the “hiding place.”

Jory’s whole leg spasms once—hard—then stills. His eyes squeeze shut; his brows knot. A strangled sound pushes into the linen gag, then stops when you hold his gaze again.

The internal thrum under your forearm falters. For two heartbeats it feels like something *pressing* against the wrap from inside, testing for give. Then the rhythm breaks: thrum—pause—thrum—long pause. The sensation doesn’t vanish, but it’s no longer building. It’s contained.

Jory forces his eyes open, staring straight at you. Muffled, precise: “It’s… stuck. It tried to go up. It can’t.” He swallows, and his gaze flicks down toward his shin. “It’s… dropping. Back down. Quiet.”

Under the salted pad at his shin, you feel one faint, resentful *tick*—then nothing you can distinguish from your own pulse.

At the door, the sustained lean releases. Not a retreat—more like a decision. The blue dots in the hinge crack dim to almost nothing.

Then a new sound replaces the pressure: a slow, deliberate scratching along the outside of the door, low near the lock, like a nail searching for a seam. Harker goes rigid, listening.

Tamsin whispers, barely audible: “It’s not trying to get in the way it was.”

The immediate threat has shifted: the brine can’t bypass your salt barrier now, but whatever is outside has stopped brute forcing the door and has begun working at the lock/edge—methodical, patient, and close.

#### Turn 148 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my palm firm on Jory’s wrapped knee and whisper, “Good—quiet is what we want. Stay with me.” Then, without looking away from him, I tell Harker, “Salt the lock and the keyhole—pack it in with wax if you’ve got it. If it’s using a nail, give it nothing to catch.”  

I glance to Tamsin. “Find us a back way out—window, cellar hatch, anything. And bring me something rigid I can splint his leg with.”  

Low to Jory’s ear: “If you hear it tick again, you tell me—immediately. Even if it’s just a whisper of sound.”

*Agent reasoning: The thing outside has changed tactics to the lock; we need to slow it without breaking our focus on Jory. I’ll keep Jory contained while directing Harker/Tamsin to reinforce the lock edge and prepare an escape route if the door fails.*

#### Turn 150 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my hand firm on Jory’s wrapped knee, voice low. “Good—quiet is what we want. Stay with me.”  

Without looking away from him, I call to Harker, “Salt the lock and keyhole—pack it in, and if you’ve got wax or tallow, seal it. Give it nothing to catch.”  

I flick my eyes to Tamsin. “Find a back way out—window, cellar hatch, anything. And bring me something rigid to splint his leg.”  

Then I lean to Jory’s ear. “If you hear it tick again, you tell me immediately—even if it’s only a whisper.”

*Agent reasoning: The scratching at the lock sounds like it’s trying to pick or pry its way in; I need to keep Jory calm and immobile while directing Harker to block the lock and Tamsin to find an escape and splint materials.*

#### Turn 151 **[GAME]**

Your hand stays firm on the salted wrap. Jory’s breathing evens out in short, controlled pulls. His eyes stay on yours like you’re a nail holding him to the room.

Harker moves immediately. He drags the salt crock to the door, crouches, and shoves salt into the keyhole with the blunt end of a spoon—packing it until it mounds and spills. The scratching outside pauses the moment the salt hits metal, then resumes higher, closer to the latch.

“Wax,” Harker mutters. He glances toward the stove and snatches a stubby candle from the mantle. He lights it off the low flame, lets it drip, and smears hot wax over the salted keyhole and along the seam where the lock plate meets the door. The wax hisses faintly as it cools.

Outside, the nail (or whatever is doing the work) scrapes once—hard—right over the lock area. The door shudders. A thin line of wax fractures, but holds. Then the sound changes: not scratching now, but a careful *pressing* along the edge, as if something flat is being slid into the seam to feel for weakness.

Tamsin nods and darts away from the kitchen, skirts gathered in both hands. You hear cupboards open, a hurried rummage, then her voice from the back hall: “Cellar’s through the pantry—there’s a hatch!”

A beat later: “Window’s painted shut—won’t budge!”

She returns with a rigid length of wood—a broken chair slat, still attached to a crosspiece like a crude brace—and a strip of twine. “This was all I could find,” she says, breathless, holding it out.

Jory flinches as the pressure at the door increases—he’s listening as much as you are. You lean close and give your instruction.

He swallows, then whispers through the linen, urgent and hoarse: “I— I don’t hear ticking. But… I feel it. Like… like a finger tapping from inside the bone.”

At the same moment, the salted wrap behind his knee darkens in one spot—damp spreading through the fabric from within, not from the outside. The salt there begins to clump and sag.

At the door, the seam gives a hair’s breadth with a soft *click*—not open, but loosened. Whatever is outside has found something to worry at.

You have two immediate, concrete problems:
1) The thing in Jory is wetting the wrap from the inside and may be dissolving its own salt barrier at the back of the knee.
2) The door’s lock seam has shifted; the outside presence is actively working the gap and is closer to forcing entry than it was seconds ago.

#### Turn 152 **[PLAYER]**

I take the chair slat from Tamsin and lash it against Jory’s leg—shin to thigh—tight enough to keep the knee from bending, then shove fresh salt into the damp spot behind his knee until it’s a hard crust again. “Don’t move it, Jory—let it sulk.”

I look up at Harker, voice sharp. “Brace the door—sideboard, table, anything—now. Then to the pantry; we’re going down.” 

To Tamsin, already pulling Jory toward me, “You lead—hatch open, clear the stairs. And if you see a lantern, light it.”

*Agent reasoning: Jory’s containment is failing at the knee, but if the door opens we’re all finished; I’ll keep Jory stable while directing a quick brace and pushing us toward the cellar escape.*

#### Turn 154 **[PLAYER]**

I snatch the chair slat from Tamsin and lash it along Jory’s leg—shin to thigh—tight enough that his knee can’t bend, then I grind fresh salt into the damp spot behind his kneecap until it crusts hard again. “Don’t fight it, Jory—let it sulk.”  

I snap my eyes up at Harker. “Brace the door—sideboard, table, whatever you’ve got. Now. Then pantry—down we go.”  

To Tamsin, already hauling Jory’s weight into me, “You lead—get the hatch open and clear the stairs. Find a lantern if there is one.”

*Agent reasoning: Jory’s knee wrap is failing from internal damp and the door’s seam is giving; we need to immobilize his leg, re-salt the weak point, and get everyone moving to the cellar before whatever’s outside forces entry.*

#### Turn 156 **[PLAYER]**

I strap the chair slat tight along Jory’s leg from thigh to shin, then press fresh salt into the damp spot behind his knee until it cakes into a hard crust. “Easy, Jory—don’t move it. Let it sulk.”

I look to Harker. “Brace the door with anything heavy—now. Then pantry, we’re going down.”

I nod Tamsin toward the back. “Lead us—hatch open, clear the stairs, and if there’s a lantern, light it.”

*Agent reasoning: The door is close to giving and Jory’s knee barrier is weakening; I need to immobilize him, reinforce the salt, and get us into the cellar fast while Harker buys time.*

#### Turn 157 **[GAME]**

The chair slat bites into Jory’s trouser leg as you lash it tight—thigh to shin—until his knee can’t flex without the whole brace resisting. He hisses through his teeth but nods, gripping the edge of the counter with white knuckles.

You press salt into the damp patch behind his kneecap. It cakes fast—wet to paste to crust—until it’s a hard, gritty scab over the linen. For a breath, the seepage stops.

Then the crust *ticks* once. Not a sound in the room—more like a tiny movement you feel through your fingertips. Jory goes still as if you’ve pinned a live wire. “It’s… mad,” he whispers. “Like it’s testing.”

Harker doesn’t argue. He lunges for the sideboard by the wall and heaves it—wood screeching over the floorboards—into a slam against the door. He shoves the kitchen table in behind it, wedging the legs so the whole stack braces at an angle.

The outside pressure answers immediately. The door bows inward a fraction and the wax along the lock seam cracks in a jagged line. Something thin scrapes along the gap—metal on wood—trying to find purchase. The braced furniture holds, but you hear the latch plate *creak* under strain.

“Pantry!” Harker snaps, already moving.

Tamsin leads hard, shoulder under Jory’s arm, guiding him across the back hall. She yanks the pantry door open. Shelves rattle—jars clink. She drops to her knees and claws aside a sack of flour and a basket of onions, revealing a square hatch in the floor with an iron ring.

She pulls. The hatch doesn’t open.

“Swelled shut,” she says, voice tight, and plants both feet for leverage. She hauls again. The ring bites her palm; she swears, then tries a third time.

The hatch gives—sudden and ugly—releasing a breath of cold air that smells of damp stone and old apples. The dark below is absolute.

Tamsin leans down into it, feeling for the first step. “Lantern—” She pats the shelf, finds one by touch, and fumbles for a match.

From the kitchen, the braced door *thumps* again—harder. The sideboard shifts a finger’s width, leaving a fresh gouge in the floor. And from Jory’s leg, under the salted crust, you feel another tiny, deliberate *tick*, as if whatever’s inside is counting the steps you’re about to take.

#### Turn 158 **[PLAYER]**

I cup my hand over the salted crust behind Jory’s knee—firm, warning pressure—then snatch the matchbook from Tamsin’s fumbling fingers and strike one hard. “Lantern. Now.”  

As the flame catches, I hiss to Tamsin, “Down first—three steps, tell me if they’re sound.” Then to Harker, without looking back, “Last one down. If that door gives, you cut it off and follow—don’t be brave.”  

I shift Jory’s arm across my shoulders and steer him to the hatch. “Eyes on me,” I murmur to him, and start easing him toward the first step once the lantern throws enough light to see stone.

*Agent reasoning: The door won’t hold forever and the ticking is escalating; we need to get underground fast, but I can’t let Jory go first in the dark. I’ll get the lantern lit, keep a hand on the salt crust to monitor it, and send Tamsin down to secure footing while Harker brings up the rear.*

#### Turn 159 **[GAME]**

Your palm over the salted crust steadies Jory—more importantly, you feel what he can’t quite name: the crust is holding, but it’s not inert. Under your hand, the “tick” becomes a faint, patient *press*, like something leaning back.

You snatch the matchbook, strike hard. The match flares sulfur-bright, and you jam it to the lantern’s wick. The lantern catches with a low *whuff* and a thin, oily smoke that curls up into the pantry air.

“Good,” Tamsin breathes, and immediately swings her legs into the hatch. She takes the lantern from you with both hands, lowers it first, and tests the first step with her boot.

“One,” she says. The stone holds.

“Two.” A gritty scrape—sound enough.

“Three.” She shifts her weight fully. “Sound. Damp, but sound.”

Behind you, the braced door takes another hit—this time not a thump but a *shove* that drags. Wood groans. The sideboard judders and slides another inch, leaving a bright raw streak in the floor. Harker glances once at the door, then at you, jaw clenched, and plants himself between it and the pantry as if to buy seconds.

“Go,” he says, voice flat. He reaches down and—without ceremony—hooks a finger through the pantry latch so it won’t swing shut on you.

You get Jory’s arm across your shoulders and steer him to the hatch. He obeys your “eyes on me” like it’s a rope to hold. His breath comes fast; sweat beads at his temple.

As you ease him toward the first step, the lantern light spills down the cellar stairwell, revealing stone steps slick with moisture and a wall lined with old shelves—empty except for a few dust-matted bottles. The air below is colder, and it carries a faint brine note that doesn’t belong in a pantry cellar.

Jory’s braced leg meets the first step awkwardly. When he puts weight on it, the salted crust behind his knee *cracks*—a hairline fracture you feel through the linen.

He flinches, and something threads a thin wetness under your palm again—slow, testing, not a gush.

From the kitchen, the latch plate gives a sharp metallic *ping*. The door doesn’t open yet, but the sound is unmistakable: whatever is working the seam has found a weak point.

Harker’s head snaps toward it. “Move,” he orders—no bravado, just urgency—as he reaches for the knife block on the counter on his way to the hatch.

#### Turn 160 **[PLAYER]**

I clamp my hand harder over the cracked salt and half-carry, half-slide Jory down onto the first step. “One at a time—don’t rush your footing, just follow my voice.”

I call up to Harker, “Take the knife, then shut the pantry door behind you—don’t leave us a straight line.” 

To Tamsin, low and quick, “When Jory’s down, find anything down there we can barricade with—crates, a door, anything—and tell me if you smell the sea stronger.”

*Agent reasoning: Jory’s salt seal is failing and the door is about to give; I need to get him down fast while keeping pressure on the crack, and make sure Harker doesn’t get trapped upstairs.*

#### Turn 161 **[GAME]**

Your grip over the cracked salt turns firm enough to hurt. The crust doesn’t fully give, but it grinds under your palm—granular, unstable. Jory’s breath stutters as you half-carry, half-slide him down onto the first step.

His boot finds the edge. His braced leg won’t bend properly, so he has to come down stiff, like lowering a plank. He mutters, “I’m— I’m with you,” and keeps his eyes on your face like you asked, blinking too hard.

Behind your hand, the dampness presses again. Not flowing—*seeking*. The linen stays in place, but the salt’s hairline crack widens a fraction.

Tamsin, already three steps down, shifts to the side to make room. She takes the lantern higher, angling it so the light throws across the stairwell and the cellar floor. “There’s a worktable,” she says, scanning. “And crates—two, maybe three. Looks like storage.”

You call up to Harker. He snatches a kitchen knife—short, heavy—and then grabs the pantry door with his free hand.

The kitchen door upstairs slams inward a palm’s width with a splintering *pop*. The sideboard jerks. A thin, pale shape—like a long wet finger or strip of kelp—slips into the gap and hooks, testing. Harker swears and yanks the pantry door toward him.

The pantry door closes, but not cleanly: it catches on a jar that’s rolled under it and leaves a wedge of space—an inch, maybe two—near the bottom. Harker stamps the jar aside and shoves again until the door thuds shut.

It doesn’t latch.

Something scrapes along the pantry door from the other side—slow, exploratory—then stops as if listening.

Tamsin leans toward the cellar air, nostrils flaring. “Yes,” she says, voice gone tight. “Stronger. Like low tide in a closed room.”

As you guide Jory down toward the second step, the lantern light reveals a dark wet track on the stone below—fresh, not old damp—leading from the far corner of the cellar toward the base of the stairs, as if something has recently been dragged, or has crawled, and left the floor shining.

Above, Harker’s boots shift. “I’m coming,” he calls, quieter now. “Wren—move him. That pantry door won’t hold if it decides to push.”

#### Turn 162 **[PLAYER]**

“Alright—second step, Jory. Good. Keep breathing with me.” I shift his weight carefully, keeping my palm clamped over the cracked salt, and angle us down fast but steady.

“Tamsin—lantern on that wet track, but don’t follow it. Get the crates by the worktable and start stacking them at the foot of the stairs—leave a gap for Harker, then close it.” 

I call up, sharper, “Harker, come now—don’t wait for it to choose. Slide down and kick the hatch shut after you if you can.”

*Agent reasoning: The salt seal is failing and something is already in the house; we need distance from the stairs and a barricade while keeping Jory calm. The wet track suggests something in the cellar too, so I’ll avoid it and get us onto higher ground near the worktable/crates, then help Harker down quickly.*

#### Turn 163 **[GAME]**

Jory gets his braced leg down onto the second step with a strangled sound, but he does it. You keep him moving—fast enough to matter, slow enough not to spill him. His fingers clamp around your sleeve so hard you’ll have crescent bruises later.

Under your palm, the cracked salt finally gives a little: a soft *crunch* and a faint warmth of fresh wetness that seeps into the linen. The “seeking” pressure stops for half a beat—then resumes, more insistent, as if it’s found the weak seam.

Tamsin swings the lantern beam toward the wet track. The light catches it like oil: a glossy line that isn’t just water—there are tiny dark flecks in it, like silt or ground pepper. She swallows, then moves—quick, practical. She drags the nearest crate from under the worktable, then a second. Wood scrapes harshly on stone.

“Two crates,” she reports, breathless. “There’s a third wedged—give me a second.”

Upstairs, your sharper call lands.

Harker doesn’t argue. You hear his boots thud across the pantry floor, then the scrape of him turning and committing to the hatch. He drops feet-first, one hand on the frame, knife clenched in the other.

At that exact moment, something hits the pantry door from the kitchen side—not a shoulder-check, but a *hook-and-pull*. The door bows inward and the latch finally gives with a flat *clack*. A cold seam of air knifes down the stairwell.

Harker lands hard on the third step, boots skidding on damp stone. He catches himself with his free hand, knife up, eyes wide.

Above him, through the open pantry doorway, you see it clearly for the first time in the lantern-spill: a thin, pale length—like kelp made of tendon—snaking low across the pantry floor. It’s not a person. It moves with deliberate, jointless patience, and where it touches wood, the surface darkens as if soaked.

It probes the hatch opening, tasting the air.

Harker twists and kicks upward. The hatch swings, but it doesn’t seal—something catches it from above, resisting with a steady pull. The iron ring rattles violently.

“Something’s holding it,” Harker snaps, bracing his shoulder into the stairwell wall. “Wren—down. Now.”

Tamsin shoves the two crates into place at the foot of the stairs, leaving a narrow gap. “Gap for Harker!” she calls, then reaches for the third crate—hands shaking, but moving.

#### Turn 164 **[PLAYER]**

I haul Jory down the last steps as gently as I can and steer him behind the crates, then I rip my hand away long enough to fling a fistful of salt up toward the hatch opening. “Harker—cut whatever’s got the ring! Don’t let it anchor!”

I press back onto the wet spot behind Jory’s knee, voice low and shaking. “Stay with me. Tamsin, close that gap the second Harker’s through—no heroics.”

*Agent reasoning: That thing is in the doorway and the hatch won’t shut; my priority is getting Jory off the stairs and helping Harker break whatever’s holding the hatch, then barricade immediately—my salt is failing and I’m scared it’s tracking us.*

#### Turn 165 **[GAME]**

You get Jory down the last steps in a careful, ugly slide—his brace knocks stone twice, but he doesn’t fall. You tuck him behind the half-stacked crates where the worktable and shelves break line of sight from the stairs.

The moment you lift your hand from the back of his knee, the linen there darkens fast—wet spreading in a thumbprint shape. The skin beneath looks puckered, as if it’s been held under saltwater too long. Jory’s jaw clenches; he makes a thin sound through his teeth but stays with you.

You snatch a fistful of loose salt from the crust and fling it up toward the hatch.

The salt hits the pale, kelp-like length at the opening and *hisses*—not loud, but sharp, like fat on a pan. The thing recoils a few inches, twitching, and the air fills with a sudden iodine sting. For a heartbeat, the pull on the hatch ring weakens.

“Harker—now!” you bark.

Harker doesn’t hesitate. He lunges up two steps, arm extended, and slashes at what’s holding the ring. The knife catches—*cuts*—and a pale strip snaps back like a severed tendon. Dark brine spatters the hatch frame and Harker’s sleeve.

The hatch drops halfway… then jerks again, yanked from above by a second line you didn’t see—thinner, almost transparent in the lantern light. It tightens around the iron ring with a wet squeal.

Harker’s face goes tight with panic he refuses to show. “There’s another—” he starts, and the line *pulls*.

He loses his footing. His boots skid on the damp step and he slams down hard on his hip, knife clattering once against stone before he snatches it back.

Tamsin drags the third crate into place with a grunt, eyes locked on Harker. She holds it poised, ready to shove.

The pale thing at the hatch doesn’t come down yet. Instead, it threads farther into the stairwell—testing the air, then dipping toward the brine-wet track on the cellar floor as if it recognizes it. Where it passes, the lantern flame gutters and leans blue for a second.

Jory grabs your wrist suddenly, nails biting. “It’s—following the wet,” he whispers, eyes huge. “Wren… it likes the trail.”

Harker scrambles backward down the steps toward the gap, breathing hard. “Close it the second I’m through,” he snaps at Tamsin—then, to you, “Salt buys seconds. Not minutes.”

#### Turn 166 **[PLAYER]**

“Harker—move, now!” I grab Jory’s sleeve and press it hard to the back of his knee, trying to blot the wet, then hiss to Tamsin, “Shove the crate as soon as he’s through—pin it.”

As Harker drops into the gap, I scatter a thick line of salt across the wet track on the cellar floor, sweeping it wider with my boot to break the shine. “No more trail,” I mutter, then to Jory, softer, “Hold still—let me pack it again.”

*Agent reasoning: The creature is tracking moisture; Jory’s wound and the wet track are lures. I need Harker down and the barricade closed, then disrupt the trail with salt and get Jory’s leg re-crusted while keeping everyone calm.*

#### Turn 167 **[GAME]**

Harker moves—fast, ugly, committed. He half-falls through the gap between the crates and the stair, boots scraping, shoulder twisting so he doesn’t snag. The instant his hips clear, Tamsin drives the third crate in with all her weight.

Wood slams wood. The gap vanishes.

The crate stack shudders, then holds—pinned tight against the stair’s bottom step. Tamsin braces it with her forearms and spits out, “Done. Don’t—don’t make me do that again.”

You mash Jory’s sleeve to the back of his knee. It drinks up brine-dark wetness immediately. The soaked fabric clings like cold seaweed. Jory goes rigid, breath caught high in his chest, but he stays still when you tell him.

On the cellar floor, your salt goes down in a thick, pale arc across the wet track. You sweep it broader with your boot until the shine breaks into dull, gritty patches.

It works—partly.

Where the salt hits, the glossy line *stops spreading* and the air gives that same pan-hiss you heard at the hatch. The wetness doesn’t cross the salt easily. But the track doesn’t vanish; it beads up against the salt like a tide meeting a seawall, gathering into darker, thicker droplets.

Above the crates, something tests the barrier: a pale filament snakes down between two slats, searching for a gap. It touches the salted line and recoils sharply, whipping back out of sight.

Then the hatch ring overhead shrieks—metal on metal—as whatever is up there pulls again. The hatch doesn’t open now, but it *thuds* and *flexes* against its frame, sending dust down like dry grit-snow.

Harker, on your side of the crates, scrambles backward on hands and heels until his back hits the worktable. He holds the knife up, blade trembling. His sleeve is splattered with dark brine that’s already eating the fabric into tiny holes.

“It’s anchored upstairs,” he says, voice tight. “More than one line. And it knows where we are.”

Tamsin keeps one hand on the crates, the other on the lantern. The flame leans blue again for a second as the hatch thuds—then steadies. “We can’t stay under it,” she says. “If the wood gives, it drops right into us.”

Jory swallows hard. “Wren,” he whispers, eyes fixed on your salt line. “It’s pooling. Like it’s learning.”

#### Turn 168 **[PLAYER]**

I swallow hard and force my voice steady. “Then we don’t stay under it—Tamsin, lantern up and forward. Find us another way out. A coal chute, a door, anything.”

I tear a strip from the hem of my shirt and pack it hard against the back of Jory’s knee, then pour a careful pinch of salt around the edges, not on the rawest part. “Bite down on your sleeve if you need to—don’t look at it.”

To Harker, I nod at his ruined sleeve. “Your arm—keep the brine off your skin. Wrap it.” Then I start laying a second, thicker crescent of salt closer to the crates, widening our “no-cross” line. “And if that hatch drops, we run—no stopping to fight it.”

*Agent reasoning: We can’t hold this spot if the hatch gives; salt seems to repel it, so I’ll reinforce barriers and get us moving deeper while tending Jory’s wound. I’ll also check for another exit and keep the group coordinated.*

“Tamsin—lantern up and forward. Find us a door, a chute, anything that isn’t those stairs.”

I tear a strip from my shirt and pack it hard behind Jory’s knee, then dust salt around the edges only. “Bite your sleeve if you have to—don’t look.”

I glance at Harker’s eaten sleeve. “Wrap your arm—keep that brine off your skin,” and I lay a thicker crescent of salt nearer the crates. “If the hatch drops, we run. No heroics.”

*Agent reasoning: The cellar feels like it’s turning into a trap; I need light and an exit, but I can’t abandon Jory’s wound or let Harker’s brine burn him. I’ll delegate: Tamsin scouts with the lantern while I reinforce the salt barrier and stabilize Jory, and I’ll push Harker to wrap his arm and stay ready to move.*

#### Turn 171 **[GAME]**

Tamsin lifts the lantern and moves—low, quick steps, keeping the light aimed away from the crate-stack so she doesn’t silhouette you. The cellar opens into a cluttered storage run: shelves of jars, coffin hardware in labeled tins, old mourning cloth folded in oilpaper. She sweeps the lantern beam left.

“Door,” she says—then corrects herself when she gets closer. “Not a door. A… panel.”

It’s a narrow wooden panel set into the stone, waist-high, with an iron pull. The edges are swollen with damp, and someone has painted a thin white line around it—old warding chalk, half dissolved. Tamsin grabs the pull and tugs. It doesn’t budge.

She plants a boot and pulls again. The panel gives a millimeter, then sticks with a wet suction sound.

Behind you, you tear cloth from your shirt and pack it behind Jory’s knee. He bites down hard on his sleeve, eyes squeezed shut. The bleeding slows—more seep than pour now—but the skin around the wound remains waterlogged-looking, as if the brine has soaked into him rather than just the fabric.

You dust salt around the edges. The salt doesn’t burn him, but it *does* fizz faintly where it touches the brine-wet cloth—tiny bubbles, like the wound is exhaling.

Harker yanks his own scarf free and wraps his forearm over the chewed sleeve, tight. “It stings,” he says, voice clipped. “It’s trying to—” He stops, swallowing. “It’s trying to get under.”

You lay your thicker crescent of salt nearer the crates. The pooled brine at the first line beads and presses, but doesn’t cross. It builds into a dark, trembling ridge that reflects the lantern like an eye.

Then the crate-stack *knocks*—a single, heavy impact from above, as if something dropped its weight onto the hatch and slid down onto the crates. Dust sifts. The lantern flame leans blue and stays that way a beat too long.

A thin filament snakes through a crack between the top crate and the wall—higher than before—seeking a path around your salt rather than through it.

Tamsin looks back, breath sharp. “Wren—this panel’s an exit, I think, but it’s swollen shut. I need help or a tool.”

Jory’s voice comes muffled through his sleeve, panicked but controlled. “It’s—going around. Not through.”

The threat is now clear: whatever is above is probing for gaps around the barricade, and the hatch/crates are taking impacts that could eventually shift the stack.

#### Turn 172 **[PLAYER]**

I grab the lantern shelf for balance and hurry to Tamsin, keeping my shoulder between her light and the crates. “Don’t smear the chalk—work the center,” I murmur, then wedge my fingers under the iron pull and lean my weight into a slow, steady pry. 

Over my shoulder I call, “Harker—knife that filament if it shows again, and shove salt into any crack it finds. Jory, stay down and keep pressure—talk to me if you feel it moving.”

*Agent reasoning: The panel is our best exit and the chalk suggests it matters; I’ll help Tamsin force it without breaking the ward, while keeping Jory safe and having Harker deal with the filament/gaps.*

#### Turn 173 **[GAME]**

You get to the chalk-lined panel without flashing the lantern straight back into the cellar. Your shoulder blocks most of the beam, and Tamsin obligingly angles it down at the floor and the panel seam.

“Center. Got it,” she breathes, and keeps her fingers off the chalk ring.

You hook your fingers under the iron pull. The metal is cold enough to bite. You lean—slow, controlled—using the lantern shelf as a brace.

At first, nothing.

Then the panel gives with a thick, wet *schlorp*, like pulling a boot out of mud. The seam opens a finger’s width. Damp air pushes out, smelling of soot, old rain, and something mineral—brick dust. You keep the pressure steady and the gap widens to two fingers… three.

A second consequence comes with it: the chalk line around the panel fractures in one spot as the wood flexes, a hairline break you can’t avoid. The ward isn’t gone, but it’s no longer unbroken.

Tamsin slips her fingertips into the widening seam and helps you pull. The panel swings inward a few inches on stiff hinges, revealing a narrow chute-like passage: brick-lined, steep, and dark, with iron rungs set into one side. It goes up, not down.

“Coal chute,” Tamsin says. “Or an old ash run.”

Behind you, Harker snaps, “There!” His knife hand flashes.

A pale filament threads through the crate crack again—now thicker, like a wet cord. Harker slashes. The blade *does* cut it, but the filament doesn’t bleed; it recoils and the severed end lashes once on the cellar side, spattering a fan of brine across the floorboards.

Where the brine lands, it starts to creep—avoiding your salt crescent, but flowing toward the chalk-lined panel like it’s been given a new scent.

Harker, breathing hard, shoves a pinch of salt into the crate crack with his free hand. The salt hisses and the crack goes still.

Jory calls out hoarsely from the floor, “It’s—cold—” He grits his teeth. “Behind my knee. Like something’s trying to pull the wet deeper.”

The immediate threat is now twofold and concrete: the hatch-and-crate barrier is being probed by brine-filaments, and spilled brine is actively creeping toward your newly opened exit seam, where the warding chalk has a break.

#### Turn 174 **[PLAYER]**

“Tamsin—salt the chalk break. Pack it like grout, right now.” I drop to a knee and drag a thick line of salt in a tight half-circle in front of the panel seam, then grab my sea-glass charm and press it into the fracture in the chalk as a stopgap.  

I look back at Harker, voice sharp. “Keep it off this doorway—if brine reaches the seam, we’re done.” Then I crawl to Jory and slide an arm under his shoulders. “I’m sorry,” I whisper, and try to haul him up toward the chute. “Can you climb rungs, or do we need to tie you and pull?”

*Agent reasoning: The brine is homing on the broken chalk and our only exit; I need to reseal the ward fast and get Jory moving, even if it’s clumsy and painful. Wren would prioritize containment and gentleness, but push through fear to act.*

#### Turn 175 **[GAME]**

Tamsin drops instantly to the panel and pinches salt into the hairline break in the chalk ring, pressing it in with the flat of her thumb like mortar. “Hold—hold—” she mutters, packing until the crack is a white, gritty scar. The salt bites at the damp wood; a faint fizzing starts where moisture seeps.

You drag your own thick half-circle of salt in front of the seam. The line is dense, not a dusting—bright and deliberate. When you press your sea-glass charm into the fractured chalk, it seats with a small *click* against the stone, and for a second the lantern’s blue lean steadies toward normal amber.

The creeping brine reaches the edge of your new salt half-circle and stalls, bunching up into a glossy ridge. It tries once—thin tendrils testing for a weak point—then draws back, as if reconsidering.

Harker takes your warning seriously. He steps between the crates and the panel, knife out, and starts *scraping* salt into any floor crack that points toward the doorway. “On it,” he says. His wrapped arm trembles, but he keeps moving.

You crawl to Jory and slide an arm under his shoulders. He’s heavier than he looks—deadweight from pain and shock. When you haul, he makes a strangled sound and clamps his teeth on his sleeve again.

“I can—” he gasps, then shakes his head hard. “Not… rungs. Not with this leg.”

As you shift him, the brine-wet cloth at his knee drags across the floorboards and leaves a smeared, damp trail behind—thin, but real. The smear immediately begins to creep, not toward your salt line, but *toward you*, as if it recognizes the moving source.

From above the crates, another impact hits—harder. The stack shudders; a tin of coffin nails on a nearby shelf rattles and tips, spilling with a bright scatter.

Tamsin looks over her shoulder, eyes wide. “Wren—if we don’t get him up now, that hatch is coming down. The chute’s narrow—one at a time.”

Clear situation:
- The warded panel is holding *for the moment*; your salt line and sea-glass plug have stopped the brine at the seam.
- Jory cannot climb the iron rungs with his injured leg.
- The crate stack is being struck from above and is starting to shift; another hit could drop it and open a path.
- Jory’s movement is leaving a brine smear that is beginning to “wake” and creep.

“Tamsin—up. Now. Get to the first landing or wherever it opens and brace yourself; tie off a line if you find one.”  

I snatch a length of sacking from the nearest shelf and knot it under Jory’s arms and around his chest like a rough sling, then dust salt over the fresh smear behind his knee. “Jory—look at me. We’re hauling, not climbing. Can you hold on with your hands?”  

I thrust the sling’s end toward Harker. “Help me drag him to the chute—then you climb after me. And keep that knife ready; if the crates shift, we don’t stop.”

*Agent reasoning: Jory can’t climb, and the brine is tracking him—if we hesitate, we lose the exit. I’ll send Tamsin up first to anchor a pull, then improvise a harness from my torn shirt and whatever rope/sacking is nearby, even if it’s clumsy.*

I shove the sling’s end toward Harker. “Drag with me—straight to the chute. You climb after I get him started, and keep that knife ready. If the crates shift, we don’t stop.”

*Agent reasoning: The chute is our only clean exit and Jory can’t climb; Tamsin is the best choice to go first and anchor us. I’m scared the brine will follow his smear, so I need salt control while we move fast, and I need Harker’s strength and knife arm to get Jory to the rungs.*

I shove the sling’s end into Harker’s grip. “Pull with me—straight to the chute. Knife in your other hand; if the crates shift, we don’t stop.”

*Agent reasoning: The last thing I did was organize the escape—Tamsin up first, then haul Jory with a sling while Harker guards. The immediate danger is the crate stack/hatch shifting and brine tracking our movement, so I need to move fast, keep the seam protected with salt, and get Jory into the chute without letting the smear spread.*

I shove the sling’s end into Harker’s grip. “Pull with me—straight to the chute. Knife in your other hand; if the crates shift, we don’t stop.”

*Agent reasoning: Tamsin needs to get above and secure a tie-off while Harker and I move Jory immediately; the brine smear has to be salted and we can’t pause if the crates collapse.*

#### Turn 183 **[GAME]**

Tamsin doesn’t argue. She grabs the rungs with both hands and goes up fast, boots scraping wood. The ladder flexes with each step. Above, you hear her breath catch as she finds an opening—then her voice, thin but steady.

“Landing—yes. It’s a service lip, maybe two feet deep. There’s a ring-bolt set into a beam—rusted but it’s *there*.”

Below, you cinch the sacking tight under Jory’s arms. He makes a strangled sound, then forces his fingers to curl around the sling and his own shirtfront like he’s afraid his hands will forget how. His eyes fix on you; he nods once, sharp and obedient.

When you grind salt into the wet smear at his knee, it reacts immediately: the sheen dulls from slick-black to a crusted gray, like something drying too fast. A sharp brine-stink rises. Jory hisses through his teeth, then his leg stops twitching. Not healed—just… stilled.

Harker takes the sling end in his left hand and keeps the knife up in his right, blade angled toward the shadowed stacks. “On three,” he says, and actually means it.

You both haul.

Jory’s body slides over the boards toward the chute-mouth—an angled gap between crates where the floor drops away. The first pull goes clean. The second pull jerks hard as the sacking bites under his ribs; Jory’s hands clamp tighter, knuckles whitening.

Then a crate above you shifts—wood groaning, nails complaining. Dust sifts down in a steady sprinkle. Harker freezes for half a heartbeat, knife lifting higher.

From inside the dark between the crates comes a soft, wet *click-click*, like a tongue against teeth—too rhythmic to be settling timber.

Tamsin, from above: “Hurry. The ring-bolt’ll take a line but the beam’s… Wren, it’s *soft*. Like it’s been soaked.”

You have Jory started toward the chute, but the stacks are moving, and something in the gaps is awake and tracking the sound of you dragging him.

“Harker—don’t look for it. Just cut whatever comes out.” I scoop a fistful of salt and fling it hard into the gap where the click-click is coming from, then immediately haul again, dragging Jory the last stretch to the chute-mouth.

“Tamsin—run the line through the ring-bolt anyway, then around anything *metal* you can find up there—pipe, rail, bracket—don’t trust the beam!” I lean in close to Jory, voice tight. “Hands only. When I say, you slide—don’t fight it.”

I brace my boots, feed the sling forward, and start easing Jory into the chute while keeping my free hand ready to grab my sea-glass charm if the brine surges.

*Agent reasoning: The sound in the crates is too close; getting Jory into the chute is priority, but we need a quick deterrent and a secure haul point upstairs despite the soft beam. I’ll keep moving, use salt as a thrown barrier, and have Tamsin rig the ring-bolt while Harker guards.*

I lean close to Jory, steadying his chin with two fingers. “Hands only. When I say, you slide—don’t fight it.” Then I brace my boots and start easing him into the chute by the sling, free hand hovering over my sea-glass charm.

*Agent reasoning: The clicking in the crates is too close—salt might buy us a second, but Jory needs to go down the chute now. I don’t trust that beam, so I’ll push Tamsin to anchor to metal while I control Jory’s descent and keep my charm ready if the brine lashes out.*

#### Turn 187 **[GAME]**

Harker keeps his gaze locked on the chute-mouth and the shifting stacks, jaw clenched. “Forward,” he echoes, like it’s a vow, and plants his feet wider—knife up, ready to slash without looking for a target.

Your salt hits the gap with a hard scatter. For an instant the click-click stops.

Then something recoils inside the dark with a wet, angry *scrape*, like skin dragged over wood. The salt you threw doesn’t just fall—some of it *sticks* in midair to a thin, clear strand you couldn’t see before. The strand snaps back into the gap, pulling grains with it.

A pale shape noses out between two crates: not a whole creature, more like a jointed feeler—translucent, knuckled, and slick—tasting the air.

Harker doesn’t hesitate. He slashes once, clean and brutal.

The blade bites; the feeler spasms and retreats, leaving a smear on the crate edge that steams faintly where your salt dust clings. The click-click returns, faster now, agitated—still inside, still close.

You haul Jory the last stretch. His hips bump the chute-mouth; he sucks in a breath and clamps his hands to the sling as instructed. He’s shaking, but he’s following you.

Above, Tamsin threads the line through the ring-bolt anyway. You hear metal-on-rope rasp, then her boots skitter as she moves. “There’s a railing—old iron!” she calls, and you hear the line wrap with quick, practiced turns. “I’ve got it on metal—twice—stand by!”

You brace your boots and start easing Jory into the chute. The angle takes him immediately—his weight pulls, the sling goes taut, and for a moment the line threatens to run too fast.

Tamsin locks it off up top with a sharp jerk. The rope bites and holds. Jory drops a foot, then stops, suspended and sliding in controlled inches.

But the crates behind you shift again—this time not just settling. The gap widens as if something is pushing from within. A second feeler presses out, then a third, probing toward the rope and your ankles.

Harker steps into it, knife flashing again, trying to keep them from getting purchase. “Get him DOWN,” he snaps, voice tight with strain, as the slick strands start to web between crate corners—thin lines catching dust, salt, and light.

I grab a fresh handful of salt and scrub it hard into the nearest webbing by my boots, then fling the rest in a wide arc at the rope and the feelers. “Tamsin—LOWER, steady! Don’t stop for anything!”  

I keep one hand on the sling, feeding Jory down in quick controlled bursts. “Jory—now. Slide. Keep your hands, don’t kick—don’t look back.”  

To Harker, tight and urgent: “Cut the strands, not the feelers—keep them off the rope!”

*Agent reasoning: Jory needs to get down fast; the webbing threatens the rope and our legs. Salt worked, and I have sea-glass charms—I'll use salt to foul the strands, keep low and controlled, and coordinate with Tamsin and Harker.*

#### Turn 189 **[GAME]**

Your salt grinds into the nearest webbing like sand into spit. The clear strand near your boot goes opaque-white, tightens, then *shrivels* with a faint hiss—curling away from your sole as if burned. Where you fling the rest, the air briefly fills with bright grains; several stick to the rope and to the probing feelers, outlining them in ugly detail.

The feelers jerk back from the salted rope, twitching as if shocked. But the webbing isn’t all in one place—new strands are already being laid from the gap to the crate corners, faster than before, trying to bridge around the salted patches.

“Tamsin—LOWER, steady!” you call.

“Lowering!” she shouts back, and the rope starts moving again—controlled but quicker. The line slides over iron with a strained, gritty rasp.

You keep one hand on the sling and feed Jory down in short bursts. He obeys—hands only, no kicking—teeth clenched so hard his jaw trembles. He drops another few feet, then another; the chute swallows him until you only see his shoulders and the sling disappearing into darkness below.

Harker takes your cue and starts cutting *strands*, not stabbing at what’s attached to them. His knife snaps through two lines in quick succession. Each cut makes the webbing recoil like a plucked wire—then whip back, trying to reattach. One strand flicks across Harker’s forearm; he swears and yanks away, sleeve instantly damp where it touched.

Then the threat shifts: a thicker, braided-looking line—still nearly invisible—lashes toward the rope itself, aiming to snag it above your salted section.

Harker lunges and hacks at it. He severs it on the second strike, but the moment it parts, the cut end *spits* a fine mist that beads on the nearest crate and smokes faintly where your salt dust lies.

Up top, Tamsin yelps. The rope jerks—hard—like something tugged it from below or the side. “Something just hit the line!” she cries. “I’m holding—Wren, I’m HOLDING—”

Jory drops a sudden extra foot with the jerk and lets out a strangled gasp, but his hands stay on the sling.

You are seconds from getting him fully down, but the webbing is now actively targeting the rope, and the line has already been struck once.

#### Turn 190 **[PLAYER]**

I rip my salt pouch open and cake the rope where it runs past me, palms stinging as I grind the crystals in. “Tamsin—DROP HIM THE LAST BIT, NOW—then LOCK IT OFF!”

I lean into the chute and shout after Jory, voice fierce with panic. “LET GO WHEN YOU HIT BOTTOM—ROLL AWAY!”

To Harker, I grab his sleeve for half a heartbeat and point with my chin at the gap. “Keep them busy—if the rope jerks again, cut it free above the web, understood?”

*Agent reasoning: The line’s the lifeline—if it gets snagged or cut, Jory dies. Salt seems to repel/burn the strands, so I should armor the rope and get Jory fully out of reach fast, even if it risks friction or burns.*

#### Turn 191 **[GAME]**

You tear the salt pouch open; crystals spill like broken teeth. You mash them into the rope where it passes your hands. The fibers drink the grit. Your palms burn—raw where the salt grinds into small cuts—but the rope turns harsh and white with it.

A thin, clear strand snaps toward the line again—hits the salted section—and recoils instantly, curling back as if it touched a hot pan. For the first time since the webbing started, the rope has a boundary it can’t cross.

“Tamsin—DROP HIM THE LAST BIT, NOW—then LOCK IT OFF!”

“Doing it!” Tamsin answers, voice high. The rope suddenly runs fast—controlled release, but a real drop. The sling slides through your salted grip; crystals bite your skin as it goes.

You lean into the chute and shout down. “LET GO WHEN YOU HIT BOTTOM—ROLL AWAY!”

Jory’s reply is a hoarse, breathless “—okay—” swallowed by the shaft. A heartbeat later: a dull *thump* from below, then a scraping scuttle as he hits and rolls. You hear him gasp and then move—alive, away from the landing point.

Up here, the webbing surges in frustration. Two feelers press out at once, jointed and slick, trying to lay new lines *around* the salted rope—anchoring to the crate edges, then angling for your boots and Harker’s legs instead.

Harker nods once at your warning—no words—then steps closer to the gap, making himself the nearer target. He slashes strands as they form, keeping them from bridging. One feeler flicks toward his knife hand; he twists his wrist away, blade still cutting, but the tip catches and drags a string of clear slime that steams where it touches salt.

Above, Tamsin locks the rope off hard on the iron railing. You hear the cinch bite—then a metallic *clank* as she braces it.

“Locked!” she shouts.

The immediate danger shifts: the salted rope is holding, Jory is down and moving, but the webbing is now reaching for *you and Harker*—and the gap between crates is widening as something inside pushes, building pressure for a larger emergence.

#### Turn 192 **[PLAYER]**

I snatch up the spilled salt and draw a rough crescent line at our feet between us and the gap, then grab Harker’s elbow. “Back—now. We go on Tamsin’s count, no heroics.”  

I call up, voice sharp: “Tamsin, keep that rope locked—get ready to haul us if the ladder goes. Count us up!”  

To Harker, low and urgent: “You first on the rungs; I’ll salt and follow—if it comes through, I’m not letting it take you.”

*Agent reasoning: Jory’s safe for the moment; now the priority is getting Harker and me out before whatever’s inside fully emerges. Salt buys us seconds, not minutes, so I’ll retreat toward the ladder while keeping a salt barrier and coordinating with Tamsin/Harker.*

#### Turn 193 **[GAME]**

You scoop the spilled salt with both hands and drag it into a rough crescent on the floorboards, a bright, gritty smile between you and the widening gap. Where the line crosses old damp stains, it clumps—but it’s continuous.

The nearest strands reach for it.

They touch the salt and recoil in sharp, twitching pulls. The webbing doesn’t cross the crescent cleanly; it bunches at the edge like a tide hitting shingle, trying to find a thin spot. One feeler probes low, taps the line twice, then withdraws fast, leaving a wet bead that smokes faintly against the crystals.

You clamp a hand on Harker’s elbow. “Back—now.”

Harker goes with you immediately—no argument, no pride—just a hard nod. He keeps his knife up, but he’s moving backward in measured steps, not giving the feelers a clean shot at his calves.

Up above, you call, “Tamsin—keep that rope locked—get ready to haul us if the ladder goes. Count us up!”

Tamsin leans over the hatch edge, hair blown across her face by the draft. “Rope’s locked!” she yells, then swallows and forces her voice steady. “On my count—Harker first. Three… two… ONE—MOVE!”

Harker pivots and grabs the ladder rungs. The wood creaks under his weight; the ladder’s top shudders as if the whole hatch frame is old and tired of being trusted. He starts up fast, boots thudding rung to rung.

You hold position at the crescent, scattering what salt you have left along the thinnest clumped patches with your heel, trying to keep the line unbroken while Harker climbs.

Behind the crates, something *larger* shifts.

The gap opens another inch with a splintering crack. A thicker limb—still translucent, but with visible knuckles and tendon-like cords—pushes out and *presses* against the salt crescent without crossing it, testing it like a door. The pressure makes the salt line tremble; crystals skitter outward.

Harker is halfway up when the limb changes tactics: it hooks around the crate edge above the salt and yanks. The crate scrapes forward, wood screaming on wood, trying to drag itself—and the webbing anchor points—closer to you, to bypass the salt arc.

Tamsin’s voice snaps down again, urgent now. “Wren—MOVE! The ladder’s shaking—MOVE NOW!”

#### Turn 194 **[PLAYER]**

I lunge backward toward the ladder, kicking a last scatter of salt into the sliding crate’s path as I go. “Tamsin—HAUL when I grab on!” I grab the lowest rung with both hands and climb hard after Harker, breath ragged. “Harker—don’t you dare look back—just climb!”

*Agent reasoning: The salt line won’t hold if the crates shift around it; staying to “maintain” it will get me grabbed. I need to retreat to the ladder immediately and use whatever salt I have left to buy seconds, trusting Harker and Tamsin to get me out.*

#### Turn 195 **[GAME]**

You fling yourself back toward the ladder, heel snapping through the salt crescent as you go. The last scatter of crystals skids into the crate’s path—some bounce under its leading edge.

The crate hits the salt and *stutters*, like a wheel catching on a curb. It doesn’t stop, but it slows just long enough for you to get your hands on the lowest rung.

“Tamsin—HAUL when I grab on!”

“I’VE GOT YOU—” Tamsin barks, and the rope above gives a sharp, purposeful tug—not on the ladder, but on the line she’s braced to use if the hatch frame tears. You feel the whole opening tense as she shifts her weight into a safer stance.

You climb hard. Your palms—already stung raw—burn against the rung edges. Behind you, the crate scrapes again, louder: it’s being pulled with steady strength now, not a random shove. The salt you kicked is smearing into wet paste under the wood.

“Harker—don’t you dare look back—just climb!”

Harker doesn’t look. He climbs faster, shoulders hunched, jaw set, boots hammering rungs. “I’m moving,” he spits, voice tight.

Halfway up, the ladder *jerks* sideways. Not a wobble—a real lateral tug from below, as if something has latched onto one of the ladder’s feet or the hatch frame. The rung in your hands snaps your arms straight; your stomach drops.

Tamsin swears above. “IT’S ON THE LADDER—WREN, UP—UP—UP!”

You scramble, getting another rung, then another. The wood creaks in a rising, panicked pitch. A slick, translucent hand—too many joints, too long—slides into view at the edge of the hatch below, feeling for the ladder’s side rail.

It doesn’t cross salt now; it doesn’t need to. It’s using the ladder itself.

Harker reaches the top and throws an elbow over the lip, hauling himself onto the upper floorboards. Tamsin grabs his collar and yanks him clear, then immediately leans down for you, one hand on the rope, the other reaching.

The ladder gives a violent shudder as the thing below tightens its grip. One of the ladder’s lower feet lifts off the floor a fraction—then slams back down—telegraphing that the next pull could rip it free.

You are still several rungs from the top. The thing’s hand is now on the ladder rail beneath you, climbing after you by *pulling the ladder toward itself*, not by climbing normally.

#### Turn 196 **[PLAYER]**

I hook one boot around a rung to steady myself, then yank my sea-glass charm free and grind it hard along the ladder rail where that slick hand is gripping, smearing any salt-crust and my own blood into the wood. “Tamsin—TAKE MY WRIST, NOW!” I thrust my arm up and scramble the last rungs, snarling down at the hand, “Let go—let go—let go.”

*Agent reasoning: The thing is using the ladder, so I need to deny it purchase fast; I’m close enough to reach Tamsin, and salt is my best deterrent even if it hurts.*

#### Turn 198 **[PLAYER]**

I hook my boot hard around the rung to brace, rip my sea-glass charm free, and grind it viciously along the rail where that slick hand grips—smearing salt-crust and blood into the wood. “Tamsin—take my wrist, NOW!” I shoot my arm up and scramble the last rungs, teeth bared down at the hand. “Let go—let go—let go.”

*Agent reasoning: The ladder’s about to be torn out and Tamsin’s within reach; I’ll try to burn or slick the grip with salt and then get hauled up without looking back.*

#### Turn 200 **[PLAYER]**

I hook my boot hard around the rung to brace, rip my sea-glass charm free, and grind it down the rail where that slick hand grips, smearing salt-crust and my own blood into the wood. “Tamsin—take my wrist, NOW!” I shoot my arm up and scramble the last rungs, snarling down at the hand, “Let go—let go—let go.”

*Agent reasoning: The hand is using the ladder itself; salt has worked so far, and my sea-glass charm is the only thing I can sacrifice to make a quick barrier while I get pulled out. I need Tamsin’s grip before the ladder tears loose.*

#### Turn 201 **[GAME]**

Your boot hooks the rung and holds—just barely—while the ladder bucks under the sideways pull. The rail is slick with condensation and something colder than water.

You tear the sea-glass charm free. The cord snaps against your fingers. When you grind the glass down the rail, it squeals like a knife on stone.

The effect is immediate and ugly: the slick hand *seizes*—its long fingers spasming as the sea-glass scrapes across them. Where the glass passes, the translucent skin clouds, turning milky, and a thin, briny film smokes off it as if the touch burns. The hand loosens its grip for a heartbeat.

But it doesn’t retreat. It *re-grips lower*, trying to yank the whole ladder again, and the rail you just scraped comes away with a smear of your blood and salt paste—streaks that glow faintly for half a second, then dull.

“Tamsin—take my wrist, NOW!”

Tamsin drops flat on her belly at the hatch lip, boots braced, one hand locked around the rope as an anchor. “GIVE IT—” she barks, and clamps her other hand around your wrist with a painful, iron grip. Her fingers are cold from the rope, but steady.

Harker, already on the boards, scrambles to her side and grabs your forearm just above her hand. “Up—UP—don’t slip—”

Between them they haul. Your hooked boot tears free as you scramble the last rungs, and your lantern swings wildly, throwing blue-tinged shadows across the hatch frame.

Below, the slick hand lashes upward again—too fast—catching your ankle for a split second. Its touch is like plunging into icy brine. Then your heel clears the lip and the hand loses purchase, raking the ladder rail with nails that leave pale grooves in the wood.

You’re dragged onto the upper floorboards on your side, chest heaving. Tamsin doesn’t let go of your wrist; she yanks you another foot back from the hatch.

The ladder *jerks* once more, hard enough that the hatch frame creaks and spits dust. The slick hand clings to the rail below, and something heavier than a hand shifts in the dark—pulling, testing.

Tamsin spits down into the opening. “Harker—GET SOMETHING OVER IT. NOW.”

Harker bolts, limping, toward the nearest furniture, already grabbing for anything he can drag.

Your ankle throbs with cold pain where it was grabbed, and the ladder continues to shudder under the thing’s weight—still trying to come up.

#### Turn 202 **[PLAYER]**

I suck in a sharp breath and grab my ankle with one hand, then force myself upright on my elbow. “Salt—now—circle the hatch, heavy and thick; it hates it.”  

I fumble for my pouch and fling a spill of salt straight onto the hatch lip and down the ladder rail, then reach for Tamsin’s forearm. “You okay? Don’t let go of that rope—Harker, drag something solid over and we nail it if we can.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m hurt and shaken, but we can’t let it gain the upper floor—my restoration instincts go to sealing and weighting, and I trust Tamsin’s grip while I focus on stopping the climb.*

#### Turn 203 **[GAME]**

Your fingers go for a pouch that isn’t there.

You come up with only linen and the rough edge of your own pocket seam—no comforting weight of salt, no grit to scatter. For a half-second you just stare at your empty hand, then the hatch gives a violent *thunk* as the ladder is yanked from below and the lie of safety snaps back into motion.

Tamsin’s eyes flick to your hand, understanding landing hard. “You don’t have it,” she says through her teeth. She keeps one fist knotted in the rope and reaches her free hand to squeeze your forearm once—quick, a check-in, not comfort. “I’m fine. Breathe.”

Below, the slick hand claws up again, knuckles whitening to that milky haze where the sea-glass scraped it. It drags itself to the hatch lip, fingers splaying on the threshold. The wood hisses faintly where your blood-and-salt smear was, as if the grain resents being touched.

Harker returns hauling the chair—your chair—one leg already wobbly from the earlier brace. He rams it toward the opening, but the ladder bucks again and the chair skitters sideways with a screech.

“Hold it—Harker, *hold it!*” Tamsin snaps, shifting her weight to keep the rope taut. The rope bites into her palm; you can see it redden.

The hand *hooks* the hatch frame, and something unseen pulls behind it—enough force that the hatch rim flexes. A wet, dragging sound follows, like cloth soaked through and wrung out.

You reach for Tamsin’s forearm; her sleeve is damp with sweat and rope-water. “Don’t let go,” you say—and she doesn’t.

Harker plants his foot, shoves the chair’s seat down over the opening. The slick fingers slap against the underside and *push back*, lifting the chair a fraction before Harker throws his weight onto it.

“There—there!” he gasps. “What now—what now?”

The chair holds for the moment, but it’s trembling in small, steady pulses from below—testing, patient. Your ankle still aches with cold, and where it was grabbed, the skin is already paling as if frostbitten.

#### Turn 204 **[PLAYER]**

I swallow hard and nod at Tamsin’s bitten palm. “Wrap the rope—twice—around something solid before it skins you; I need you functional.” Then I drag myself closer on my good knee and press my sea-glass charm flat against the floorboards at the hatch edge, scraping a rough line along the seam. “Harker, keep your weight on that chair—don’t let it breathe. Is there a nail tin, a pry bar, anything iron?”

*Agent reasoning: I’m rattled realizing I’m out of salt, but I can still use what I know—glass, iron, weight, and buying time. I also don’t want Tamsin hurt by that rope, and Harker needs clear, simple orders.*

#### Turn 205 **[GAME]**

Tamsin grits her teeth and does exactly what you say—she lunges one-handed for the nearest solid anchor: the thick leg of the worktable. She loops the rope around it once, then twice, fast and practiced. The tension shifts off her palm; the rope still pulls, but now it’s the table that takes the bite. She shakes her hand once, flexing blood back into her fingers. “Still functional,” she says, voice tight.

You drag closer on your good knee. The chair over the hatch judders under Harker’s weight in small, rhythmic lifts—like something below is pressing up, then easing off, learning the load.

You press the sea-glass charm flat to the boards and scrape a line along the hatch seam. The glass catches on old varnish, then bites into raw wood with a harsh, chalky squeal. Where the sea-glass passes, the seam darkens with a wet-looking sheen and a faint salt-fog beads up as if the wood is sweating.

Under the chair, the pressure *stutters*—one push falters mid-rise, as if the thing below flinched from the seam you marked. A thin, angry hiss leaks up through the crack, brine-sour and cold.

Harker keeps his weight planted, knuckles white on the chair back. “It’s—pushing—” he pants. “I can feel it—like a shoulder—like—”

“Anything iron?” you demand.

Harker jerks his chin toward the pantry hatch area. “Nail tin—by the swollen panel—Jory kept it there—” He swallows as the chair lifts a finger’s width and drops again. “Pry bar—might be in the cellar stair cubby—if it didn’t… if it didn’t move.”

Tamsin, now anchored to the table, leans low and peers at the seam you scored. “It doesn’t like that,” she says. Then her eyes snap to your ankle—pale, blotched where it was grabbed. “Wren. That’s not just cold. That’s *taking*.”

Below, the slick hand scrapes along the underside of the chair—nails dragging—testing for a gap. The chair shifts a fraction toward the unmarked side of the seam, trying to find the path of least resistance. Harker throws his shoulder into it to keep it centered, but he’s shaking.

The threat is still directly under you, pressing, probing—held back only by Harker’s weight, the rope’s tension, and the thin, salt-wet line you’ve just carved.

#### Turn 206 **[PLAYER]**

I clamp my hand over my ankle and breathe through the sting. “Don’t—don’t look at it yet,” I mutter to Tamsin, then meet her eyes. “If it’s taking, we stop it by starving it—iron and a seal.”

I shove myself toward the pantry on my good knee, keeping low, and call back, “Harker, keep it centered on the seam I scored—if it shifts to the bare side, it’ll find the gap.” I reach for the swollen panel where Jory kept the nail tin, yanking it open hard enough to crack my fingernail. “Tamsin—when I get nails, you hammer. I’ll keep the glass on the seam.”

*Agent reasoning: The chair won’t hold forever; we need iron fast and a better seal. I’m worried about my ankle “being taken,” but Tamsin and Harker need direction and I can still move.*

#### Turn 207 **[GAME]**

You keep low and move on your good knee; every shift makes your grabbed ankle flare with a deep, briny sting, like the ache comes from inside the joint.

“Harker—centered!” you call.

“I’m—trying!” Harker grunts, chest over the chair. The chair skates a thumb’s width, then he wrenches it back so its legs straddle the scored seam. The pressure from below answers with a hard upward shove that nearly unseats him. He yelps and drops his full weight down again. “It’s strong, Wren—”

Tamsin doesn’t argue about your ankle, but she doesn’t stop watching you either. She keeps the rope wrapped to the table leg, then crawls closer to the hatch on her elbows, ready hands hovering like she’s waiting to catch something that falls.

You reach the swollen panel by the pantry hatch and yank. The wood resists—then gives with a wet crack. Your fingernail splits, sharp pain flashing white. A bead of blood immediately wells up.

The smell changes at once: the air near the hatch seems to *notice* fresh blood. The chair over the opening trembles harder, and a thin, eager scraping starts underneath it—nails moving faster, as if the thing has been roused.

Inside the swollen panel’s cavity: not a neat nail tin.

There’s a small rusted tin, yes—but it’s been shoved aside, half-crushed, lid bent open and mostly empty. A few bent nails rattle inside like teeth.

Behind it, screwed to the backboard of the cavity, is a thin brass plaque—newer screws, clean bites in old wood—covering something older. One corner has been lifted by salt-swollen grain, just enough to show what’s beneath: an older dedication plate, stamped with the Ashford & Daughters transfer-sigil (the little mark you grew up seeing on “don’t ask” parcels) and a date that punches the air out of your lungs.

The week your mother vanished.

Tamsin sees your face change. “Wren—what did you find?”

At the hatch, Harker’s voice breaks. “It’s—getting a finger under—!”

One chair leg lifts a fraction as something slick wedges from below, searching for the bare side of the seam.

#### Turn 208 **[PLAYER]**

I snatch the rusted tin and slam the panel shut with my shoulder, then crawl back toward the hatch, clenching my bleeding finger in my fist. “Later,” I hiss to Tamsin, eyes flicking once to the plaque before I force them away—“I found something about my mother, but later.”

I shove the tin at Tamsin. “Take these—bend them straight if you have to—pin the chair legs to the boards and nail across the hatch seam.” Then I press the sea-glass charm hard to the *bare* side where it’s trying to wedge in, scraping a fresh rough line. “Harker, don’t you move—Tamsin, now. Hammer like it’s a coffin lid.”

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is about to give and my blood is making it worse; I need to get nails to Tamsin fast and reinforce the seal with the sea-glass line, even if I don’t have answers about the plaque yet.*

#### Turn 209 **[GAME]**

You slam the swollen panel shut with your shoulder. The warped wood catches, then thumps into place. Your split nail smears a dark crescent on the edge as you crawl away, fist clamped tight around the bleeding finger.

“Later,” you hiss.

Tamsin’s eyes flick toward the pantry for a heartbeat—she clearly wants to look—but she swallows it down and turns back to the hatch. “Later,” she agrees, and takes the tin from you.

At the hatch, the chair has shifted a breath toward the unscored side. Harker is half-sliding, boots scrabbling for purchase on the boards. “It’s under—” he gasps, voice going thin.

You jam the sea-glass charm to the bare side and scrape hard. The glass shrieks against wood, carving a rough, salt-wet line. The moment the line closes the gap, the pressure from below *stops*—not gone, but checked, like a shoulder hitting a locked door. A hiss leaks up through the seam, sharper than before, and something slick slaps the underside of the chair in irritation.

Tamsin flips the tin open. “These are—Wren, these are bent to hell.”

“Use them,” you snap.

She grabs two nails, forces them straighter against the floor with the heel of her hand—crude, but enough to bite. Then she looks up, jaw tight. “Hammer?”

No hammer is in her hands. She snatches the nearest heavy thing: the chair slat brace you’d been using earlier, its end wrapped in splintered cloth. “This’ll have to do.”

Harker grunts as the chair bucks again. “Hurry—!”

Tamsin crawls in, keeping low, and drives the first nail down beside a chair leg with the brace. The nail squeals, then punches into old plank with a dull *chock*. She hits it again—harder. The nail bends slightly, but it pins the chair leg enough that it can’t skate sideways.

Under the chair, the thing responds immediately: a hard upward shove that lifts the chair a fraction. The pinned leg holds; the unpinned side jolts, and the chair twists. Harker nearly spills, catching himself with a palm on the floor.

Then the smell hits—brine and iron—because your clenched fist has reopened. A thin, wet *sniffing* sound comes through the seam, deliberate, searching.

Tamsin drives a second nail. “One more and we cross the seam,” she says, breath ragged. “Wren—keep that line. Don’t let it find wood it can love.”

Evelyn “Eve” Marlowe grew up in a dockside tenement and learned early that survival in this city comes with a price. Now she works as a nightclub chanteuse and occasional courier for a bootlegging crew, trading secrets for safety under the jaundiced glow of backroom deals. Guarded, razor-witted, and quietly tender beneath the armor, she can’t stop orbiting the married detective who keeps trying—and failing—to save her. Her goal is to buy her brother out of a gang debt and disappear, even if it means betraying the only man she’s ever loved.

#### Turn 9 **[GAME]**

Rain ticks the skylights of **the Velvet Lark** like impatient fingers. It’s **late night**, the hour when the docks go quiet and the streets get loud. Neon from the sign bleeds through the front curtains, and the air behind the stage smells of powder, sweat, and spilled gin. Outside, a siren starts and dies.

You sit at your dressing table with one shoe off, garter loosened, working the stocking down your calf as if you’re only fixing a snag. The mirror bulbs buzz. Your stage lipstick is still perfect, but your hands are steady in the way they were in the tenement—steady because shaking never bought you mercy. The torn **ledger page** stays flat against your skin until you slide it into your palm and read the columns again: dates, amounts, names you’ve heard men whisper about.

A knock comes—two quick taps, one slow—then the door opens without waiting. It’s **Lena**, the cigarette girl, cheeks flushed from running. She doesn’t look at your face; she looks at your hands. “Halden,” she says, and pushes a matchbook onto your table like it’s a tip. Inside, in tight pencil: **RAID. VICE BUREAU. TEN MINUTES. GET OUT. DON’T LET THEM TAKE YOU.** Under it, another line: **They asked about you by name.**

Before you can move, a man you’ve never seen steps into the doorway behind Lena as if he belongs there. Clean coat, no club stamp on his wrist, and a pale key-pin on his lapel—the same marrow-white symbol that marks your page. He sets a small case on the chair and says, calm as a banker, “New papers. New name. One delivery to a chalk-marked basement on Harker Street. Tonight.”

The hallway fills with footsteps and the distant bark of a whistle. You have the page, the warning, and the case in the same room, and every option has a price.

#### Turn 10 **[PLAYER]**

I slide the ledger page back against my skin and stand, slipping my shoe on. “You’ve got brass in the hall and you picked now to go selling miracles?” I tilt my chin at the pale pin. “Who sent you—and what’s in that case that’s worth my neck?”

*Agent reasoning: A raid means I can’t linger, and this stranger with the key-pin reeks of leverage; I need a way out and a name to hang this on, but I can’t tip my whole hand yet.*

#### Turn 11 **[GAME]**

The ledger page disappears back under the stocking against your thigh; the fabric catches for half a second on the torn edge, then lies flat. You get your shoe on just as the hallway noise sharpens—boots, a man’s laugh that doesn’t belong to the Lark, and the metallic jingle of a nightstick against a belt buckle.

The man with the pale key doesn’t flinch. He closes the dressing-room door with two fingers, not latching it—just enough to muffle the hall. Then he takes a step in, keeping his hands where you can see them.

“Miracles don’t come cheap,” he says. His voice is educated, careful about it. “I’m not Vice. I’m not Saints. I’m sent by Mr. Ketteridge’s office.” The name lands like a calling card—Marrow Society money, the kind that buys judges and riverfront blocks.

He nods at the key-pin when you tilt your chin. “That pin is my receipt. It means if I’m found in pieces, someone important asks why.”

“What’s in the case?” you press.

He doesn’t open it. He taps the lid once. “Documents. A birth certificate that doesn’t exist yet, a work card that already has stamps, and a letter of employment with a real company that will swear you’ve been on payroll for six months. Enough to walk through a station house without anyone deciding you’re worth holding.” His eyes flick briefly to your bare thigh before he looks away, like he’s marking where you keep things. “And something else. Sealed. Not for me.”

Lena shifts near the mirror, wringing her hands. “Eve—” she starts, but a hard rap hits the outer door to the backstage corridor, not yours—someone checking rooms.

A male voice barks down the hall: “Vice Bureau—everybody out front! Dressing rooms next!”

The Marrow man lowers his voice. “Harker Street. Basement door with fresh chalk marks—surveyors’ marks. You take the case there. You hand it through. You don’t look inside the sealed packet if you value your eyes.”

Another set of footsteps—closer now—stops right outside your dressing-room door. A shadow cuts under it.

The knob turns once, testing.

#### Turn 12 **[PLAYER]**

I snatch the case and shove it into Lena’s arms for half a breath. “Powder room—now. If anyone asks, you never saw me.” Then I pull her back, take the case again, and hiss to the Marrow man, “Is Detective Halden in on this raid, or is he about to get himself killed trying to play hero?” 

I kill the mirror bulbs, slip to the far wall, and crack the stage-side panel open just enough to squeeze through. “If you want me alive, you’re coming first and you’re quiet.”

*Agent reasoning: Vice is seconds away; I need an exit that doesn’t put Lena in the line of fire. I’ll take the case for now—papers mean leverage—and use the stage/trap or service route, but I want to know if the detective is part of this raid.*

#### Turn 13 **[GAME]**

The case is heavier than it looks—more like paperwork wrapped around something dense. When you shove it into Lena’s arms, she staggers a half-step, eyes wide. She nods hard at “powder room,” but she doesn’t move yet—frozen by the sound of the knob testing again.

You take the case back. The Marrow man watches your hands like he’s counting seconds.

You snap the mirror bulbs off. The room drops into a dim gray, lit only by spill from the hallway. The stage-side panel—an old service hatch in the far wall—gives with a soft crack of dry wood as you ease it open. Cold air and the faint throb of sax and crowd noise seep through.

In the hallway, a fist hits your door—once, impatient.

“Open up,” a man says, close enough that you can hear his breath. “Vice Bureau.”

You hiss at the Marrow man about Halden. He answers without heat, low and quick: “Halden isn’t running this. If he shows his face tonight, it’s to look useful—or to keep a certain file from walking. He’s in danger either way.”

He moves when you order him—quiet, but not graceful. His shoe scuffs the floorboard, a small sound that nonetheless seems enormous in the dark.

The knob turns again, harder this time.

“Last chance,” the voice says.

You slip through the panel first, shoulder scraping the frame. The space beyond is a narrow service run behind the stage flats—painted canvas, ropes, and dust. You can see through a slit between curtains: the club floor is still full, but the mood has shifted—heads turning toward the front, people standing too fast.

Behind you, the Marrow man squeezes for the hatch—

—and at that exact moment the dressing-room door latch snaps with a sharp crack. The door swings inward, flooding the room with hallway light.

A Vice Bureau officer fills the doorway, hat brim low, baton in hand. He takes in the dead bulbs, the open hatch, and Lena by the mirror like she’s been caught mid-prayer.

“There,” he says, and points straight at the panel. “They’re going out the back.”

Boots start running.

You are in the service run with the case. The Marrow man is halfway through the hatch, stuck for a breath as he drags a shoulder free. Lena is still inside the dressing room with Vice staring her down.

```

#### Turn 14 **[PLAYER]**

I lean back through the hatch just enough to be seen and snap, “She’s just the cigarette girl, you dumb ox—she don’t know a thing,” then I grab a fistful of powder from the table and fling it straight at the officer’s face. I yank the Marrow man fully through by his coat and hiss, “Move—now,” and tear down the service run toward the back exit, keeping low behind the flats.

*Agent reasoning: Lena’s about to take the fall because of me; I can’t leave her to Vice. I’ll buy her a second and then run—case in hand—before they flood the service run.*

#### Turn 15 **[GAME]**

You lean back through the hatch into the dressing room light—just enough for the Vice man to see your face and hear you. “She’s just the cigarette girl—” you spit, and the officer’s eyes narrow, recognizing you the way Halden warned: by name, by description, by somebody’s money.

Your hand finds the powder dish by the mirror. You scoop a fistful and fling.

It hits him square across the eyes and nose. He jerks back with a strangled curse, baton clattering against the doorframe as he claws at his face. “God—!” He staggers, blinking hard, tears cutting white tracks through the powder.

Lena uses the half-second like she was born for it—she ducks under his arm and bolts into the hall, skirts up, moving fast and silent.

You hook your fingers in the Marrow man’s coat and haul. He comes through the hatch with a grunt, shoulder scraping wood, and lands wrong on one knee in the service run. He’s up again immediately, teeth clenched, the key-pin catching a sliver of stage light.

Behind you, the officer barks, half-blind: “BACKSTAGE! NOW! SHE’S HERE—EVE MARLOWE!”

Boots answer—two, then three sets—pounding toward the dressing rooms.

You tear down the service run, keeping low behind the flats. Canvas brushes your cheek. A rope swings and taps your shoulder as you pass. The sax on stage keeps wailing, but the crowd noise changes—screams now, chairs scraping, a shouted “Police!”

Ahead: the back exit door at the end of the run—painted black, with a push bar—and a thin line of rain-lit alley seeping under it.

Then a stagehand you don’t recognize steps out from between two flats like he was waiting there, palms up as if to calm you. Saints haircut. Saints eyes. He holds a short iron bar low at his thigh.

“Evenin’, songbird,” he says. “Boss wants his paper back.”

Behind you, the service run fills with the hard clap of running boots and a voice shouting, “STOP!”

You have the Saints man blocking the back exit ten feet ahead, Vice closing from behind, and the Marrow courier at your shoulder trying not to breathe too loud.

#### Turn 16 **[PLAYER]**

I lift the case like I’m offering it and call low, “Tell your boss the paper’s already burned—this is what replaced it,” then I whip the case hard into his chest to buy a heartbeat and shoulder past on his bar side. “Eddie—move!” I snap at the Marrow man, shoving him for the door as I slam the push bar and spill us into the rain-lit alley.

*Agent reasoning: I’m pinned—if I hesitate, Vice catches me; if I fight, I’ll lose time. Saints like leverage, so I’ll bargain with a lie and use the stage chaos to slip past, even if it’s messy.*

#### Turn 17 **[GAME]**

You lift the Marrow case like an offering. The Saints man’s eyes flick to it—greedy, automatic—his iron bar rising a couple inches as he shifts his weight to take or smash, you can’t tell which.

“Tell your boss the paper’s already burned—this is what replaced it,” you murmur.

Then you whip the case into his chest.

It lands with a dull, solid thud—more resistance than folders should have. He grunts, air punched out, boots skidding on dusty boards. The iron bar comes up late, clipping your shoulder as you shoulder past on his bar side. Pain flashes hot down your arm, but nothing breaks; it’s a glancing hit meant to stop you, not kill you.

“Eddie—move!” you snap.

The Marrow courier lunges for the door when you shove him. He fumbles the push bar with both hands like he’s never used a stage exit in his life. It gives, and the door bangs outward.

Rain and alley light spill in. You both tumble out into the wet—cobblestones slick, garbage stink, fog hugging the brick. The door starts to swing back on its spring.

Behind you, the Saints man recovers fast, wheezing. “She’s got the Society box!” he barks, and he’s already reaching inside his coat.

Inside the club, boots hit the service run. A Vice voice shouts, “ALLEY! CUT ‘EM OFF!”

In the alley, a black sedan is idling half a block down with its lamps off—engine ticking soft. The passenger door is already cracked open, like someone expected you. A silhouette inside turns its head toward you.

The Marrow man—Eddie, apparently—grabs your elbow with a sharp, desperate grip. “Not that car,” he hisses, eyes fixed on it. “That’s not ours.”

The backstage door slams open behind you. The Vice officer you blinded bursts out, face smeared white, pistol in hand, blinking through tears.

“You!” he yells, and raises the gun.

The Saints man steps into the doorway behind him with his iron bar—and something small and dark in his other hand now.

You are in the alley in the rain, with Vice aiming, a Saints enforcer armed behind him, and an unknown sedan waiting ahead with an open door.

```json
{"locations_add":["Velvet Lark — back alley"],"inventory_remove":[],"inventory_add":[],"abilities_add":[],"npcs_add":[]}
```

#### Turn 18 **[PLAYER]**

I grab Eddie by the collar and yank him sideways into the deepest shadow by the brick, then I fling the Marrow case down hard to splash and skitter as a distraction. “HALDEN!” I shout into the rain like a prayer and a knife, and I bolt for the sedan’s open door—low, zig-zagging—ready to slam it shut or jump back out the second I see who’s inside.

*Agent reasoning: Eddie’s warning feels true, but a gun pointed at me means I need cover now; the sedan’s the only moving shield, and I can decide whether to get in after I’m not staring down a barrel.*

#### Turn 19 **[GAME]**

You wrench Eddie by the collar and slam him into the brick’s deepest seam of shadow. He stumbles, catches himself, and stays there—hands up, breathing ragged, eyes tracking the gun.

You hurl the Marrow case into the alley.

It hits a puddle and *skips*—hard corners biting water—then skitters toward the middle of the cobbles with a heavy, ugly scrape. The lid pops a finger-width. Something inside flashes pale under the street spill: not papers—something smooth and bone-white.

The Vice officer’s attention snaps to it. “The box!” he barks, and his pistol dips for the fraction you needed.

“HALDEN!” you shout, loud enough to rake the windows.

A shape moves at the far end of the alley—someone behind a rain barrel flinches like they’ve been waiting for that name, but they don’t step out.

You bolt for the sedan, low and cutting side to side.

The Vice officer fires once. The shot cracks off the brick above you, showering grit; the ricochet whines past your ear. He fires again—this one punches into the sedan’s rear quarter with a metallic *thunk*, sparking.

The Saints enforcer in the doorway doesn’t swing the bar—he throws. The small dark thing in his hand arcs and clatters near the case: a compact baton-light or weighted sap, meant to draw eyes—then he lunges for the skittering case instead, greedy and fast.

You reach the sedan’s open door and catch it with your left hand.

Inside: not Halden. A man in a dark coat and driver’s cap, jaw tight, eyes sharp. Marrow Society key-pin on his lapel, but his hands are wrong—ink-stained, not soft. He levels a short pistol from the passenger seat straight at your ribs.

“Get in,” he says. “Now. Or you die in the alley.”

From behind you, Eddie hisses, “Eve—NO—” and the Vice officer is already re-aiming, stepping forward into the rain with murder in his face.

The sedan’s engine revs, ready to jump the moment weight hits the seat.

#### Turn 20 **[PLAYER]**

I lift my hands like I’m surrendering and slide into the sedan fast—then I grab his pistol wrist with both hands and jam it up toward the roof. “Drive, you ink-fingered bastard—unless you want Vice shooting through your skull to get to me.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m cornered—Vice has a clear shot and Eddie’s warning feels real, but standing here gets me dead. I’ll buy half a second by playing compliant, then turn the gun line in my favor and keep my options open if Halden’s nearby.*

#### Turn 21 **[GAME]**

You go in hands-up, fast—hips sliding across wet leather—then your fingers clamp his gun wrist and you ram it toward the roofline.

The pistol barks inside the car.

The shot punches a neat hole through the headliner and out through the roof with a ringing tear of metal. Powder-smoke blooms in the tight space, sharp and sour. The man grunts, surprised more than hurt, and his free hand slams into your shoulder to pin you back against the seat.

Outside, Vice sees the muzzle flash through the window and answers with instinct: two shots crack into the sedan’s body—one spiderwebs the rear side glass, spraying cubes across the seatback; the other pings off the door frame near your elbow. Tiny shards bite your cheek and forearm.

“Ink-fingered bastard—drive,” you snarl, shoving his wrist higher, forcing the barrel away from you.

He doesn’t fight you like a club bruiser. He twists with practiced economy, turning his forearm so your grip loses leverage, then he headbutts forward—hard. Your vision bursts white at the edges as his forehead clips your brow. Not a knockout, but enough to loosen your hands.

“Driver!” he snaps, voice flat. “MOVE.”

Up front, the driver—another man, broad shoulders under a slicker—drops the sedan into gear. Tires spin on wet cobbles, then catch. The car surges.

As it lurches, the passenger rips his gun arm free and shoves the pistol muzzle down between the seats toward you again, close enough you can smell oil on the metal.

“You’re in my car,” he says, teeth tight. “You do *exactly* what I say.”

The sedan fishtails past the skittered Marrow case. In the side mirror you catch it for an instant: the Saints enforcer scoops it up one-handed, ignoring the Vice officer’s shouted orders. Eddie is still plastered to the brick shadow, staring after you like you just jumped off a pier.

Vice fires again—one last shot that cracks the trunk lid as you pull away—then the alley folds into fog and speed.

You are in a moving sedan with two Marrow men: driver in front, armed passenger beside you with a pistol inches from your ribs. The Vice and Saints are behind, and Eddie is left in the alley.

#### Turn 22 **[PLAYER]**

I wipe the blood off my brow with the back of my wrist, eyes locked on his. “Fine. Talk. Who are you—Marrow, Saints, or Halden’s pet?” I nod toward the rear window. “And if you’re smart, you tell your driver to lose the tail—because I’m not dying over a box I don’t even have anymore.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m outgunned and boxed in; if I fight now I’ll get shot. I need names, leverage, and a way to circle back for Eddie—or at least keep him alive.*

#### Turn 23 **[GAME]**

You wipe the blood; it smears dark across your wrist. The passenger’s eyes don’t leave your face, but the pistol eases back an inch—still aimed, no longer kissing you.

“Not Saints,” he says. “Not Halden’s anything.” He taps the key-pin with the gun hand like it’s a badge. “Marrow. Field side.”

The driver takes a hard right without being told, tires hissing, the sedan’s rear end stepping out before it straightens. Water fans off the wheels. Streetlamps smear into long yellow lines across the wet glass.

“Lose the tail,” you say.

The passenger flicks two fingers toward the windshield. “Rook—river road.”

Rook doesn’t answer. He just drives like he’s angry at the city: another turn, tighter, then a sudden brake-and-go that snaps your shoulder against the seat. Through the rear window you catch headlights—one set—bouncing at the corner you just took. Not a police cruiser; too low, too quiet. The Vice boys are likely still back at the club, but someone is following.

The passenger’s mouth tightens when he sees it. “Saints,” he says, like he’s tasting something rotten. “They got the case. That means they’ll want the *page* next.”

He leans in, voice low. “You shouting Halden in the alley wasn’t prayer. It was a flare. Someone heard it.”

As if to underline it, a car horn blats ahead—short, coded. Rook answers with a single flash of the headlights, then cuts the lamps entirely. The sedan plunges into a darker stretch where the fog sits thicker and the buildings lean closer.

The passenger finally lowers the pistol to his thigh, but keeps it in hand. “Name’s Sable,” he says. “And you’re right about one thing: you’re not dying over a box.”

He looks you over—blood, glass, the set of your jaw. “You’re dying if the Saints realize you don’t have it and start asking what you *do* have.”

The follower’s headlights vanish for a moment in the fog—then reappear closer than they should be, gaining.

Rook takes the next turn too fast, aiming the sedan toward the river road’s slick, open stretch—nowhere to hide if the tail sticks.

No one in this car is pretending anymore: you’re in a Marrow sedan running dark, with a Saints car closing in behind you.

#### Turn 24 **[PLAYER]**

I swallow the sting in my brow and lean closer, voice low. “Sable—listen. The Saints didn’t take *nothing* off me. They took the box because they think the page is with it… but the page isn’t in that case.”

I glance past him at Rook’s silhouette. “River road’s a shooting gallery. Tell your driver to cut into the dock service lanes by Pier Nine—there’s a chain gap by the fish sheds. We kill the lights, we swap direction, we let them overshoot into fog.”

Then I look Sable dead on. “And when we breathe again, you tell me what Marrow really wants with that page—because I’m not trading my skin for a secret I don’t even understand.”

*Agent reasoning: Sable’s playing hardball, but he’s also scared—Saints on our tail means we need leverage and a plan. I’ll offer information (the “page”) to buy cooperation, and push for a risky but plausible move: dump the tail near the river with a sudden stop-and-switch or a hard cut into a service lane I might know from dock runs.*

#### Turn 25 **[GAME]**



#### Turn 26 **[PLAYER]**

I grab Sable’s sleeve and jerk my chin toward the windshield. “Pier Nine—dock service lanes. Chain gap by the fish sheds. Tell Rook, now, or we’re targets on river road.”  
Then I lean in, eyes hard. “And after we shake them, you tell me what Marrow wants with that page—or I bail the first time this car slows.”

*Agent reasoning: The screen went blank like the Loom’s waiting on a choice; I’m not letting Sable steer my fate without answers, but I need his buy-in fast to survive the tail.*

#### Turn 27 **[GAME]**

Your fingers bite into Sable’s sleeve. The fabric’s good wool—expensive—and under it there’s a hard band of muscle that doesn’t flinch.

Sable’s eyes flick to your hand, then to the rear window where the headlights swell and dip in the fog.

He makes a quick decision.

“Rook—Pier Nine. Service lanes. Fish sheds,” Sable snaps, and for the first time there’s heat in his voice. “Chain gap.”

Rook’s head tilts a fraction, like he’s checking a map only he can see. Then the sedan veers left, not toward the open river road but into the dock grid—narrower streets, stacked crates, black puddles, and the stink of brine and diesel. He kills the headlights without slowing. The world outside becomes silhouettes: gantry cranes like praying mantises, warehouse doors like shut mouths.

Behind you, the Saints’ car doesn’t follow the turn clean. Its headlights sweep past the intersection—overshooting—then brake lights flare red in the fog as it corrects.

“Now,” you hiss. “Swap direction.”

Rook doesn’t. Not yet.

He takes you deeper first—two quick turns that put you between fish sheds and a fenced service lane. Up ahead, the chain gap you remember is there… but it isn’t empty.

Two dock sentries stand by the break in the chain, cigarettes glowing. One lifts a hand, palm out, as the sedan rolls toward them dark. The other’s coat bulges at the hip—gun.

Rook brakes hard. The sedan noses down. Your stomach lurches.

Sable’s pistol comes up again, not at you—toward the windshield. “Don’t,” he warns, more to Rook than to you.

The sentry with the cigarette steps forward, squinting into the dark. “Who’s there?” he calls. “You’re not supposed to—”

Behind, the Saints’ headlights bloom at the far end of the lane, closer now, sweeping between sheds as they hunt the turn you made.

You’re boxed in: chain gap guarded ahead, Saints closing behind, and you’re sitting in a dark sedan with a Marrow gun raised.

Sable leans close enough that you can smell his breath—peppermint trying to cover fear. “Marrow wants the page because it proves the Vice Bureau’s pay list,” he says, clipped. “Names. Dates. Payments. It buys us the tunnel permits without a fight—or it buys us their silence.”

The sentry’s hand drops to his hip.

“Window,” Sable says to you, low and urgent. “Tell them you belong here, or this turns loud.”

#### Turn 28 **[PLAYER]**

I roll the window down just a crack and lean into the dark, keeping my hands visible. “Easy—Evelyn Marlowe. I’m late and I’m not alone; Halden’s expecting me through the gap, now.”  
I flick my eyes to the bulge at the sentry’s hip. “You want a password, ask Halden why he owes the Marrow boys tunnel permits—otherwise step aside before the Saints’ headlights find all of us.”

*Agent reasoning: I’ve worked docks before and I can sell a lie fast; if these sentries stall us, the Saints will pin us. I’ll play like I’m expected, give them a name they’ll recognize, and keep it moving while Sable and Rook stay quiet and dangerous.*

#### Turn 29 **[GAME]**

The window drops a finger’s width. Fog pours in, cold and fish-stinked.

The cigarette tip flares as the nearer sentry leans toward your sliver of glass. “Evelyn Marlowe,” he repeats, like he’s checking the name against something he already decided. His eyes flick past you, trying to make out shapes in the back seat.

At “Halden,” the second sentry—the one with the bulge—goes still. His hand doesn’t draw, but it settles on the grip under his coat. Not dock muscle. Trained.

“You don’t say ‘Halden’ out loud down here,” he says. Flat. “Not unless you want everyone to hear it.”

Your line about tunnel permits lands wrong—too sharp, too accurate. The cigarette sentry’s face tightens; he takes a half-step back from the car like he suddenly expects it to explode.

The armed sentry raises his chin toward the lane behind you. “Saints are already here,” he says, and there’s no sympathy in it. “So either you’re a fool… or you’re bait.”

Behind, the Saints’ headlights sweep the mouth of the service lane and pause—searching. You hear an engine idle, then the crunch of tires on gravel as their car creeps forward. A door opens. A man’s voice carries, low and amused: “Found you.”

The armed sentry makes a quick, ugly choice: he yanks the chain up and hooks it higher—opening the gap wider—but he doesn’t wave you through. He points, instead, at the narrow cut between two sheds on your right.

“Not through the main,” he says. “Cut between the fish sheds. There’s a back spur to Pier Nine. Go *now*.”

Then he steps into the lane and lifts his free hand toward the Saints’ lights like he’s about to play traffic cop, buying you seconds. The cigarette sentry moves with him, nervous, glancing at your sedan like he expects you to bolt.

Inside the car, Rook’s hands tighten on the wheel, waiting for the call. Sable’s pistol stays up, angled toward the windshield.

The threat is immediate and specific: the Saints are close enough that you can hear a door and a voice, and if you don’t move in the next heartbeat they’ll have a clear line into this lane—and into your dark sedan.

#### Turn 30 **[PLAYER]**

“Rook—between the sheds, now!” I hiss, ducking low and planting a hand on the dash to steady myself. “Sable, keep that gun off me and on the lane—if they step in front, you scare ’em, you don’t singe my hair.”

*Agent reasoning: The sentry just gave us a narrow escape route and bought us seconds; if we hesitate, the Saints get a clear shot. I’ll push Rook to move, keep Sable focused forward, and brace for the squeeze-through.*

#### Turn 31 **[GAME]**

Rook moves the instant you hiss it—hard right, wheel cranked. The sedan lurches off the lane and into the narrow cut between fish sheds where the ground turns to rutted muck and scattered ice. Your palm slaps the dash; the car bucks, suspension groaning, and a crate edge scrapes along the passenger side with a scream of wood on paint.

Sable shifts with the turn, not graceful—professional. His pistol tracks away from you and toward the rear window.

Behind, the Saints’ headlights catch the sentries in the lane. The armed sentry throws his arm up like he owns the road. “Hold it! Authorized—” he barks.

A Saints voice answers, closer than it should be: “Authorized by who?”

Then a shot cracks—sharp, flat. The armed sentry jerks and folds at the waist, dropping out of the headlights like a marionette with cut strings. The cigarette man stumbles back, hands up, and bolts toward the sheds.

Rook punches the gas. The sedan fishtails, tires spitting brine and gravel, and shoots down the gap. For a second you see the lane behind framed between shed walls: Saints silhouettes spilling forward, one man with a pistol up, another with a shotgun held low as he runs.

Sable fires once through the rear window—deafening in the tight car. The glass spiders and blows outward in a spray. His shot isn’t aimed to kill; it’s aimed to make them duck. One of the Saints drops behind a piling, the shotgun man flinching aside as pellets don’t come—just the threat.

But the Saints recover fast. A second later the shotgun barks anyway, not at you directly but into the shed wall—wood explodes into splinters that whip past the car like angry insects. A chunk of plank smashes the rear quarter panel with a dull thud.

Rook threads the sedan onto a back spur—narrow rails half-buried in mud—leading toward Pier Nine. Ahead, the fog thins just enough to show a squat warehouse with fresh chalk marks on its basement doorframe: surveyors’ lines, and beneath them a small, marrow-white key symbol.

The immediate threat: the Saints are in pursuit on foot with firearms and have line-of-fire down the shed cut; your rear window is gone and the car has taken a hit, but you’ve bought distance and reached the spur toward the marked basement door.

#### Turn 32 **[PLAYER]**

“Rook—warehouse. Right up on that door, then kill it.” I duck low, eyes on the chalk key, and grab the handle. “Sable, you said tunnel permits—this better be the damn tunnel.”

As soon as we’re close enough, I shove the door open and slip out into the fog, one hand pressed to my brow. “Move—inside, now. And if that page buys silence, you’re gonna tell me whose names are on it once we’re breathing.”

*Agent reasoning: We need cover fast and that key mark screams Marrow hide or tunnel access; staying in the car with no rear window is asking to get stitched up. I’ll push them into the warehouse basement while keeping Sable focused on the threat and Rook ready to peel out.*

#### Turn 33 **[GAME]**

Rook swings the sedan tight to the warehouse wall, bumper almost kissing the chalk-marked basement door. The engine cuts; the sudden quiet is worse than the gunshots—just fog drip and your own breath.

You shove your door open and slide out low. Cold air hits your face like a slap. Your hand goes to your brow and comes away wet—not blood, just rain and grit flung up by the sheds. The warehouse looms, brick sweating, the key symbol starkly white against the dark.

Sable gets out on your side fast, using the car as cover, pistol up. “Move,” he snaps—at you, at Rook, at the fog.

Rook comes around the rear, and you see the damage: the back window is a jagged mouth, and the rear quarter panel is peppered and dented.

You reach for the basement door handle.

It doesn’t budge.

There’s a fresh padlock on it—new brass, still too clean for dock air—threaded through the hasp. Someone expected this door to be used and decided to control who used it.

From the spur behind you: a shout, then the wet slap of running feet on mud and rail ties. Saints, closing—no longer just headlights and silhouettes. You catch a flicker of a flashlight beam between sheds, bouncing as it runs.

Sable swears under his breath and plants himself at the corner of the warehouse, pistol aimed down the spur. He doesn’t fire yet—he’s counting seconds, listening for how many sets of feet.

Rook grabs the padlock, yanks, tests it once. “Locked,” he says unnecessarily, voice tight. His eyes dart along the wall—looking for another way in.

Then the first Saints man appears at the mouth of the spur, fog parting around his shoulders. He’s close enough you can see the brim of his cap and the pale oval of his face. He raises his pistol and takes aim at the sedan, not at you—smart, trying to pin you behind it.

“Hands where I can see ’em!” he barks. “Step away from the door!”

A second beam snaps on, higher—another man, further back, sweeping the warehouse face like he’s looking for a different entrance.

You have a locked basement door marked with the Marrow key, Sable posted with a gun at the corner, Rook exposed at the lock, and at least two Saints with a pistol and a light taking control of the spur—close enough to shoot, close enough to rush.

#### Turn 34 **[PLAYER]**

I lift my hands slow, stepping half a pace away from the door like I’m scared, but I keep my body between their line and Rook. “Easy, boys—nobody’s looking to die in the fog.”

Without turning my head, I hiss, “Rook—side window, fire escape, anything. Sable—don’t shoot unless they rush.” Then I call out, voice sharper, “You really wanna start a war over a padlock? Tell your man with the light to stop painting targets and come talk like he’s got a brain.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re pinned and the door’s locked—talking buys seconds while I look for another way in. I’ll bluff confidence, keep their eyes on me, and shove Rook toward a side entrance while Sable covers.*

#### Turn 35 **[GAME]**

Your hands come up slow, palms out. You take that half-step away from the door—just enough to look compliant—while keeping your body between the Saints’ sightline and Rook’s hands at the lock.

It works, partly.

The lead Saints man keeps his pistol trained center-mass on you, but his voice drops a notch. “That’s right,” he says. “Stay pretty and still.”

The flashlight beam wavers, then lifts off your chest and crawls up the warehouse face instead—less of a target-paint, more of a search. The man holding it doesn’t come forward; he angles to the left, trying to get a better look down the wall and past the sedan. He’s not here to “talk,” he’s here to trap.

“War?” the lead man snorts. “This ain’t war, sweetheart. This is cleanup.”

Behind you, Rook takes the opening. He slides along the brick, keeping low, and finds a narrow, grime-caked window set at shoulder height—old basement glass with a rusted wire mesh. He tests it with his fingertips, then puts his shoulder into it.

The glass doesn’t shatter clean. It cracks with a sharp pop and holds for a heartbeat—then gives with a crunch. A slice of jagged pane drops inward, clinking against something metal inside.

That sound changes everything.

The flashlight man snaps the beam hard onto the window. “There!” he barks.

The lead Saints man’s pistol swings off you toward Rook. “Get away from that—”

Sable, true to your hissed order, doesn’t fire. But he shifts his stance at the corner, bringing his gun up into a ready two-handed grip, making it clear that if they shoot at Rook, there will be an answer.

The Saints don’t shoot yet. Instead, the lead man steps forward fast, trying to close the distance and physically take control before bullets start flying. You can see his free hand coming up—either to grab you and use you as a shield, or to shove you aside and rush the window.

Threat, immediate and specific: one Saints gunman is advancing to seize control at arm’s length while another keeps a light trained on Rook at the broken basement window; if the lead man gets hands on you or gets a clear shot line on Rook, gunfire is likely in the next second.

#### Turn 36 **[PLAYER]**

I take one small step toward him like I’m about to plead, eyes wide—then I snap my knee up hard into his groin and shove him off-balance into the mud. “Rook—now! In!”

I dart sideways toward the broken window, grabbing a fist-sized chunk of brick or rubble from the ground and whipping it at the flashlight to kill the beam, then I duck low by the wall and hiss to Sable, “Cover us—don’t be a hero, just keep their heads down!”

*Agent reasoning: I can’t let him grab me or get a clean line on Rook; I’ll play soft for a beat, then go mean and close—hit him where it counts and use the moment to get us inside.*

#### Turn 37 **[GAME]**

You step in like you’re going to beg.

The Saints gunman commits—weight forward, reaching.

Your knee comes up hard and clean. It lands with a dull, sick thump. His breath leaves him in a wet gasp and his pistol arm jerks wide as his body folds. You shove him and he goes down into the mud on one hip, then both knees, gagging—still conscious, still armed, but not coordinated.

“Son of a—” he chokes, trying to find his gun again.

You break sideways for the wall.

Your fingers find a fist-sized chunk of brick near a crumbled patch of mortar. You whip it at the light.

It hits the flashlight dead-on with a sharp *crack*—glass bursts, the beam dies instantly. The man holding it yelps and jerks his hand back, cursing, more surprised than hurt.

But the darkness doesn’t save you for long.

The flashlight man immediately draws his pistol with his other hand and fires a blind shot toward where the window noise came from. The round smacks into brick above you, spitting a spray of grit and a sharp sting across your cheek.

Sable answers your hiss the only way he can—by making them keep their heads down. He leans out from the warehouse corner and puts two shots downrange, controlled and low. Not to kill—close enough to make the flashlight man flinch back behind a piling and stop advancing.

Rook doesn’t waste the moment. He hooks his hands into the broken frame and hauls himself through the basement window, coat snagging on the wire mesh. The mesh bites; it tears with a metallic screech, and he drops inside with a heavy thud and a grunt.

From inside the warehouse comes a new sound: a hurried scrape of boots on concrete and the rattle of something bumped—like stacked crates or shelving.

Outside, the groin-shot Saints man is on all fours in the mud, trying to rise, pistol shaking in his hand. He’s furious now, face twisted, and he’s looking right at you along the wall.

Threat, immediate: one Saints gunman is regaining his feet at close range with a pistol and a clear angle on you by the wall; another is behind cover but armed and likely to push up now that the light is out; you have an open (but jagged) basement window as your only entry, and Rook is inside but not yet in a position to help you.

#### Turn 38 **[PLAYER]**

I snatch up another chunk of grit and brick dust and fling it straight at his eyes, then lunge low and kick his gun hand sideways as I dive for the broken window. “Sable—keep ’em down!” I hiss, and haul myself through the frame, ignoring the bite of glass.

*Agent reasoning: He’s too close and angry to trust; if I hesitate he’ll put a round in me. I need to break his aim for one second and get through that window, and Sable can keep the other one pinned.*

#### Turn 39 **[GAME]**

You scoop up a handful of wet grit and brick dust and snap it into his face.

He jerks back with a raw yelp, blinking hard, one hand flying up instinctively. For half a second his pistol dips and his stance loosens—enough.

You go low and drive your boot into his gun wrist, not trying to break it, just to spoil the shot. The pistol cracks once anyway—wild—slamming into the mud by your ankle with a wet *thunk* that sprays your stocking.

Then you’re already moving.

You dive for the broken basement window and haul yourself through. The frame bites immediately: a jagged tooth of glass drags across your forearm and then your ribs as you twist. It’s a hot, tearing sting. Blood slicks your skin in the cold air, and your sleeve starts to darken fast.

Inside, you drop hard onto concrete, shoulder-first, the breath knocked out of you.

Rook is a few yards in, crouched behind a stack of old shipping crates. He grabs your elbow and yanks you deeper into the basement’s shadow. “Jesus, Eve—move,” he hisses.

Outside, Sable fires again—two sharp reports—forcing the second Saints man to stay pinned behind cover. But you also hear more feet now, closer than before, and a shouted order: “AROUND—GET THE OTHER SIDE!”

The Saints you kneed is still outside, blinded and raging. He scrapes at his eyes and barks hoarsely, “She went in! Basement—window!”

The basement itself is unfinished and damp: low ceiling, brick walls sweating, and a narrow corridor running deeper under the warehouse. Along the far wall, half-hidden by crates, there’s a heavy interior door with fresh chalk markings like the one outside—survey lines and a crude key symbol. A thin line of light shows under it, like there’s a lit space beyond.

Immediate threat: Saints are moving to flank the warehouse exterior and will likely try to enter through the window after you; you’re bleeding from fresh cuts and inside an unfamiliar basement with one deeper door that looks recently used.

#### Turn 40 **[PLAYER]**

I clamp a hand over my bleeding forearm, jaw tight. “Rook—get that door. If it’s the tunnel, we’re taking it.”  

Then I crawl back toward the window just enough to hiss into the fog, “Sable! Inside—now, through the window. They’re flanking!”

*Agent reasoning: I’m hurt and we’re seconds from getting swarmed; the chalk-key door is our only real way forward, but I won’t leave Sable outside if I can help it.*

#### Turn 41 **[GAME]**



#### Turn 42 **[PLAYER]**

I press my palm hard to my bleeding forearm and grit my teeth. “Rook—get that door. If it’s the tunnel, we take it, no questions.”  

I creep back to the broken window and hiss out into the fog, “Sable! Inside—now, through the window. They’re flanking the warehouse!”

*Agent reasoning: I’m cut and we’re about to get boxed in; getting Sable inside and pushing for the chalk-marked door is the only way we don’t end up trapped at the window.*

#### Turn 43 **[GAME]**

Your palm mashes into the cut and the bleeding slows to an ooze, but it hurts like a fresh burn. When you whisper to Rook, he doesn’t argue—just nods once, jaw set.

He slides to the chalk-marked door, keeps his shoulder tight to the brick, and tests the knob.

Locked.

He digs in his pocket for a thin pick and a stubby tension wrench, hands fast but not magical—metal ticks softly in the damp. “Give me ten,” he mutters, eyes flicking to you, then back to the lock.

You creep to the window and hiss into the fog.

Outside, Sable answers with a clipped, “On it—” and then a gunshot interrupts him, close. Not one of his. The report is sharper, nearer the alley mouth. A voice barks, “There! By the corner!”

Sable fires back—two quick shots—then you hear him sprint, shoes slapping wet cobbles, breath harsh. He reaches the window and grabs the sill.

A Saints man appears in the fog behind him, just an outline and a pistol arm. He fires at Sable’s back.

The shot hits the brick edge of the window frame, showering sparks and chips. Sable flinches and drops, then commits—he hauls himself through anyway, coat tearing on the wire mesh with the same ugly screech Rook made. He lands inside on one knee, revolver up, and immediately swings it toward the window.

Outside, another voice—closer, to the side now—calls, “Get in after ’em! Don’t let ’em into the tunnel!”

Sable spits, “They know about the door,” and plants himself low beside the window, aiming out into the fog to cover it.

Rook’s pick stutters in the lock. He curses under his breath. “This isn’t a cheap padlock—”

Then, from deeper beyond the chalk-marked door, you hear it: a faint clink of metal and a soft, human cough—someone is on the other side, close enough that the light under the door shifts as if a shadow passed.

Threats, clear: Saints are converging on the window and may try to climb in at any second; the chalk-marked door is locked and someone appears to be moving on the far side of it.

#### Turn 44 **[PLAYER]**

I press my back to the brick between the window and the door, voice low and sharp. “Rook—if it jams again, we break it. I don’t care how loud.”

I lean close to the door and call, “Hey—on the other side. Open up unless you want the Saints crawling into your lap.”

Then I flick my eyes to Sable at the window. “If a head shows, you clip the wall beside it—make ’em think twice. Don’t let ’em climb in.”

*Agent reasoning: Someone’s on the other side of that door and the Saints are seconds from piling through the window; talking might buy us a heartbeat, but we need that lock open now and the window covered.*

#### Turn 45 **[GAME]**

Rook’s jaw flexes at your order. He keeps working the pick anyway—stubborn, careful—because breaking it means attention, and attention means bodies.

You lean in to the chalk-marked door, close enough to smell damp lime and fresh chalk, and call out.

For a beat there’s only the basement drip and the distant rain.

Then a voice answers from the other side, close and controlled, like someone with their ear to the wood. “Don’t say that name in here,” it snaps—meaning *Saints*—as if the word itself could carry. “Back up from the door.”

A latch clicks—then stops. Whatever’s holding it isn’t just a simple lock.

“You alone?” the voice asks. Male. Not Saints-brawler rough; more educated, but strained. “Because if you brought trouble—”

Sable shifts at the window, taking your instruction as gospel. A shadow rises in the fog outside—someone trying to get eyes on the opening.

Sable fires exactly where you told him: not at flesh, but at brick. The round smacks the exterior wall with a sharp *crack*, spraying grit. The shadow jerks back with a shouted curse. Another voice answers, angry and immediate: “They’re in there! Window—now!”

Bootsteps scrape on stone and then on wood—someone climbing onto something outside to reach the sill. You hear fingers on the broken frame, glass tinkling as weight settles.

Rook’s pick jams hard. He yanks it free with a small metallic squeal and whispers, “It’s warded with a secondary catch—someone *meant* to slow this.”

From the other side of the door, the man exhales once, like a decision made under pressure. “If they breach that window, I’m barring you out,” he says flatly. “You want in, you do it fast.”

The light under the door brightens as if a lantern is brought closer. You can see the outline of a boot on the other side, braced against the wood—whoever it is is ready to shove back if the door gives.

Clear threats now: a Saints man is actively climbing in through the window; more are seconds behind him. The door is still locked from your side, and the person beyond will not open fully unless you get through quickly—he’s prepared to seal you out if the Saints get inside.

#### Turn 46 **[PLAYER]**

I bare my teeth at the door. “Not alone—two friends, and we’re not Saints.”  

I grab the heaviest loose bit of crate timber within reach and ram it into the lock side like a battering bar. “Rook—again, now—on my hit!”  

To Sable, without looking back: “Shoot the first hand that grabs the sill.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re seconds from a Saint coming through the window; talking won’t save us. Rook’s pick is failing, so I’ll force the door while Sable holds the window—risk the noise over getting trapped.*

#### Turn 47 **[GAME]**

You snatch a slab of crate timber—wet, splintery, heavier than it looks—and drive it into the doorframe right where the lock bites. The impact booms through the basement like a drum hit.

Rook flinches at the sound, then drops to his knee and jams his tools in again on your second strike, trying to catch the catch while the wood’s still flexing. “Hit—hit—” he hisses.

You ram it again. The frame shudders. A seam opens for an instant—thin as a knife blade—then snaps back.

On the other side, the man grunts and braces harder. “Stop—!” he barks, and you hear a bolt slide into place—metal on metal—adding a deeper resistance. He’s not helping you; he’s reinforcing it.

At the window, a hand appears—pale knuckles, ring on one finger—curling over the broken sill.

Sable doesn’t hesitate. He fires once.

The shot punches through the hand with a wet crack. Blood spatters the outside brick and the fingers vanish, followed by a scream that turns into panicked shouting: “Jesus—my hand!”

But your battering has already bought you something you didn’t want: the Saints now know exactly where you’re trying to go. Boots pound closer and the fog fills with bodies. Someone outside yells, “They’re on the tunnel door—get an iron on it!”

A second Saints man lunges up toward the window anyway, more desperate than smart. Sable snaps his revolver up again, but he’s got to lean to get the angle—exposing himself.

Rook’s pick finally slips past something with a sharp *click*—not open, but loosened. “One more good hit,” he says, voice tight, “and it’ll give—unless he’s bolted it from his side for good.”

From beyond the door, the voice goes cold. “You break that frame and you’ll bring the whole pack down here. Last warning: back off, or I’ll put a round through the wood.”

Immediate threats, plain: Saints are actively attempting to force the window and are calling for heavier muscle; Sable has wounded one climber but is about to be targeted; the man behind the door has reinforced it and is threatening to shoot through if you keep ramming.

#### Turn 48 **[PLAYER]**

I drop the timber and raise my bloody hand toward the door like a white flag. “Alright—alright. Don’t shoot. We’re backing off.”

I step away from the door and call low, steady, “Name’s Eve Marlowe. I sing at the Velvet Aster. Not Saints, not cops—just trying not to get gutted out there. If you’re sitting on a tunnel, you want us *through* it, not bleeding on your threshold.”

Over my shoulder, I snap to Rook, “Pick it—quiet. No more hits.” Then to Sable, “Stay low—if he climbs, put one in his shoulder and drop him.”

*Agent reasoning: That voice behind the door is scared and armed—if I keep ramming, he’ll shoot and we’ll be trapped between him and the Saints. I need to buy trust fast while keeping Sable alive at the window, and give Rook a quieter way to finish the lock.*

#### Turn 49 **[GAME]**

You let the timber drop with a dull thud and lift your bleeding hand. You step back far enough from the jamb that if a round comes through, it won’t take your throat with it.

On the other side of the door, silence—then the scrape of a shoe shifting. The lantern-light under the door steadies.

“Eve Marlowe,” the man repeats, tasting it like he’s deciding whether it’s worth remembering. “Velvet *Aster*?” There’s a dry edge to it, like he caught the lie or the mistake.

A small sliding panel you hadn’t noticed—set chest-high in the door—snicks open. A narrow rectangle of light falls across the damp floorboards. An eye appears in it, sharp and unblinking.

“Show me your hands,” he says. “Both. And the case—if you’ve got one.”

At the window, Sable stays low, but the Saints don’t. A head and shoulders rise into view, bolder now, one arm hooked over the sill. He’s got a short-barreled pistol clutched awkwardly in his good hand, shaking with pain and rage.

Sable fires as instructed—one round into the climber’s shoulder. The man’s body jerks; his pistol discharges wild into the ceiling beams with a splintering crack, and then he drops out of sight with a howl. Immediately, return fire snaps from the fog—two shots punch into the interior brick near the window, throwing dust and chips across Sable’s sleeve.

“Down!” Sable barks, flattening himself, but he’s pinned—if he rises to shoot, they’ve got his angle.

Rook, breathing shallow, goes back to the lock without another impact. His picks whisper and click—quiet, patient work. The lock gives a tiny, promising twitch… then stops hard again as if caught on that secondary catch.

Outside, a new sound cuts through the rain: metal dragged across stone. An iron bar, maybe a pry. And a voice—closer than before—calls, “Get the long tool! We’ll peel the frame!”

At the door’s peephole, the eye narrows. “You’ve got about ten seconds before they’re in that window,” the man says. “Decide what you’re offering me, Miss Marlowe. Fast.”

#### Turn 50 **[PLAYER]**

I lift both hands into the little slit of light, palms out, blood slick on one. “No case. Just me and my boys and a lot of bad luck.”

I pitch my voice calm, intimate. “And it’s the Velvet **Aster**, not ‘Aster’—I sing the late set. You’ve heard me, or you wouldn’t be smirking. Open up and I’ll owe you a favor you can collect in daylight… and I’ll tell you which Saints lieutenant is out there peeling your window frame.”

Without dropping my hands, I cut my eyes to Rook. “Quiet—find the catch.” Then, louder to the door, “Or we can all die polite on your threshold. Your choice.”

*Agent reasoning: The man’s testing me and time’s bleeding out; I’ll trade identity and leverage—names, favors, and a promise—while keeping my hands visible and buying Rook seconds to work. Also, I slipped on the club name; I’ll correct it to sound real.*

#### Turn 51 **[GAME]**

Your hands hang in the slit of light, palms out. The blood on one glistens black-red in the lantern glow.

The eye in the peephole holds on you a long second. Then the panel slides wider—enough for you to see part of a face: a thin cheek, the edge of a neat mustache, and a collar that looks too clean for a basement. He isn’t smirking. He’s measuring.

“I haven’t heard you,” he says. “But I’ve read about you. Which is worse.”

Outside, the Saints’ “long tool” arrives with a scrape and a grunt. The iron bar’s hooked end bites into the window frame. Wood groans. The broken sill shifts a fraction inward.

Sable, still pinned, fires blind once toward the bar. The shot rings off something metallic with a *clang*—a miss. Immediate return fire cracks back; a round punches through the interior edge of the window frame and chips plaster near Rook’s shoulder. Rook flinches but doesn’t move off the lock.

“Catch is—” Rook whispers, then stops as the lock fights him. Sweat shines on his lip. “It’s spring-loaded. Needs pressure *and* turn.”

At the door, the man’s gaze flicks past you to the window and back. You see his decision tighten.

“Name the lieutenant,” he says. “Now. And if you lie, I leave you to them.”

Another wrench of the iron bar. The window frame splinters with a sharp crack. A Saints man’s face appears in the opening—flat cap, wet hair plastered to his forehead, eyes bright with hate. He shoves his pistol through first, searching for a target.

Sable can’t stay down and still stop that gun. He rises just enough to get a line and fires.

The shot takes the Saints man high in the shoulder/neck line—hard enough that his pistol jerks and clatters against the sill. But he doesn’t fall cleanly; he slumps forward into the opening, half-blocking it with deadweight and thrashing.

The threat is immediate and concrete: the window is being pried open and a gun is coming through; Sable is drawing fire; Rook is one mistake away from catching a bullet; and the man behind the door will only open if you give him a name he believes—fast.

#### Turn 52 **[PLAYER]**

“Lieutenant Crowley—Eamon ‘Crow’ Crowley. He’s the one who likes iron bars and loud lessons.”

I drop my left hand and press my shoulder into the doorframe, fingers sliding low to the lock to add pressure where Rook needs it. “Rook—turn it now, I’ll hold the spring.”

Over my shoulder at Sable, sharp and urgent: “Drag that bastard’s body into the frame—jam it tight. Then get down!”

*Agent reasoning: I need him to open the door now; I’ll gamble with a real name I’ve heard whispered around docks, and I’ll physically help Rook with the spring catch while keeping Sable from getting boxed in.*

#### Turn 53 **[GAME]**

“Crowley,” the man behind the door repeats instantly—no hesitation, like the name fits a slot in his head. The peephole panel snaps shut.

For half a breath you think he’s leaving you to it.

Then you hear the internal bolt slide back—heavy, reluctant metal—and the lock hardware shifts with a clean, deliberate *clack*. He didn’t trust your bargain; he trusted the name.

You drop your left hand and drive your shoulder into the jamb, fingers finding the cold edge of the mechanism. Rook’s eyes cut to your hand; he nods once and turns his pick with a careful twist while you hold pressure on the spring.

The lock gives. Not a little—fully. The door lurches inward an inch.

A gunshot answers from the fog outside—aimed at movement. The round punches through the door’s upper panel with a fist-sized burst of splinters, just above where your head had been when you leaned in. The man behind the door yanks it wider and drags you across the threshold by your coat sleeve, hard enough to make your shoulder bark.

“Inside. Now,” he snaps.

Rook ducks and slips through after you, keeping low. As he crosses, another shot cracks; the bullet chews the floorboard where his foot was a second before.

At the window, Sable grabs the wounded Saints man by the collar and belt and hauls. The body scrapes, then wedges into the opening with a wet thump—shoulders jammed against the frame, head lolling. It buys you seconds, not safety: the iron bar keeps prying from outside, levering against ribs and wood alike. You can hear Saints cursing as they try to drag their man back and keep the opening.

Sable dives down and rolls toward the door, taking a grazing hit—his sleeve tears and a line of blood opens along his upper arm. He grunts but keeps moving.

The man behind the door—up close now: neat mustache, gray suit under a raincoat, and a small white key pin at his lapel—slams the door shut and throws the bolt back in. The frame shudders as something heavy hits it from the outside.

He keeps one hand on the bolt and levels a compact pistol with the other at all three of you.

“Crowley’s outside,” he says flatly. “That name just bought you entry. It didn’t buy you trust.”

From beyond the door: the iron bar bites again, wood creaking under strain. They’re trying the window and now they’re testing this door too. You’re inside—but you’re trapped in a narrow corridor smelling of wet chalk and river stone, with an armed Marrow man between you and whatever the tunnel actually leads to.

#### Turn 54 **[PLAYER]**

I hold my hands up slow, palms open, and meet his aim without flinching. “Trust’s a luxury, sweetheart. Right now you’ve got a door that’s turning into kindling.”

I tilt my chin toward Sable’s bleeding arm. “We’re not here to rob you—we’re here to breathe. Let us past and I’ll give you more than Crowley’s name: I’ll tell you who paid him to come sniffing this tunnel.”

I glance at the white key pin, then back to his eyes. “And if you need collateral, take my purse—take my coat—hell, take my *songbook*. Just don’t make me beg on a doorstep while your frame gives way.”

*Agent reasoning: He’s got a gun on us and we’re boxed in; I need to de-escalate fast, prove usefulness, and get us moving deeper before the Saints breach. I’ll give him leverage—information and a small concession—without handing him our throats.*

#### Turn 55 **[GAME]**

He doesn’t lower the pistol, but the muzzle stops wandering between faces and settles on your center mass—steady, professional. Your calm doesn’t soften him; it convinces him you’re not panicking, which makes you either useful or dangerous.

“Sweetheart,” he repeats, almost politely. “Don’t.”

Another hit slams the outside of the door. The bolt holds, but the frame gives a sharp creak at the top hinge—wood fibers complaining. Dust sifts down from the lintel.

Sable presses his bleeding arm tight to his ribs, jaw clenched, eyes flicking to the door like he’s counting impacts. Rook keeps his hands visible and quiet, breathing through his nose, watching the Marrow man’s trigger finger.

The key-pin man makes a quick decision. With his left hand still on the bolt, he reaches into his coat with his right—pistol never leaving you—then shifts the pistol to his left in one smooth motion and produces a small brass whistle in his right. He blows once: a short, sharp note that cuts through the corridor.

From deeper inside, you hear movement—boots on stone steps, close and fast. A woman’s voice calls back, low and irritated: “What is it?”

He answers without looking away from you. “Guests. Unscheduled.”

The woman appears at the far end of the corridor: dark hair pinned up, sleeves rolled, a lantern in one hand and a shotgun in the other. She takes in the three of you, the blood, the wet, the street stink, and she doesn’t ask questions—she just angles the shotgun toward the door.

Outside, the Saints change tactics. Instead of another body-check, you hear metal on metal: the rasp of something being set, then a hollow *thunk* against the door—like a clamp or a wedge. The prying stops for a second.

The woman with the shotgun swears under her breath. “They’re going to spike it and peel the bolt out.”

The key-pin man finally speaks to your offer. “You want past? Fine.” He jerks his chin down the corridor. “You walk. Slow. Hands where I can see. Your friend with the cut goes in the middle.”

Then, to you, quieter: “And you tell me who paid Crowley while we move. If I don’t like the answer, I don’t have to hand you back to them. I can put you in the river tunnel myself.”

He steps aside just enough to let you pass—still covering you—while the woman plants herself near the door, shotgun ready, listening to the Saints working the spike on the other side. The immediate threat is clear: the door is being mechanically defeated, and you have seconds to get deeper before it gives.

#### Turn 56 **[PLAYER]**

I start walking, slow like he asked, hands up where his eyes can count my fingers. “Alright—middle for Sable. Rook, stay close and keep your hands pretty.”

As we move, I angle my head back just enough to catch the key-pin man’s eye. “Crowley’s been taking envelopes from a man named Lasky—runs errands for Alderman Vance. Same face I’ve seen in the Velvet Aster’s back booths when the city gets thirsty.”

I flick a glance at the woman with the shotgun. “If that spike bites, you want us out of this hallway—where’s your next door, darlin’? Because I’d rather not get shot in the spine while I’m being cooperative.”

*Agent reasoning: Eve won’t freeze under a gun; she’ll comply while bargaining and reading the room. She’ll keep Sable moving, keep Rook from doing anything twitchy, and offer a plausible “who paid Crowley” that buys time without fully exposing her own ties.*

#### Turn 57 **[GAME]**

You move exactly the way he wants: slow, hands high, no sudden turns. Rook falls in behind you, shoulders tight. Sable, breathing hard through his teeth, takes the middle and keeps his bleeding arm pinned.

At “Lasky,” the key-pin man’s eyes narrow a fraction. At “Alderman Vance,” he actually blinks—once—and his jaw sets like you’ve confirmed something he didn’t want confirmed.

“Vance,” he says, tasting the name. “That’s a wider net than dock rats.”

Behind you, the door gives a different sound: not a slam, but a stressed *crack*—wood splitting where the spike is biting. The woman with the shotgun—lantern light catching the hard line of her cheek—backs away from the door and starts moving with you, keeping her muzzle trained down the corridor past your shoulders, ready to fire through you if she has to.

“Next door?” she snaps at your question, not sweet, not patient. “There isn’t one. There’s a stair and a choke.”

She swings the lantern toward a narrow set of stone steps descending into darkness. Chalk marks—survey lines and numbers—crawl along the wall, and the air down there is colder, wetter, threaded with a sour-river draft. A heavy steel gate sits at the bottom, half-open, with a chain and padlock hanging loose like it was just unfastened.

The key-pin man gestures with the pistol. “Down. Single file. Don’t touch the walls.”

You start down. Your shoes hit the first step—slick with condensation. Sable follows, careful, one hand on the rail despite the instruction; his palm leaves a faint smear of blood on the iron.

Up the corridor, the doorframe lets out a long, tearing groan. The bolt doesn’t pop yet, but the Saints have time and leverage.

As you reach the third step, something clatters from above—small and metallic—skittering along the corridor floor toward the stairwell.

The woman’s lantern catches it in a hop of light: a little tin cylinder, punched with holes.

Her face changes instantly. “Gas—!”

She shoves the lantern forward and drops to one knee, shotgun swinging toward the stairwell mouth as if she can shoot the canister back. The key-pin man lunges a half-step, pistol lowering—too late to stop it from rolling.

The canister hits the top step and hisses, spitting a thin white stream that starts to pour down toward you.

The threat is immediate and specific: the Saints are pumping gas into the corridor, and it’s flowing down the stairs after you.

#### Turn 58 **[PLAYER]**

I yank my coat up over my nose and mouth and wave the others to do the same. “Move—down, down, down! Gate!”  

I grab Sable by the belt with my free hand and half-drag him down the slick steps, barking back up the stair, “Shoot it if you can, but don’t you dare stand there breathing it!”

*Agent reasoning: Gas in a stairwell will sink and choke us fast; we need to get below the flow and seal the gate, and I’ll try to use my coat as a quick filter while pushing everyone down.*

#### Turn 59 **[GAME]**

You haul your coat over your face and the wool goes damp against your lips immediately. The gesture lands—Rook copies you fast, pulling his collar up and pinching fabric over his nose. Sable tries, but his good hand fumbles; you take his belt and drag, and his boots scrape the wet stone steps, nearly going out from under him.

The gas hits the stairwell like a low fog with teeth. It doesn’t pour like smoke; it *crawls* and clings, spilling down step by step. Your eyes sting even through the coat, and your throat tightens on the first involuntary breath.

“Gate!” you bark, and the steel bars at the bottom loom closer—half-open, chain dangling.

Above, the woman with the lantern snaps a single shotgun blast down at the canister. The shot doesn’t “send it back”—it shreds the top step and sprays pellets into the wall. The canister jumps, dented, but keeps hissing, rolling another half-step and vomiting more gas into the stairwell.

“Down—DOWN!” she coughs, voice already rough, and she retreats two paces, trying to keep her lungs shallow.

The key-pin man hesitates one fatal second to scoop the canister with his shoe—then thinks better of it and backs off, pistol hand shaking just slightly as the gas reaches his knees. “Move!” he orders, but it’s lost in a rasping cough.

You get Sable to the gate. It’s heavier than it looks, iron sweating with cold. You shove it and it swings inward with a metallic squeal, opening into a low tunnel of brick and stone where the air is colder but—thank God—cleaner.

Rook slips through first, then reaches back to take Sable’s weight. Between the two of you, you half-carry him inside. Sable’s breathing is loud and ugly; every inhale sounds like it’s scraping.

Behind you, the woman staggers onto the top steps, one hand clamped over her mouth, shotgun dangling. The key-pin man follows, eyes watering, trying to keep his pistol up.

Then the corridor door upstairs finally fails—wood cracking like a snapped bone—and you hear Saints voices surge in, muffled by gas and distance, followed by boots hitting the corridor boards.

Threat, clear and immediate: gas continues to seep down the stairs toward the gate, and Saints have breached the outer door and are moving in behind it.

#### Turn 60 **[PLAYER]**

I shove Sable fully into the tunnel and bark to Rook, “Get him breathing—keep him upright!”  

Then I grab the hanging chain and slam the gate shut, fumbling for the padlock. If it won’t catch fast, I rip the chain tight and jam it through the bars anyway, yelling up the steps at the key-pin man and the shotgun woman, “In here—now! Then give me your belt or anything metal—something to cinch this damn chain!”

*Agent reasoning: The Saints are seconds behind us and the gas will follow; we need to buy time by sealing the gate and slowing pursuit, even if it means getting my hands dirty and risking being caught at the choke.*

#### Turn 61 **[GAME]**

Sable stumbles the last step and you shove him fully into the tunnel. Rook catches him under the arm and hauls him upright against the damp brick, forcing him to keep his head up. “Breathe shallow,” Rook mutters, voice tight. Sable nods once, eyes glassy, and coughs hard enough to spit.

You swing the steel gate shut. It slams with a ringing clang that carries up the stairwell.

You snatch the chain—cold, greasy—and fumble the padlock. Your fingers are clumsy from sting-tears and urgency; the lock won’t seat on the first try. You don’t waste the second: you yank the chain tight and thread it back through the bars, jamming it so the gate can’t easily swing.

Up the steps, the key-pin man and the shotgun woman lurch into view, both half-blinded and coughing. They don’t argue—your shout and the breached door decide it.

The woman comes first, one hand scraping the wall for balance, shotgun tucked under her elbow. The key-pin man follows, pistol still in hand but lowered, his breaths short and shallow like he’s trying not to taste the air.

“In—now!” you yell again.

They spill through the gate just as the gas thickens at the stairwell mouth. The key-pin man slams his shoulder into the bars from your side to help you hold it closed while you keep working the chain.

“Belt,” you demand.

The woman rips hers free—thick leather with a simple steel buckle—and shoves it at you. “Make it quick,” she rasps. “They’ll be on the stairs in ten seconds.”

You loop the belt through the chain and cinch down hard; the buckle bites, drawing the chain tight enough that the gate shudders but doesn’t give when the key-pin man tests it with a shove.

Then the Saints arrive: bootfalls hammer the steps, fast and confident despite the coughing. A voice above barks, “Gate! Don’t let ‘em—”

Something heavy hits the bars from the stair side—once, then again—testing. The gate bows a fraction and the chain twangs under strain, but holds for the moment.

Immediate threat: the Saints are at the stairwell and starting to force the gate; the gas is still drifting down and pooling at the gate’s upper bars, meaning anyone near it is still breathing traces unless they back deeper into the tunnel.

#### Turn 62 **[PLAYER]**

I grab the key-pin man by the sleeve and yank him back from the bars. “Away from it—unless you like coughing up your lungs.”

I wave the shotgun woman to cover the tunnel and pull us deeper a few paces. “You—lantern down low, watch for feet. Rook, keep Sable moving.” Then I look hard at key-pin. “Where’s your choke, and what’s on the other side—another gate, a drop, a turn? Talk fast, ‘cause that chain’s a prayer, not a promise.”

*Agent reasoning: The gate will fail if we linger, and the gas is still curling through; I need us deeper and I need a plan from these Marrow people fast, while keeping Sable on his feet.*

#### Turn 63 **[GAME]**

You yank the key-pin man back and he comes, stumbling two steps into the cleaner dark. He doesn’t fight you—he’s already swallowing coughs like they’re nails. He wipes his eyes with the back of his hand, smearing tears across soot.

The shotgun woman pivots without being told twice, planting herself half-turned down-tunnel with the muzzle steady and the lantern lowered near her boots. The light slices under the brick curve, catching damp mortar, puddles, and the shine of old rails set into the floor—narrow-gauge, meant for a cart.

Rook keeps Sable moving. It’s ugly, but it’s forward: Sable’s boots drag, then find purchase; he leans hard into Rook’s shoulder, breath whistling.

Behind you, the gate takes another hard hit. The chain answers with a high, tight *twang*—metal under strain. A voice on the stairs coughs out, “Get a bar—get a—” and then dissolves into hacking.

You put the question to the key-pin man. He looks past you, calculating distances like a man who’s walked them with a stopwatch.

“The choke is thirty yards,” he says, voice raw. “Hard turn left—brick pinch, one man wide. After that—drop of three feet into a sluice run. Water, knee-deep if the river’s high. You go quiet there or you go nowhere.”

He gestures with two fingers down the tunnel, as if pointing costs him air. “Past the drop is a second gate—new steel. Marrow lock. I’ve got the key.”

The woman with the shotgun cuts in without looking back. “And if they’re already past it?” She keeps the lantern low, watching the floor like she expects company from the dark.

Key-pin man’s eyes flick to her, then back to you. “They’re not,” he says, but there’s a tell: he doesn’t sound sure, he sounds like he needs it to be true.

Another impact at the gate—this one followed by a grinding squeal, like someone’s wedged a pipe or crowbar into the bars. The chain doesn’t snap, but the gate shifts a hair in its frame.

Threat, plain: the Saints have tools on the stair side now and are actively prying the gate; you likely have under a minute before it gives, less if the belt buckle slips or the chain link deforms.

#### Turn 64 **[PLAYER]**

“Then we run for your pinch and pray the brick’s tighter than their shoulders.”

I grab the key-pin man by the back of his coat and shove him ahead. “You’re first—key in hand. If there’s a second gate, you open it the second we see it.”

To the shotgun woman, I nod toward the rails. “Lantern low and shutter it if you can—no hero silhouettes.” Then to Rook, softer but sharp: “Keep Sable’s head up at that drop. If he goes under, I’m not dragging a corpse through knee-deep water.”

I start us moving at a hard, careful trot down the tunnel, listening over my shoulder for the moment the chain finally sings its last note.

*Agent reasoning: The gate won’t hold; we need to get to the choke fast and use it to slow them. I don’t trust key-pin man, so I’ll keep him in front with the key and keep the lantern low to avoid giving away our position, while making sure Sable doesn’t drown or collapse at the drop.*

#### Turn 65 **[GAME]**

You drive the key-pin man forward and he goes, one hand already digging into his coat. Metal glints—an old-fashioned keyring, heavy with two keys: one long-bit, one smaller warded key. He keeps them out in front of him like a divining rod.

The shotgun woman pinches the lantern’s shutter down to a narrow slit. The light becomes a thin, low blade skating along the rails and puddles, enough to see feet and not much else. “No silhouettes,” she repeats, almost to herself, and takes the rear, shotgun angled back toward where the gate is.

Rook grunts acknowledgment and keeps Sable moving. Sable’s legs are starting to work again, but he’s still not right—his cough comes in wet bursts, and his hand keeps pawing at his own throat like he’s trying to pull it open.

You push into a hard trot. The tunnel floor changes underfoot: rails, then slick stone between them, then a patch of crushed gravel that crunches too loud until everyone instinctively shortens steps.

Behind you, the chain finally gives its last warning note—not a snap, but a tortured metallic whine as the gate shifts in its frame. Then a sharp *clack* as something on the stair side slips. A Saints voice carries down, closer than it should be: “They’re in—move!”

That means the gate didn’t hold long enough to be a wall. It held long enough to be a delay.

The key-pin man reaches the hard left turn—the “pinch”—and flattens himself to the brick to slide through. It’s tight: one shoulder at a time, rail iron close to your boots, brick biting at coat buttons. He gets through and immediately hisses, “Single file—don’t—” then cuts himself off as something splashes ahead.

You hear it too: water, disturbed—knee-deep or not, something *moved* in it. Not the river’s lazy shift. A step. Maybe two.

The shotgun woman freezes at the mouth of the pinch, lantern slit aimed low. The light catches ripples and the shine of wet brick beyond the drop—nothing else, no face, no body, just motion fading.

Rook edges Sable up behind you, whispering, “Eve… there’s somebody down there.”

Threats, clear: Saints are now in the tunnel behind you and closing; ahead, past the pinch and the three-foot drop, there’s an unseen presence in the sluice run—close enough to have just moved in the water.

#### Turn 66 **[PLAYER]**

I press in close at the pinch, voice low but hard. “Hey—down in the water. Say your name or I start assuming you’re Saints.”

I tap the shotgun woman’s arm and point her muzzle past my hip toward the drop. “Cover that sluice—don’t fire unless you see a face.” Then I lean to the key-pin man, keys in his hand. “If that second gate’s real, you find it and you get it open—now.”

To Rook, I hook two fingers at Sable’s collar. “Keep him up here with me till we know what’s down there—if we drop blind, he’s dead.” I angle my ear back toward the tunnel, listening for bootfalls, and whisper, “If they’re close, we jump anyway.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re squeezed between Saints behind and an unknown presence ahead; I need to buy seconds, identify friend or foe, and keep Sable from going down. I’ll use voice and light discipline to probe the sluice while positioning the shotgun to cover, and push key-pin to open the next gate fast.*

#### Turn 67 **[GAME]**

Your voice hits the sluice like a stone dropped in a well. For a beat there’s only the drip of water and the faint hiss of your own breath.

Then, from below the three-foot lip, a man answers—quiet, strained, close.

“Name’s Niall,” he says. “Don’t shoot. I’m not Saints.”

The lantern slit catches him as he edges a fraction into view: a pale cheekbone, a hand braced on wet brick, fingers splayed to keep balance. He’s down in the water, knee-deep like the key-pin man said, coat dark with soak. No Saints armband. No union pin. But he’s got a small revolver in his right hand, held low along his thigh like he doesn’t want to show it and can’t afford not to have it.

The shotgun woman shifts her stance exactly like you told her—muzzle covering the drop, finger outside the trigger guard. She doesn’t fire. She does say, flat: “Drop it in the water, Niall.”

Niall’s jaw works. He doesn’t drop it. “If I drop it, I’m dead,” he whispers back. “If you shoot me, you’re dead too. They’re behind you.”

That’s when the sound behind you changes from distant pursuit to near certainty: bootfalls, multiple, slapping puddles and rail iron. A cough, then a barked order that bounces down the tunnel: “Light! I saw light—move!”

The key-pin man doesn’t wait for more permission. He slips past you through the pinch, keys clenched, and you hear him splash down into the sluice. He lands awkwardly with a wet grunt, then starts wading left, feeling along the wall with his free hand. Metal scrapes—his keys searching for a keyway you can’t see from above.

Rook keeps Sable pinned up at the lip with you like you ordered, one hand hooked under Sable’s collar to keep his head from lolling forward. Sable sways, eyes unfocused, breathing loud in the tight brick.

Niall stays in the water, half-turned between you and the direction the key-pin man went, as if he’s guarding that path—or trapped by it.

Immediate threats are now split and concrete:
- The Saints are within seconds of the pinch; their voices are close enough you can hear individual breaths between coughs.
- At the drop, you’ve got an armed man (Niall) in the sluice who refuses to disarm, and your key-pin man is exposed in the water trying to find and open a second gate you haven’t confirmed yet.

#### Turn 68 **[PLAYER]**

I bare my teeth down at Niall. “Fine—keep your pea-shooter, but you point it *past* me and you don’t twitch, or she’ll take your head off.”

I jerk my chin at the shotgun woman. “Hold the pinch—one shot if you see a face, then fall back. Don’t let ‘em bunch up on us.”  

To Rook, I grip Sable’s collar with him. “On three we drop him—keep his chin up, keep his mouth out of the water.” I call low toward the key-pin man in the dark, “Find that lock—NOW!” and then I start the count, already bracing to jump with Sable into the sluice.

*Agent reasoning: We can’t hold the pinch with Sable half-dead, and arguing with Niall wastes seconds. I’ll force a temporary truce, keep the shotgun trained, and get everyone down into the sluice to push for the second gate before the Saints reach us.*

#### Turn 69 **[GAME]**



#### Turn 70 **[PLAYER]**

I hiss, “Three—two—one,” and with Rook I drop Sable down into the sluice, keeping his chin tipped up and his face out of the water. I slide down after, boots splashing, and snap at Niall, “Gun stays low and away—prove you’re not Saints by covering our back.”

*Agent reasoning: Saints are seconds away; the pinch won’t hold long. I don’t trust Niall, but we can’t afford a standoff—get Sable down, keep his airway clear, and force the key-pin man to make that second gate real while the shotgun woman buys us a heartbeat.*

#### Turn 71 **[GAME]**

Sable goes over the lip on your count—Rook and you lower him more than drop him, but he still hits the sluice with a hard splash that soaks his coat up to the ribs. His head lolls once; you wrench his chin up in time, keeping his mouth clear. He coughs—thin, ugly—and swallows river-stink instead of water.

You slide down after him. Your boots hit knee-deep cold and the shock bites straight through leather. The splash is loud in the tight brick.

Up at the pinch, the shotgun woman plants herself sideways to make a narrow target, barrel aimed up-tunnel. A lantern beam—full this time, not a slit—flares from the Saints’ side and paints her silhouette. A voice yells, “There—!”

She fires once. The shotgun blast turns the tunnel into a thunder box. You hear a man scream and something heavy hit the rails. The lantern light wobbles and drops out of sight, replaced by frantic shadows and shouting.

“Fall back!” she snaps, and she backs through the pinch after you, boots scraping brick, keeping the muzzle trained until the last second.

Down in the sluice, Niall does what you demanded—he shifts his revolver to point past you, up toward the pinch, arm low and locked. “I’m not Saints,” he says again, and this time it sounds like anger, not pleading. “They took my brother.”

The key-pin man is a dark shape farther left, waterline at his thighs as the floor dips. You hear him curse under his breath, then the scrape of metal on metal—key against a hidden plate. “Got it,” he whispers urgently. “Door’s here—chalk mark was true—”

A sudden rattle answers him: not a lock turning yet, but a chain on the far side being yanked taut, like someone’s holding the door shut from within.

The key-pin man freezes with the key half-seated. “Someone’s on the other side,” he says, voice tight. “Holding it.”

Behind you, at the pinch, Saints boots hit the brick choke point—close. You hear them bunching, swearing, dragging someone back from the blast. A hard voice cuts through: “Flush ’em out. Down into the water—now!”

Threats, immediate and specific:
- Saints are at the pinch and about to force through into the sluice.
- The “second gate” exists, but it’s being held shut from the far side by an unseen person; the key-pin man can’t open it yet.
- Sable is in the water and barely conscious; if you get jostled or submerged, he’ll drown fast.

#### Turn 72 **[PLAYER]**

I shove Sable against the wall with Rook, my palm under his jaw. “Hold him up—don’t let his face dip, not for a second.”

I wade hard toward the key-pin man and bark low through the crack, “Whoever’s on the other side—open up unless you want Saints pouring in here with you!” Then, quieter but sharp at the key-pin man, “If they don’t answer, you turn that key anyway—break the chain, break their wrist, I don’t care.”

Over my shoulder at Niall and the shotgun woman: “Cover the pinch—make ’em pay for every step. If they drop in, shoot the first one and drown the rest.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re about to be bottled in from behind, so I need that door—either talk whoever’s holding it or force their hands—while keeping Sable breathing. I’ll gamble on a quick parley and use the Saints as leverage.*

#### Turn 73 **[GAME]**



#### Turn 74 **[PLAYER]**

I jam Sable’s shoulder to the wall and keep my hand under his jaw. “Rook—hold him up. If his face dips, we’re done.”

I wade to the key-pin man and shout through the seam, “Open it! Saints are right behind us—unless you want them in there with you.” Then I lean close, voice like a blade: “No answer? Turn it anyway. Break the chain, break their wrist—just get it open.”

Over my shoulder to Niall and the shotgun woman: “Pinch is yours—make ’em pay for every step. First one in the water dies.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re seconds from being overrun; the only way out is that held door, so I’ll intimidate whoever’s bracing it while the others keep the choke point lethal.*

#### Turn 75 **[GAME]**

Rook hauls Sable upright against the slick brick, forearm under his armpits like a hook. Your palm stays under Sable’s jaw, forcing his chin up. Sable’s eyelids flutter; he makes a wet, involuntary sound and sags heavier. Rook grits, “Got him—don’t let go,” and shifts his stance to keep Sable’s face angled away from the black water.

You wade to the chalk-marked door. The seam is hair-thin, but it leaks a colder draft than the tunnel air. When you shout, there’s a beat of dead silence—then a voice, close on the other side, low and panicked: “Don’t—don’t open it. They’ll use it. They’ll—”

A second sound answers: a fist or shoulder slamming the door from within, bracing it. The chain on the far side snaps taut again with a metallic shriek.

The key-pin man’s jaw tightens. “That’s not Saints,” he mutters—more to himself than you—then he sets the marrow-white key and turns hard.

Metal protests. The lock gives a fraction—enough to bite skin. A sharp yelp erupts from the other side as the chain jerks and something—someone’s wrist, by the sound of it—gets crushed between link and ring.

But the door still doesn’t open. The chain holds.

From the pinch, the shotgun woman fires again—closer this time, muzzle flash strobing brick. A Saints man screams; you hear a body splash in shallow water up-tunnel. Niall barks, “Stay back!” and fires twice, low, toward legs.

Then a bottle arcs through the choke point and shatters against the brick lip with a glassy crack. A heartbeat later, flames race across the surface of the sluice water in a thin, hungry sheet—someone tossed a firebomb, and the spill is carrying it toward you.

“FIRE—!” the shotgun woman yells, stumbling back from the pinch as heat rolls down the tunnel.

Immediate threats, clear:
- The sluice water is burning, the flame front skimming toward the door and toward Rook/Sable.
- Saints are still forcing the pinch; they’re using fire now.
- The door remains chained from inside; forcing it further is injuring whoever’s bracing it, but it hasn’t broken yet.

#### Turn 76 **[PLAYER]**

I whip my coat off and slap it down on the burning surface, sweeping hard to smother a path. “Rook—drag Sable higher on the wall, keep his face up! Shotgun—fall back, use your coat, stamp it out!”

I slam my palm against the door seam, voice raw. “Listen to me—if you keep that chain on, you burn with us. Unhook it, NOW, and we’ll hold the Saints out here!”

To the key-pin man, I shove in close. “When it loosens, you crank—don’t stop.” Then I snap at Niall, eyes on the pinch. “You—cover the firebomb hand. Put one in the next arm that throws glass.”

*Agent reasoning: Fire on the water means we’ve got seconds; the only way out is that chained door, but there’s a scared civilian bracing it. I’ll try to get them to release the chain while we smother flames and keep Sable breathing—no heroics, just ugly urgency.*

#### Turn 77 **[GAME]**

Your coat hits the burning skin of liquor-slick water with a wet slap. For half a second it works—flame gutters and coughs out under the wool where you press it. You sweep hard, carving a dark, steaming lane toward the door.

Then the coat drinks the fuel. Heat blooms through it fast. The edge nearest the pinch flares up and the sleeve catches; you feel the scorch lick your knuckles as you shove it forward anyway. The path stays open—but only as long as you keep moving it, and your coat is starting to burn.

Behind you, Rook drags Sable higher, shoulder scraping brick. He wedges Sable’s limp body against a protruding mortar seam and keeps Sable’s chin tilted up with one hand. “He’s breathing—barely,” Rook spits, fighting panic.

The shotgun woman retreats from the pinch, boots splashing through firelight. She tears her own coat off, drops to a knee, and starts beating at the flame’s leading edge. “Keep it off the wall!” she yells, stamping. The fire hisses but keeps crawling around her efforts in thin tongues.

You slam the door seam. The voice on the other side comes back, strained and close, like they’re pressing their cheek to wood. “You don’t understand—if I unhook it, they’ll—” A sharp intake of breath. “My hand—Jesus—”

The key-pin man grinds the key again when you crowd him. The lock turns another fraction with a brutal jerk. From the far side: a choked scream and the clatter of the chain shifting—one link slips.

Not off. Not yet. But it *moves*.

At the pinch, Niall leans out past the shotgun woman’s shoulder, eyes hard. A Saints silhouette lifts an arm with another bottle—rag burning bright. Niall fires once. The bottle drops from nerveless fingers and shatters at their feet; flame whooshes up the Saints side of the choke and you hear men stumble back, swearing.

But it buys seconds, not safety. A Saints voice barks orders over the roar: “Smoke ’em! Push through—now!”

A new threat rolls in with it: gray smoke starts to billow from the pinch as something smolders and is shoved toward the opening—thickening the air and heading straight down the tunnel toward you, low and choking, riding above the fire-skim.

Your coat is actively burning at the edges in your hands; the door chain has shifted one link; and the Saints are switching from fire to smoke to force you off the door.

#### Turn 78 **[PLAYER]**

I fling my burning coat down into the sluice to die in the water and clamp my sleeve over my nose. “Rook—keep Sable’s face up and yours down, breathe through cloth!”

I press my mouth to the seam, voice low and vicious with fear. “They’re smoking us out. Unhook the chain or you’re dead in a minute—choose.” Then I hook my fingers into the crack and yank, trying to steal slack.

To the key-pin man: “Crank it—now—don’t be gentle!” And to Niall and the shotgun woman, coughing: “Fall back slow—shots only. If they rush the pinch, you dump them in the fire.”

*Agent reasoning: The smoke will choke us off the door and the fire’s eating my coat; we need that chain off now, even if it means hurting the person inside—then slam it behind us before the Saints push through.*

#### Turn 79 **[GAME]**



#### Turn 80 **[PLAYER]**

I fling my burning coat into the sluice and clamp my sleeve over my nose. “Rook—keep Sable’s face up and yours down, breathe through cloth!”

I press my mouth to the seam, voice low and shaking mean. “They’re smoking us out. Unhook the chain or you die with us—choose.” I hook my fingers into the crack and yank for slack.

To the key-pin man: “Crank it—now—don’t be gentle!” Then, coughing over my shoulder at Niall and the shotgun: “Fall back slow—shots only. If they rush the pinch, dump ’em into the fire.”

*Agent reasoning: Smoke will drop us before bullets do; the only way out is getting that chain off or ripping the door free, so I’ll bully the person inside while forcing slack and keeping the others from panicking.*

#### Turn 81 **[GAME]**



#### Turn 82 **[PLAYER]**

I gag into my sleeve and shove my fingers deeper into the seam, yanking for any slack. “Unhook it—NOW!” I snap at the key-pin man, “Crank till it screams,” then throw my weight into the door as Niall and the shotgun woman fall back, firing only when a Saints arm shows in the pinch.

*Agent reasoning: The smoke and fire are closing in; I can’t afford finesse. I’ll force the door/chain while keeping our line from collapsing, and I’ll try to get whoever’s inside to commit before we all choke.*

#### Turn 83 **[GAME]**

Your fingers find the chain through the seam—cold metal, wet with somebody else’s sweat. You hook a knuckle under a link and yank. The door gives a fraction, enough to bite your fingertips and draw a sharp line of pain, but it *does* steal slack—just a breath of it.

On the other side, the unseen person makes a strangled sound. “Stop—my wrist—” The chain scrapes. Another link shifts. You hear the hook itself rattle against the staple like teeth chattering.

“Now!” you snarl, and the key‑pin man answers with action, not words. He plants his feet in the slick grit and cranks the key like he’s trying to break it off in the lock. Metal complains—high, ugly. Something inside the mechanism *pops*.

The door jumps inward a half inch.

It’s enough.

The chain hook slips free with a sharp clack and whips back. The door swings just wide enough to make a black wedge of space—and a hand shoots out, groping, fingers raw and red like they’ve been worrying at the chain for too long.

Smoke hits you in a thick, oily wave from the pinch behind—Saints have shoved something smoldering up into the choke. It’s not just haze now; it’s a rolling, low cloud that claws at your throat and makes your eyes flood.

At the pinch, Niall does exactly what you said: he waits until a Saints forearm reaches through the fireline, then fires once. The arm jerks back; a man yelps. The shotgun woman backs step by step, muzzle level, and when a shape commits to the rush she fires a single blast that knocks it sideways into the burning spill. You hear fabric catch and a scream turn immediately to wet coughing.

But the Saints don’t stop. Boots slap water. Someone on their side starts dragging a heavy object forward—metal scraping stone—using it like a shield against the heat and bullets.

At the door, the person inside finally gets their shoulder into it. The gap widens to a foot. You can slip through—single file, fast. The key‑pin man, face slick with sweat, hisses, “Move. Move!”

Rook is already hauling Sable off the wall, trying to keep Sable’s head lolling back. “Eve—he’s going blue,” he says, voice tight with terror, and staggers toward the opening as the smoke curls around your knees and rises.

#### Turn 84 **[PLAYER]**

I grab Sable’s collar and shoulder to help Rook, hauling him through the gap first. “Inside—now! Whoever’s in there, pull him!”  

As soon as Sable’s weight clears, I twist back, coughing, and bark at Niall and the shotgun woman, “One more shot each, then through—don’t get heroic!” I snatch up whatever loose junk I can reach near the door—brick, pipe, anything—and fling it low at the Saints’ advancing shield to make them stumble into their own fire before I duck in after the others.

*Agent reasoning: We’ve got seconds before smoke and a shielded rush swallow us; Sable won’t make it if we waste time. I’ll prioritize getting Sable through, then buy the others a heartbeat by slowing the Saints at the pinch.*

#### Turn 85 **[GAME]**

Rook lurches with Sable’s dead weight, and you get a fistful of collar and shoulder. Together you half-drag, half-throw him into the opening. Sable’s boots catch the threshold; his head lolled back, lips dark. The hand from inside clamps onto Sable’s forearm and *yanks* with surprising strength.

You get a look at who’s on the other side: a man in shirtsleeves with a torn cuff, wrist rubbed raw to the meat where the chain had been. Not Saints—wrong kind of panic. He grits out, “Give him—” and hauls Sable deeper into the dark.

You whirl back and shout your order. Niall nods once—no argument—eyes streaming.

The Saints’ “shield” comes into view through the smoke: a dock cart turned on its side, iron rim scraping, two men pushing it low like a battering ram. Heat ripples around it; the firelight makes their faces look carved and wrong.

You snatch what your hand finds: a broken brick and a short length of rusted pipe near the chalk-marked jamb. You fling them low.

The brick skitters on wet stone and slams into the cart’s leading rim. One pusher’s boot slips; his knee drops hard. The pipe catches a shin with a dull, meaty thunk—he yelps and stumbles sideways, shoulder bumping his partner. The cart slews just enough that its edge kisses the burning spill.

Grease or liquor—whatever’s feeding the flame—licks up the cart’s wood. It catches fast. The Saints bark in alarm, trying to shove it back, but now they’re wrestling something that’s *on fire*.

Niall fires his last careful shot at a face that peeks around the cart; the man snaps back with a wet cry. The shotgun woman fires once—too close to the burning spill—and the blast showers sparks and splinters; a Saints coat sleeve flashes into flame.

Then a new sound: a revolver cracking from deeper in the smoke, not from the pinch. A bullet smacks the brick by your head, chips stinging your cheek. Someone’s flanking the choke.

The shirt-sleeved man inside the door snarls, “NOW, GIRL!” and reaches out for you as the smoke drops thicker and the cart’s fire throws wild light across the gap.

#### Turn 86 **[PLAYER]**

I duck low from the flanker’s line, grab the shirt-sleeved man’s wrist and let him yank me in hard. “Niall—Shotgun—MOVE!” I rasp, then slam my shoulder into the door from inside, fumbling for the chain or any bolt, eyes hunting for something heavy to jam it shut.

*Agent reasoning: A flanker means staying outside is suicide; I need Niall and the shotgun through, but I won’t leave them—buy a heartbeat, then dive inside and get that door shut.*

#### Turn 87 **[GAME]**

You go low and grab the man’s wrist. He doesn’t pull gentle—he *rips* you through the gap by sheer panic and strength. Your shoulder clips the jamb; pain blooms down your arm. Behind you, the flanker’s revolver cracks again. The shot doesn’t follow you in—too tight an angle—but it hammers the door edge with a hard *thwack*, sending a splintering spray into the dark.

“Niall—Shotgun—MOVE!” you rasp, and you hear them answer with boots, not words: a sprinting slap through puddles, then the scrape of bodies squeezing the gap.

You slam your shoulder into the door from inside. It swings most of the way—then stops short with a violent jolt. Something is wedged in the threshold: the dock cart’s iron rim, shoved into place from the other side as the Saints recover and think faster than they panic. The door can’t close flush; it’s held open three inches, a thin black mouth breathing smoke.

You fumble for the chain—find it hanging loose, hook swinging. No bolt. Just the tired lock and the chain hardware you already beat.

The shirtsleeved man—face gray, eyes wild—barks, “They’ll pry it—help me!” and throws his weight into the door anyway, trying to crush the cart rim back out. The gap trembles but holds.

Niall and the shotgun woman spill in behind you, coughing hard. Niall’s sleeve is singed; the shotgun woman’s hair smells burnt. She spins immediately, plants her shoulder beside yours, and shoves. “Something’s in it,” she snaps, voice rough.

Through the three-inch gap you see Saints boots and the glow of fire. A hand snakes in, groping for the chain hook, fingers quick and practiced. Then steel scrapes: someone outside is levering the cart rim with a crowbar, trying to widen the opening.

Inside the basement, your eyes catch what you can use: a heavy cast-iron valve wheel bolted to a pipe run along the wall; a crate of brick offcuts; and, deeper back, a low workbench with a vise. None of it is in your hands yet.

The immediate threat is clear: the Saints have the door pinned with the cart rim and are working a pry bar to force it wider, while a flanker with a revolver has your side of the corridor covered if the gap opens.

#### Turn 88 **[PLAYER]**

I grab two brick offcuts and cram them into the three-inch gap hard, aiming to pinch that reaching hand—then I snarl at the shirtsleeves, “Hold it—keep your weight!”  

Over my shoulder to the shotgun woman: “Cover the crack—if a face shows, take it.” Then to Niall, coughing, “Get that valve wheel off the pipe—anything heavy, now!”

*Agent reasoning: We can’t win a tug-of-war with a crowbar; we need to jam the gap fast and make it hurt to reach in. Bricks are quickest, and the valve wheel might come off as a club if we get a second.*

#### Turn 89 **[GAME]**

You snatch two brick offcuts from the crate and drop to the gap. The reaching hand is there again—fingers hunting for the chain hook, knuckles white in the firelight.

You slam the first brick into the three-inch mouth. It wedges with a gritty crunch. The second brick follows, harder—your palm stings from the impact—and you drive it in like a doorstop.

The Saints’ hand is a half-second too slow.

Brick bites finger. There’s a sharp, involuntary yelp from outside, and the hand jerks back leaving a smear of blood on the pale edge of the offcut. The gap narrows to a mean, jagged slit—still breathing smoke, but less.

“Hold it—keep your weight!” you snarl, and the shirtsleeved man throws himself against the door with you, shoulder and hip, shaking with effort. The door shudders as the crowbar outside tries to lever again; the bricks grind but don’t pop free.

Over your shoulder the shotgun woman steps in close, barrels angled at the slit. “Show me a cheek,” she mutters, and keeps the muzzle steady, waiting.

Niall staggers to the pipe run, hacking once, then gets both hands on the cast-iron valve wheel. He tries to spin it—nothing. He plants a boot on the pipe for leverage and yanks. The wheel doesn’t come off; it’s bolted and seized with rust. Metal squeals. “It’s married to the damn pipe!” he coughs.

Outside, the Saints change tactics. You hear shouted orders muffled by smoke and the crackle of the burning cart. The crowbar stops prying and starts *hammering*—a heavy, rhythmic thud against the door edge, trying to jar the bricks loose and split the jamb. Each hit makes the door jump against your shoulder and sends dust and old plaster raining down.

Then the flanker’s revolver barks again from the side corridor. The shot punches through the doorframe near the slit—wood splinters spray inward and one shard slices your cheekbone. The shotgun woman flinches but holds her aim.

The threat is immediate and concrete: the Saints are battering the door to shake your brick wedges free while a flanker is firing into the crack and frame, trying to force you off the door so they can pry it open.

#### Turn 90 **[PLAYER]**

I spit blood, press my cheek to my shoulder, and hiss, “Stop shooting the crack—shoot the *hand* if it comes back.”  

To Niall: “Forget the wheel—rip that pipe with the wheel still on it, or grab the vise off the bench. I need weight.”  

I snatch a third brick and shove it up against the slit like a plug, then yell to shirtsleeves, “On three—we slam it shut and brace it. One—two—THREE!” and drive my whole body into the door, trying to crush the cart rim back while the shotgun woman stays trained on the opening.

*Agent reasoning: The door won’t hold long under hammering and the flanker’s rounds; we need to kill the line of sight at the slit and brace the door with something heavier than my shoulder. The workbench vise and that pipe run can give us leverage and weight, and I want the shotgun covering while we rig it.*

#### Turn 91 **[GAME]**



#### Turn 92 **[PLAYER]**

I wipe the blood from my lip with my sleeve and grit, “Don’t waste lead on the crack—if a hand comes in, take the fingers.”  

“Niall—wheel’s a lost cause. Grab the vise off that bench or tear the pipe loose with it still on—I need weight!”  

I jam a third brick into the slit like a plug, then snap at shirtsleeves, “On three we slam it and brace—ONE—TWO—THREE!” and throw my whole shoulder and hip into the door, trying to crush the cart rim back while the shotgun woman keeps her barrels trained on the opening.

*Agent reasoning: They’re battering the door and the flanker’s shots are chewing the frame; I need to keep pressure, deny them the slit, and get something heavy to brace before the jamb gives.*

#### Turn 93 **[GAME]**

You wipe the blood and jam the third brick into the slit. It goes in crooked—more plug than wedge—scraping loudly as it grinds against the door edge.

“Fingers,” the shotgun woman repeats, flat. She shifts her stance so the barrels point at the *inside* edge of the gap, not the darkness beyond.

Niall abandons the valve wheel with a cough and lunges for the workbench. The vise is bolted down. He tries to heave it anyway—bench legs shriek across the concrete a few inches. “It’s fixed!” he spits, then grabs the bench itself by the corner, knuckles whitening.

“One—two—THREE!”

You and shirtsleeves hit the door together—shoulder, hip, full weight. The door slams inward against the cart rim with a brutal jolt. For a heartbeat it feels like it might give—

Outside, the Saints answer with muscle. The cart rim screeches as it’s shoved *back* into the threshold. The gap doesn’t close; it *changes shape*. Your bricks bite deeper, and the crooked third brick cracks with a sharp snap, spitting grit into your eyes.

Then the crowbar returns—not prying now, but stabbing. The hooked end punches into the gap and catches the brick edge. Someone outside yanks hard.

The brick plug tears free and shoots into the room, spinning. It clips shirtsleeves on the temple with a dull *thunk*. He staggers, knees dipping, but he doesn’t fully go down—just blinks stupidly and groans, weight sloughing off the door for an instant.

That instant is enough.

The Saints lever again and the gap widens from a slit to a four-inch bite. A hand darts in—fast, blood-smeared fingers reaching to grab the chain hardware.

The shotgun woman fires once. The blast is deafening in the basement. Pellets shred the reaching hand at the wrist; fingers vanish in a spray that paints the brick and door edge dark. The hand jerks back with a scream that turns into a wet howl.

But the shot also blows more of the door edge apart. Fresh splinters and a chunk of jamb explode inward, and now the opening is ugly and larger—big enough for a crowbar to work and, soon, a face to risk it.

Niall, eyes watering from smoke and dust, drags the whole workbench toward you instead of the vise. The bench scrapes loud as a confession. “This’ll have to do!” he hacks out.

Immediate threat: the door is still pinned by the cart rim, but the jamb is breaking down under crowbar work and gunfire; the gap is widening, and the Saints are seconds from forcing it enough to push a weapon—or a man—through.

#### Turn 94 **[PLAYER]**

“Bench—here, tight to the door!” I bark, grabbing the edge with Niall and ramming it sideways into the jamb like a brace. “Shotgun, stay on that hole—if steel shows, blow it off.”

I hook an arm under shirtsleeves’ shoulder to shove him back into the door with me, then hiss in his ear, “Name. And if you want to live, you push.”

*Agent reasoning: The door won’t hold on muscle alone; we need a solid brace fast and I can’t let that opening widen enough for a gun or head. Use the workbench as a barricade and keep pressure while shifting to a safer position.*

#### Turn 95 **[GAME]**

You and Niall get your hands under the bench lip and bull it across the concrete. It catches on a floor crack, jolts, then slides—legs shrieking—until you slam it sideways into the doorframe. Niall wedges his shoulder behind it and you both shove: bench edge to jamb, bench legs braced wide like a stubborn animal.

The next crowbar hit from outside lands—and instead of the door flexing, the whole frame shudders into the bench. The brace *holds*. Splinters still rain, but the gap stops widening for the moment.

The shotgun woman stays planted, cheek to stock, barrels aimed at the opening. Smoke curls around her hair. “Steel shows, it’s gone,” she says, and you can hear she means it.

You hook an arm under shirtsleeves’ shoulder and haul him back into the press. He’s dazed from the brick strike, but pain and panic sharpen him when you hiss in his ear.

“Name,” you demand. “And if you want to live, you push.”

He swallows hard, eyes glassy, then grits his teeth and leans his weight into the door with you. “Tommy,” he rasps. “Tommy Coyle—Jesus—”

Outside, the Saints realize the pry isn’t buying them much. The crowbar stops. You hear boots reposition on wet stone, a low argument, then a sharp whistle—signal, not panic.

A new sound answers: glass crunching somewhere to your left, deeper in the basement corridor you came through—slow, deliberate footsteps on debris, not running. Someone’s coming around the long way, using another entry.

The immediate threats split:
1) At the door, the Saints are regrouping, likely preparing a harder breach (more tools, more bodies, or fire).
2) In the interior corridor, a flanker is closing in from behind you—close enough now that you can hear their breathing through the smoke and the scrape of a shoe sole testing each step.

{"npcs_add":["Tommy Coyle (shirtsleeved captive)"]}

#### Turn 96 **[PLAYER]**

I clamp Tommy harder against the bench and snarl, “Stay glued here, Tommy—if you slip, we all die.”  

Then I call sharp to the shotgun woman without looking away from the corridor, “Swing your barrels left—one look, one shot. Niall, keep that bench married to the jamb.”  

I grab a loose brick chunk and whip it down the corridor into the dark, aiming for the footsteps. “Hey—Saint! Come get your teeth!”

*Agent reasoning: We’re about to get pinched—door in front, flanker behind. I don’t want to abandon the brace, but we need eyes and a threat pointed down that corridor; I’ll peel the shotgun off the door for a second and use Tommy as leverage to keep the bench set.*

#### Turn 97 **[GAME]**

You clamp Tommy in place. He wheezes, eyes wide, and digs his heels in harder against the concrete. “I’m here—I’m here,” he breathes, more to himself than you.

Niall keeps the bench jammed tight, forearms shaking with the strain. The doorframe thumps once from the other side—testing—then stills.

The shotgun woman pivots left on your call, barrels tracking the corridor mouth. She doesn’t rush the shot; she sets, waits, muzzle steady.

You snatch a jagged chunk of brick and whip it down the corridor.

It hits something with a hard *crack*—not a wall. A grunt answers, sharp and involuntary. The footsteps stop dead.

Then a voice comes back, close enough you can place it in the darkness: “Cute.”

A shape shifts at floor level. Not a man standing—someone crouched. A faint metallic clink follows, like a tool kissing concrete.

The shotgun woman fires into the corridor on the first glimpse of movement—one booming shot that lights the hall for an instant.

In that flash you see him: a Saints man low and sideways behind a scavenged door panel or sheet of something—thin cover, maybe a busted locker face—held like a shield. The blast punches splinters and metal flakes off it and forces him back, but it doesn’t drop him.

He answers immediately: not with a gunshot, but with a thrown object that skitters and rolls—small, dark, fast.

It bounces once and lands near the bench by the braced door.

A glass bottle. Rag stuffed in the neck.

The rag is already burning.

Niall sees it and yelps, reflexively lifting one foot away as if the flame could bite through leather. Tommy flinches, his weight wavering for a half-second—just enough that the bench creaks and the door gives a fraction of an inch.

From the other side of the door, the Saints *feel* that give. Something heavy slams into the wood—shoulder or boot—trying to capitalize.

You now have two immediate, concrete threats:
- A lit Molotov bottle burning on the floor within a few feet of the bench and door brace, about to spread flame and smoke in this tight room.
- The Saints at the door have resumed ramming, the brace momentarily compromised by Niall’s and Tommy’s flinch.

#### Turn 98 **[PLAYER]**

“Don’t you dare flinch,” I snap at Niall and Tommy, shoving my shoulder into the bench to steady it. 

I dart my foot out and hook-kick the burning bottle hard back down the corridor toward the crouched Saint, shouting, “Catch!” Then I bark to the shotgun woman, “Again—shoot his legs when he peeks!”

*Agent reasoning: Fire in a basement is a death sentence; I need it out or away immediately without losing the brace. I’ll kick/throw the bottle back down the corridor and keep Niall/Tommy anchored, while the shotgun keeps the flanker pinned.*

#### Turn 99 **[GAME]**

You slam your shoulder into the bench and it bites back into the jamb with a groan of wood and iron. Niall swallows his panic and re-braces, jaw clenched. Tommy squeezes his eyes shut and leans in again, shaking but present.

Your foot hooks under the bottle’s belly and you kick hard.

The bottle skids and spins down the corridor, flame trailing off the rag like a comet tail. It goes farther than you expect—then clips the edge of the Saints man’s makeshift shield and bursts.

Glass pops like teeth. Fire blossoms low and wide, licking along the floor and up the shield’s face. The crouched Saint jerks back with a strangled curse, losing the shield as it catches. You hear him scramble, boots scraping, patting at his sleeve.

But the throwback isn’t clean for you, either: the bottle’s burst splashes burning liquor in a fan that reaches the corridor mouth and spits into the room in scattered tongues. A line of fire crawls toward the bench leg, eating dust and whatever spilled spirits are on the concrete.

The shotgun woman takes your order and fires again the moment she sees him recoil—aimed low.

This time the blast catches him. You hear a wet impact and a howl that turns into a choking sob. He collapses out of view, dragging himself with his elbows, leaving a dark smear on the floor that the fire tries to follow.

At the braced door, the Saints ram again—harder, coordinated. The bench shudders; a leg skates half an inch on the slick concrete. Nails squeal. The jamb splits further with a loud crack, and the gap at the door edge opens enough for cold fog to push through in a steady breath.

Immediate threats, clear and present:
- Fire is spreading along the floor near the corridor mouth and is close to catching the bench leg and anything spilled nearby; smoke is beginning to thicken low.
- The Saints’ ramming is breaking the jamb despite the brace; you can feel the structure failing in increments, and the gap is now big enough that a tool or gun barrel could be shoved through at any moment.

#### Turn 100 **[PLAYER]**

I rip off my coat and drop low, whipping it over the crawling flames to smother them, grinding it down with my hands and knee. “Niall—Tommy—don’t move, don’t breathe big, just HOLD!”

I glance at the shotgun woman. “If a barrel comes through that gap, take it—then we run. Is there another way out back there, or are we dying cute in a broom closet?”

*Agent reasoning: Fire will eat our brace and smoke us out; the door won’t hold forever. I need to smother the flames fast and set up a last-ditch counter if they shove a weapon through the gap.*

#### Turn 101 **[GAME]**

You yank your coat off and slap it down over the crawling line of flame. The wool takes the first bite—singes instantly—but you grind it hard with your knee and both hands, smearing the fire flat against the concrete until it coughs and goes out in patches.

It works—mostly. The nearest tongues die, replaced by a greasy, sharp smoke that hugs the floor and makes your eyes water. But the coat is now smoldering in two spots, and you have to keep shifting your weight to choke those out before they re-bloom.

Behind you, Niall and Tommy hold the bench like it’s a lifeline. Niall’s voice comes out tight: “Holding—Christ—holding.”

The door shudders again. The jamb gives another ugly crack. The gap widens to a couple fingers.

A thin metal shape snakes into that gap—first the hooked end of a pry bar, probing for leverage. It scrapes along the inside edge, searching for the bench placement.

The shotgun woman steps in close, muzzle nearly kissing the gap. She doesn’t fire yet—too much wood, too much chance of ricochet into you—but she angles to catch whatever follows.

You shoot her the question.

She answers without looking away from the door: “Back there’s a utility run. Dead-ends into a workbench and a window—broken already. Too small for a clean exit unless you’re ready to bleed and crawl.” She pumps the shotgun once—calm, practiced. “Other way is through them.”

The pry bar suddenly yanks hard, trying to pull the bench off the jamb. The bench leg squeals and shifts a hair. Tommy grunts as the pressure changes; his feet skid but he recovers.

Then—worse—the Saints change tactics.

A pale hiss threads through the widening gap. Not fog.

Something acrid, chemical, and stinging rolls into the room at floor level. Your throat tightens immediately. Eyes start to burn. The Saints are feeding gas or smoke through the opening—something meant to flush you out, not break the door.

The threats are now immediate and specific:
- The pry bar is actively working the gap to unseat the bench brace.
- Irritant gas/smoke is entering through the door gap and beginning to impair breathing and sight in the room, especially low to the floor where you are.

#### Turn 102 **[PLAYER]**

I cough into my elbow, grab my half-burnt coat, and jam it hard into the gap like a gag—right over the hissing—then snarl at Niall, “Bench stays. Tommy—don’t you *dare* slide.”

I lean to the shotgun woman, eyes streaming. “Next time that bar shows, *take it*. Then we’re crawling—window run, now.”

*Agent reasoning: The gas will drop us fast if we stay pinned, and the pry bar will peel the bench away—our only chance is to stop the gap and then take the ugly crawl-out before we’re blind. I’ll use my smoldering coat as a seal and buy seconds with aggression at the pry bar while pushing the others toward the utility run.*

#### Turn 103 **[GAME]**

You lunge in with the coat and stuff it into the gap like you’re corking a bottle. The singed wool catches on splintered jamb and the pry bar’s scrape, but you shove until it wedges tight.

The hiss dulls immediately. Not gone—just choked down to a thin, angry whisper that leaks around the fabric. The stinging in your eyes eases a notch, but the room still holds what already got in; it burns in your throat every time you inhale.

On the other side, someone yanks at the pry bar. The hooked end saws against your coat, trying to pull it free. The bench shudders with each tug, but Niall locks his arms and grunts, “I got it—I got it,” like he’s trying to convince his own muscles.

Tommy’s boots slide a fraction on the slick concrete—then stop. He digs in, teeth bared, and forces his weight back into the wood. “Not—moving,” he rasp-coughs.

You hiss to the shotgun woman. She shifts to a knee, muzzle trained on the gap, waiting for metal.

The pry bar tip pokes through again, blindly stabbing for purchase.

She fires.

The blast is deafening in the cramped room. Wood explodes into splinters. The pry bar jerks like it’s been bitten and vanishes back through the gap with a clatter. A man outside screams—high and immediate—followed by a chorus of angry shouts.

But the shot also chews the door edge wider. Daylight-fog leaks in in a thicker ribbon now, and with it comes a renewed, stronger hiss as they shove whatever canister or hose they’ve got closer to the opening.

The shotgun woman snaps, “MOVE. Utility run—now!” She grabs Tommy by the collar with her free hand and hauls him off the bench.

The instant Tommy’s weight comes off, the bench skates. Niall tries to hold it alone; his boots slip and he nearly goes down. The door bucks inward a hard inch as the Saints slam it and the brace loses its perfect set.

You’ve bought seconds, not safety:
- The gas is starting to pour in again around the coat plug and new splinter gaps.
- The door is closer to giving; without both men bracing, another coordinated ram could break it.
- The utility run and broken window are still your only back route, but you’ll have to move through low smoke and stinging air to reach it.

#### Turn 104 **[PLAYER]**

“NIALL—leave it!” I shout, grabbing his sleeve and yanking him back from the bench before the next hit can pin him. 

I drop low, coughing, and shove Tommy ahead of me toward the utility run. “Move, Tommy—hands over your mouth, stay down!” 

To the shotgun woman, I rasp, “You’re rear—walk it back and pop anything that comes through. Tell me your name while we run, sweetheart—I’m tired of dying with strangers.”

*Agent reasoning: The door’s about to go and the gas will drop us if we hesitate; I need to pull Niall off that bench before he gets crushed, and keep the shotgun woman between us and the Saints while we take the ugly window route.*

#### Turn 105 **[GAME]**

You catch Niall by the sleeve and rip him off the bench just as the door takes another coordinated hit.

The bench skitters sideways, losing its bite. The door lurches inward with a crack like a snapped rib. The coat you jammed into the gap tears and slumps; the hiss turns into a steady pour. Acrid smoke/gas rolls in fast now, hugging the floor and climbing your legs in a cold, stinging tide.

Niall stumbles backward into you, coughing hard, eyes wide. “Okay—okay—” he manages, voice wrecked.

You shove Tommy ahead, forcing him low. He obeys, one hand clamped over his mouth, the other out in front like he’s feeling his way through a dark room. He’s shaking so bad his shoulder blades rattle under his shirt, but he moves.

The utility run is a narrower throat of concrete and pipes. You hit it on your knees, palms scraping grit, and immediately the air is marginally cleaner—still foul, but less concentrated than the room you left. Behind you, the Saints start yelling through the splintered doorway; boots hammer as they spill into the basement proper.

The shotgun woman backs into the run last, exactly as you asked—walking it back, barrel leveled down the corridor. She spits a cough, then answers your demand like it costs her nothing:

“Rosa,” she says. “Rosa Venn.”

A shadow breaks the doorway behind her—one of the Saints lunging into the basement, half-blind in the haze but moving on noise.

Rosa fires once, low.

The man drops out of sight with a meaty thud and a sharp, cut-off cry. The shotgun’s report slams off the concrete, and the recoil shoves her shoulder back into a pipe with a metallic clang. She grits her teeth, pumps the action, and keeps retreating.

But her shot gives them your route. You hear more boots now—several—spreading out, one voice barking, “They went down the pipe run!”

Ahead, the utility corridor tightens toward the broken window you were told about. You can already feel the draft from it—cold and damp—promising an exit that’s going to cost skin.

Immediate, concrete threats:
- Saints are in the basement and moving toward the utility run, now aware of your direction.
- Gas/smoke is pouring in behind you; it’s thinning in the run but still burning lungs and eyes.
- The only visible exit ahead is the broken window: small, jagged, and likely to cut badly if you rush it.

```json
{"npcs_add":["Rosa Venn"]}```

#### Turn 106 **[PLAYER]**

“Tommy, eyes on me—keep crawling, don’t look back,” I rasp, shoving him toward the draft. “Niall, you’re right behind him—hands on his boots if he freezes.”

I peel my scarf free and wrap it around my hand, then reach up to the broken window and start knocking the worst jagged teeth loose. “Rosa—give me ten seconds. Then you go through last and you don’t stop to be brave.”

I cough, spit, and glance back down the run. “How many shells you got left, Rosa?”

*Agent reasoning: The window’s our only out, and if we hesitate the Saints will bottle us in this pipe run; I’ll keep Tommy moving, use my scarf/whatever cloth to pad the glass, and coordinate Rosa and Niall so we don’t panic and jam the exit.*

#### Turn 107 **[GAME]**

Tommy keeps crawling because you make him. He tries to crane his head like a scared dog hearing a shout, and you shove him forward again; he swallows it and keeps his face down. Niall drops in behind him, one hand catching Tommy’s boot heel like an anchor. “Got you,” Niall coughs, and when Tommy’s pace stutters, Niall pushes him forward by the soles.

You wrap your scarf around your hand and go to work on the broken window. The glass teeth are old and mean—triangles stuck in putty, some loose, some stubborn. You knock two shards free; they tinkle down outside into puddles. A third piece refuses, and when you hit it harder it snaps wrong—your scarf takes the slice, but you feel a sting through the fabric and warmth starts to seep into the weave.

The draft is stronger up close: cold river air mixed with fog. The opening is just barely big enough for a body if you go sideways and commit.

Down the run, boots slap closer. Not just one pair—several, moving carefully now, the way men do when they know a gun is pointed at them. A voice barks, “Hold—hold—he’s got a scatter—”

Rosa plants herself at the bend, shoulders squared, shotgun steady, backing only when she has to. She doesn’t look at you when she answers.

“Two in the tube,” she says. “One more after that, in my pocket. If I can get to it.”

A shape edges into view at the far end—Saints man half-crouched, using the wall, trying to peek without giving Rosa a clean line. Behind him, another shadow flits, wider—someone with a longer gun or a club held low.

Rosa tracks the first peek with the muzzle, jaw tight. “Ten seconds,” she repeats, like she’s counting down to a door slam.

Your window work buys you a cleaner edge, but not clean: there are still jagged points along the top and one nasty fang on the right side. And the Saints are now close enough that if Rosa fires again, they’ll rush the moment she pumps—or they’ll throw something into the run.

No new gear comes free; your scarf is now blood-wet at the wrapped hand.

#### Turn 108 **[PLAYER]**

“Good—save ’em,” I hiss to Rosa, voice raw. “Don’t shoot unless you see a face you can’t miss.”

I grab Tommy by the collar and shove him up to the sill. “Sideways, kid—go. Don’t think, just *go*.” Then I hook Niall’s sleeve. “You’re next—keep a hand on him the whole way.”

I jam my scarf-wrapped hand over that nasty right-side fang and smash my elbow down on the top edge to knock anything loose, then bark, “Tommy out—Niall out—NOW!” and start hauling myself halfway through after them, eyes flicking back to Rosa. “Rosa—on my count, fire once and RUN. Three… two…”

*Agent reasoning: Rosa’s almost out of shells and they’re close enough to rush; we need bodies through the window now, and I can’t waste time perfecting the glass. I’ll make the opening “good enough,” get Tommy and Niall out, then coordinate a quick last shot and scramble with Rosa.*

#### Turn 109 **[GAME]**



#### Turn 110 **[PLAYER]**

“Good—save ’em,” I rasp at Rosa. “Don’t shoot unless you see a face you can’t miss.”

I shove Tommy up to the sill. “Sideways—go, kid. Don’t think, just *go*.” Then I grab Niall’s sleeve. “You’re next—keep a hand on him the whole way.”

I clamp my scarf-wrapped hand over that jagged fang, slam my elbow down on the top edge to break anything loose, and bark, “Tommy out—Niall out—NOW!” I start wriggling halfway through after them, eyes snapping back to Rosa. “Rosa—on my count, fire once and RUN. Three… two…”

*Agent reasoning: The window’s our only way out and the Saints are seconds away; I’ll force Tommy and Niall through first, then give Rosa a single covering shot cue and follow before we get rushed.*

#### Turn 111 **[GAME]**

Tommy goes. Not graceful—panicked. He turns sideways like you said, tries to duck, and the top edge bites his shoulder through his shirt with a tearing sound. He yelps, but momentum and fear carry him through. Outside, you hear him hit the wet ground hard and scramble, coughing.

Niall follows with one hand still on Tommy’s boot like it’s a promise. He wedges at the hips for a half-second—breath snagging, a freeze starting—then he forces himself, shoulders twisting. The jagged right-side fang scrapes his coat and skips off your scarf-wrapped hand instead. Niall drops outside with a grunt, then immediately reaches up, palms up, to guide you.

You clamp the scarf over the worst fang and slam your elbow down on the top edge. The concrete-and-putty lip sheds a few more shards—one skitters down your sleeve, another bounces off the sill and falls into the run. The opening’s a hair cleaner, but it’s still a butcher’s frame.

You start wriggling through. Half your torso is out into cold fog and rain; your ribs drag the sill. Something catches at your dress seam and tugs—hard—before it tears free with a rip that leaves fabric behind.

Behind you, Rosa hears your count and doesn’t wait for “one.” The Saints at the far end commit the moment they realize you’re going. One of them lunges around the bend, face exposed, teeth bared.

Rosa fires exactly once.

The blast fills the utility run with a flash and a wet, heavy impact. The man’s head snaps back and he folds out of view. Rosa pumps the shotgun—loud, final—and then she runs, boots slipping once on the damp concrete as she sprints toward the window.

But the Saints answer with something they didn’t need a clean shot for: a glass bottle clinks off pipe and explodes mid-run. A sheet of flame whooshes along the floor, chasing the gas and turning it into a fast, crawling fireline.

Heat punches your legs and the underside of the sill. The air turns instantly harsher—burning, oily.

Rosa hits the window just as you’re halfway through. “MOVE!” she barks, and she grabs the back of your dress and shoves—not gentle—trying to get you out before the fire reaches her boots.

Outside, Niall’s hands clamp your forearms, hauling. Rain hits your face like needles. You’re not out yet, but you’re moving—fast—while fire blooms behind Rosa in the run and the Saints’ boots thunder closer, now using the flame as cover to rush.

#### Turn 112 **[PLAYER]**

I kick hard to free my hips, twisting my shoulders and letting Niall haul me the rest of the way out; the moment I hit the mud I roll aside and cough, “Rosa—NOW, through! Drop the gun if you have to!”

I lunge back to the sill, grabbing for Rosa’s wrist/coat sleeve to yank her out, and snap at Niall, “Get Tommy moving—find cover, keep low!”

*Agent reasoning: I’m half-stuck and seconds from being cooked; I trust Niall to pull, and I need Rosa through before the fire and Saints hit the window. I’ll kick free, get out, then help Rosa and keep us moving into cover.*

#### Turn 113 **[GAME]**

Niall’s grip turns brutal with urgency. You kick, twist, and the snag gives with a final rip—your hips clear the sill and he hauls you down into the mud behind the warehouse wall. You hit hard, roll, and cough up damp air that tastes like soot anyway.

“Rosa—NOW!” you rasp.

At the window, Rosa is a silhouette against orange light. The fire in the run has reached the bend; it’s licking along the floor and up the lower pipes, fed by whatever’s leaking down there. The Saints’ boots are close enough now that you can hear breath and the wet slap of leather.

Rosa doesn’t drop the shotgun—she tries to bring it with her. She jams the barrel through first, then shoulders, but the weapon catches on the jagged sill and her coat snags at the same torn seam you left behind.

You lunge up and grab her sleeve. Your scarf-wrapped hand clamps her wrist; the other fist hooks fabric and yanks.

A Saints man appears at the bend, using the smoke and flame as cover. He’s got a revolver up, squinting through the heat shimmer. He fires once toward the window—wild but close. The bullet smacks brick just outside the frame, spitting a chip that cuts your cheek.

Rosa flinches, then commits. “To hell with it!” she snarls, and finally lets the shotgun go. It clatters back inside the run with a metallic bounce, immediately haloed by firelight.

With the weight gone, your pull works. Rosa scrapes through the glass mouth—hard. A shard rakes her forearm; blood flashes dark in the rain. Niall grabs her by the belt and drags, and the three of you tumble together into the mud.

Inside, a second shot cracks—another Saint firing blind at the window. The round punches into the frame and whistles out into the fog beyond.

Niall barks at Tommy, “MOVE!” and shoves him along the wall line. Tommy stumbles but runs, hunched, one hand clapped to his torn shoulder.

Rosa, breathing fast, clamps her bleeding arm with her other hand. “They’ll come out after us,” she says, eyes flicking to the window. Through the opening, the utility run is now a bright, breathing furnace—and you can hear men coughing, swearing, and repositioning to find the door or another way around.

The threat is immediate: Saints with firearms are seconds from either firing through the window again or spilling out from another exit to cut you off in the yard.

#### Turn 114 **[PLAYER]**

I grab Rosa’s good wrist and haul her up. “Then we don’t give ’em a straight line—move.”  

To Niall, I snap, “Keep Tommy pinned to that wall—no open yard. If you see a door, a truck, a ditch, you take it.”  

I press my scarf into Rosa’s bleeding forearm for a quick wrap and start hustling them along the warehouse edge into the fog, eyes sweeping for cover or another way out. “Rosa—any idea where this yard opens up? Any gate, any alley?”

*Agent reasoning: We’re exposed and unarmed; if they can’t use the window, they’ll flank. Eve’s instinct is to move the wounded fast, keep people together, and find a hidey-hole in the yard rather than try to be a hero.*

#### Turn 115 **[GAME]**

You get Rosa up by the wrist; she comes with a sharp intake of breath, eyes watering from pain and smoke. You mash the scarf into her forearm and crank it tight. The cloth darkens immediately, but the bleeding slows to an ugly seep.

Niall takes your order like it’s a lifeline. He shoves Tommy tight to the brick, one hand on the kid’s collar, steering him in a half-run, half-stagger along the warehouse edge. Tommy keeps trying to drift out into the open without meaning to—pure panic—until Niall yanks him back every time.

Fog and rain swallow the yard in pieces. Ten feet out, shapes turn to smudges: stacked pallets, a dead handtruck, a low pile of rope and tarps. Your shoes hit puddles that hide ruts.

Rosa, breathing through her teeth, answers without looking at you: “South end’s got a chain gate—usually. Opens to Cutter’s Alley by the fish sheds. But—” She glances ahead, and her voice tightens. “—they’ve been ‘on strike.’ Saints like to post a car there.”

From behind, inside the building, you hear a door slam and men shouting—Saints choosing a faster route than the window. Footsteps pound on boards, then fade, repositioning toward an exterior exit.

Then a new sound: an engine turning over somewhere ahead-left, muffled by fog. Headlights bloom as two pale cones, sweeping, searching for movement along the wall line. Whoever’s driving isn’t in a hurry yet—confident, like they expect you to run into the light.

Niall hisses, “Down,” and flattens Tommy instinctively, pressing him into the wet brick. Tommy whimpers, “I can’t—”

Rosa grabs your sleeve with her good hand and jerks you toward a recessed loading bay: a shallow indent in the warehouse wall with a metal roll-up door and a narrow personnel door beside it. The bay offers shadow and cover from the headlights—if the door’s not locked and if you can get to it before the beams sweep back.

Behind you, a Saints voice carries through the fog from the building corner you just passed: “Yard! They’re in the yard—cut ’em off!”

The threats are now split: men coming out on foot from behind, and a vehicle with headlights actively sweeping ahead toward the south gate.

```

#### Turn 116 **[PLAYER]**

I shove Rosa into the recessed loading bay shadow and whisper, “Back in—where the light can’t lick you.”  

I grab Niall’s sleeve and jerk my chin toward the personnel door. “Get Tommy on his feet and in here—quiet.”  

Then I put my ear to the door for half a breath, try the handle, and if it’s locked I start patting around the frame for a latch or a broken pane—muttering, “Come on, sweetheart… don’t you do this to me now.”

*Agent reasoning: The headlights will pin us if we bolt for the gate; the recessed bay gives us shadow and maybe a door we can slip through. I’m not leaving Tommy to freeze up, and Rosa’s bleeding—get us hidden, then decide.*

#### Turn 117 **[GAME]**

Rosa stumbles backward into the recess and presses herself against the corrugated metal of the roll-up door, pulling her bleeding arm in tight. She nods once, jaw clenched, trying to make herself small in the shadow.

Niall yanks Tommy upright by the back of his shirt and half-carries him toward the personnel door. “Quiet,” he growls in Tommy’s ear. Tommy’s breathing comes out in wet little bursts, but he clamps his mouth shut.

You put your ear to the personnel door.

On the other side: nothing—no footsteps, no voices—just the faint creak of a building settling and the distant hiss of rain. For half a breath it feels empty.

You try the handle.

It doesn’t budge. Not just locked—latched hard, like there’s a bar or a deadbolt thrown from inside. You rattle it once, carefully, and the metal gives a dull clunk that seems too loud in the bay.

You pat the frame. Your fingers find cold rivets, peeling paint, and—near the top corner—wire mesh over a narrow glass pane. The glass behind the mesh is intact. No easy reach-through. Along the hinge side you find a seam where the frame’s slightly proud, but there’s no exterior latch—just solid industrial fit.

The headlights sweep again, closer now, painting the wet ground in front of the bay. The light doesn’t hit you directly in the recess, but it catches the edge of Rosa’s hair and turns the rain into white needles. The engine idles just beyond the fog, a patient purr.

From behind, around the warehouse corner you came from, a man’s silhouette breaks into view—Saint on foot, revolver low, moving fast along the wall like he knows exactly where the recess is. He hasn’t seen you yet, but he’s close enough that if he rounds the last few yards, he’ll be looking straight into the bay’s mouth.

Niall whispers, tight and urgent, “Eve—door’s no good.”

Rosa lifts her good hand and points, not to the door—up. Inside the recess, above the personnel door, there’s a rain gutter and a metal ladder bolted to the brick that runs to a narrow catwalk line under the eaves. “Roofline,” she mouths.

The threats are immediate and specific: one Saint is about to round into the loading bay from behind with a revolver, and the car’s headlights are sweeping and idling somewhere ahead, ready to catch anyone who bolts out of cover.

#### Turn 118 **[PLAYER]**

I grab Tommy by the collar and shove him toward the ladder. “Up—hands and feet, don’t look down.”  

I jerk my head at Niall. “You first, then haul him—Rosa after. No noise.”  

I press my back to the bay wall near the corner they’ll round, holding my breath, and whisper to Rosa as she moves, “If he shows his face—put him down. One shot.”

*Agent reasoning: The door’s a dead end and we’re about to be spotted; the ladder gives us vertical cover and a way to slip along the roofline out of the headlights. We need silence and speed, and I’ll buy them a heartbeat if the Saint rounds in.*

#### Turn 119 **[GAME]**

Tommy’s eyes go wide at the ladder, but your grip on his collar steers him like a handle. He gets both hands on the cold rungs and starts climbing—clumsy, boots scraping metal.

Niall goes up after him, fast and practiced, keeping his weight close to the wall. He reaches down, grabs the back of Tommy’s belt, and gives him a steadying shove upward when the kid’s foot slips on a wet rung. Tommy lets out a small, involuntary grunt before he swallows it.

Rosa moves last, but when she brings her hand up you see the problem: she’s empty. No shotgun—left inside, now in the fire. She pats her coat once like she can conjure it back, then shakes her head at you, tight-lipped.

“I can’t,” she whispers. “No iron.”

You flatten yourself against the bay wall near the corner, breath held, ready to be the first thing the Saint runs into.

He rounds the corner at a jog.

Close enough you can smell his wet wool and cigarette breath. He’s got a revolver in his right hand, finger already inside the guard. His eyes flick into the recess—and catch the ladder movement above your head.

“Got you—” he starts, bringing the gun up.

You slam your shoulder into him before he can aim. The revolver cracks anyway—one shot—deafening in the recess. The bullet punches into the corrugated roll-up door behind Rosa with a metallic shriek, throwing a spark and making her flinch back hard.

The Saint staggers, but he doesn’t go down. He’s strong and wired with panic; his left hand claws at your coat and he tries to jam the gun down into your ribs at contact distance.

Above, Niall freezes for half a second on the ladder, then keeps climbing, hauling Tommy faster. Tommy’s boots scrape again—loud.

Out in the fog, the idling car reacts to the gunshot: the engine revs and the headlights swing sharply toward the recessed bay, the beams starting to crawl toward the mouth of your cover.

Immediate threat: you’re locked in a close-quarters struggle with an armed Saint who’s trying to get the revolver onto you, and the car’s headlights are turning in—about to light the recess and expose everyone on the ladder.

#### Turn 120 **[PLAYER]**

I clamp both hands on his gun wrist and drive it up into the corrugated door, grinding the barrel sideways so it can’t line up with my ribs. Then I smash my knee up between his legs and hiss at Rosa, “Brick—pipe—anything, hit his head!”

*Agent reasoning: I can’t out-wrestle a man with a gun, but I can foul the weapon and buy seconds for Niall and Tommy to get up. Rosa’s unarmed, so I need to keep the Saint from turning on her, and also keep us out of the headlights by staying deep in the recess.*

#### Turn 121 **[GAME]**

You get both hands on his gun wrist and ram it up into the corrugated door. The metal bites back with a hollow *BONG* that vibrates through your forearms. The barrel skates sideways, scraping paint, and the Saint snarls as his wrist bends against the angle.

Your knee comes up hard between his legs.

He folds with a strangled, animal sound—air and fight leaving him at once. His revolver-hand goes slack for a heartbeat, and his forehead bumps the door as he doubles. He’s not out, but he’s hurt and off-balance, boots sliding in the wet.

Rosa doesn’t hesitate. She snatches a short length of rusted pipe from the recess—something left behind in the loading bay—and swings two-handed like she’s chopping wood.

The pipe connects with the side of his head with a wet *thock*.

His eyes roll, and he drops straight down, knees first, then collapses onto his shoulder. The revolver clatters on the concrete and skids toward the bay mouth, stopping just short of the rain-slick line of light.

Rosa stands over him for half a second, chest heaving, pipe raised again in case he twitches. Blood runs from his temple into the puddles.

But the gunshot already did its work.

The car’s headlights sweep fully onto the recessed bay now, bleaching the mouth of it white. In the fog beyond the light, you catch the outline of a sedan nosing closer, slow and deliberate, like they’re about to park right in front of you. A door handle clicks somewhere in the glare—someone shifting inside.

Above, the ladder shudders as Niall and Tommy reach the top; you hear the faint metallic rattle of them getting onto the catwalk.

From behind—back the way you came—another Saints voice barks, nearer than before: “He fired! In the bay—move!”

Immediate threats are clear: a car is pulling up and about to disgorge someone into the lit bay mouth, and more Saints are closing in on foot from the warehouse corner. The downed Saint is out of the fight for the moment, but not guaranteed dead.

#### Turn 122 **[PLAYER]**

I snatch the fallen revolver and back into the deepest shadow of the bay, shoving it into Rosa’s good hand. “Up the ladder—now. Don’t argue.”

I raise my empty hand toward the headlights like I’m stepping out to surrender, then tuck in tight and fire one shot low at the sedan’s front tire the moment I see a door start to open. “MOVE!” I bark up at Niall and Tommy, and I start for the ladder right behind Rosa.

*Agent reasoning: We’re about to be lit up by the sedan and pinched by footmen; I need a gun in my hand, get Rosa up, and buy seconds by forcing the car to hesitate while we climb out of the kill zone.*

#### Turn 123 **[GAME]**

You snatch the revolver off the wet concrete and shove it into Rosa’s good hand. For a split second she looks like she might argue out of sheer pride—then she sees the headlights swallowing the bay mouth and she takes it. She holsters it clumsy in her grip and limps for the ladder, boots scraping as she starts up.

You lift your empty hand into the light like you’re about to step out.

The sedan creeps closer, and through the glare you catch movement: the driver-side door latch pops, the door cracking open a few inches.

You tuck in and fire low.

The shot punches into the front tire with a sharp *whap* and an immediate, ugly *hiss*. Rubber collapses fast. The sedan lurches to a stop at an angle, its nose dipping. The driver yelps—more surprise than pain—and the door swings wider as he tries to get out anyway.

“MOVE!” you bark up.

On the catwalk, Niall hauls Tommy by the elbow and they scramble along the eaves into the darkness, metal grating rattling under their feet. Tommy’s breathing is loud, panicked.

The sedan’s interior light flashes on as the driver spills out—Saint in a cap, revolver already in hand. He uses the open door as cover and fires twice into the recess.

One round snaps into the brick above your head, spraying grit. The other slams into the corrugated roll-up door with a shriek that makes your teeth ring.

From the warehouse corner behind you, boots pound closer—at least two men, maybe three. You hear one shout, “Up there! Ladder!”

Rosa is halfway up now, one-handed, dragging herself rung to rung. The revolver you gave her is clenched in her good fist, but she can’t aim while climbing.

You break for the ladder behind her. As you hit the first rungs, the sedan gunman leans out from behind his door, trying to angle a shot upward into the recess. The headlights keep the bay mouth lit, turning the ladder into a bright target.

Clear danger: you’re exposed on the ladder with Rosa above you, a gunman behind the sedan door firing into the recess, and more Saints closing from the rear shouting about the ladder.

```

#### Turn 124 **[PLAYER]**

I snarl up at Rosa, “Turn and shoot—just once—make him duck!” and I jerk my weight hard side to side on the rungs, trying to set the ladder rattling and spoil the sedan man’s aim. Then I climb fast, keeping my body tight to the wall, and hiss to Niall above, “If there’s anything to drop—crate, chain—drop it on that car door!”

*Agent reasoning: I’m a sitting duck in those headlights; I need to buy Rosa seconds and keep the ladder from becoming a shooting gallery. I don’t have a gun, so I’ll use height and noise—get Rosa to fire from above while I kick the ladder to throw off their aim and scramble up.*

#### Turn 125 **[GAME]**

Rosa pauses two rungs up, teeth bared. She twists her torso around the ladder one-handed—awkward, dangerous—and brings the revolver down toward the bay mouth.

The sedan gunman is half-crouched behind his open door, using it like a shield. As Rosa turns, he catches the movement and snaps a shot up the ladder.

The round punches into the ladder’s side rail with a hard *PING* just below Rosa’s boot. The whole ladder shivers.

Rosa fires once anyway. Her shot goes wide but close—sparks kick off the sedan’s door frame and the gunman flinches back behind cover, instinctively ducking his head and shrinking his profile.

You throw your weight side to side. The ladder rattles violently against its mounts, the rungs buzzing under your palms. It does spoil his aim—but it also makes every movement louder, a metallic clatter that carries.

From the corner behind, one of the approaching Saints answers the noise with certainty: “They’re on it—shoot the ladder!”

A second muzzle flash from below—one of the footmen—cracks, and a bullet smacks the brick beside you, showering dust into your eyes. Another hits the ladder lower down with a ringing *clang*, not cutting it but making your hands sting through the vibration.

You climb hard, body tight to the wall, arms burning.

Up on the catwalk, Niall’s silhouette jerks in the gloom. “Got chain!” he hisses back, voice strained. You hear metal scrape—links dragged over grating—then a heavy, ugly *CHUNK* as something drops.

A length of chain with a hook at the end swings down and slams into the sedan’s open door. The impact dents the door edge and yanks it outward; the gunman stumbles, his cover shifting and the door momentarily pulled off the angle he wanted. He curses—loud, furious—and fires blindly once, the shot going high into the warehouse wall.

Immediate threats: Saints on foot are now actively shooting at the ladder from behind, and the sedan gunman is still armed and recovering his cover. The chain is hanging and swaying—an obstacle and potential tool—but it’s also a clear marker of where you are in the headlights.

#### Turn 126 **[PLAYER]**

I spit the brick dust out and grab the swinging chain with one hand, heaving it hard toward the sedan’s door to tangle his arm and yank his cover again. “Niall—pull it back up! Rosa—keep climbing!”

Then I climb like hell, tight to the wall, and as I near the top I hiss, “When I’m up, we cut left—no heroics, just run.”

*Agent reasoning: The ladder’s turning into a shooting gallery; if I can buy seconds, we live. The chain’s already there—use it to foul the sedan man and block the footmen’s line, then get up and away before the ladder gets chewed apart.*

#### Turn 127 **[GAME]**

You catch the chain one-handed mid-swing. The links bite into your palm, slick with rain and grit, and the sudden weight yanks your shoulder down hard enough your boot slips a rung. For a half-beat you’re hanging by forearms and stubbornness.

You heave anyway—put your whole body into it—and the hook-end whips toward the sedan.

It doesn’t neatly tangle his gun arm. It’s uglier than that.

The hook clips the top edge of the open door and *grabs*. The chain goes taut with a teeth-jarring snap, and the door jerks outward. The Saint behind it is forced to lunge, one hand shooting out to keep his balance. His revolver arm swings wide, exposed.

Rosa, above you, doesn’t stop to look. She just climbs, faster now, boots hammering rungs.

“Niall—pull it back up!” you bark.

Niall braces on the catwalk and hauls. The chain scrapes over the grating, shrieking, and as it tightens it drags the sedan door another few inches—enough that the Saint loses his crouch and stumbles into the headlight beam, fully visible for a second. He snaps a shot upward out of reflex.

The round cracks past your ear and smacks into the brick near the catwalk, showering dust over Niall’s sleeve. He swears and yanks harder.

Behind you, the foot Saints reach the base of the ladder. One of them grabs at the lower rungs and *shoves*—not enough to topple it, but enough to set it bucking. Another fires up the rails again; the bullet punches through a rung two steps below where you just were, splintering wood/metal and leaving a sharp-edged gap.

“You want ’em alive?” a voice snarls from below.

“Not her!” another answers—meaning you, and it lands like a hook in your gut.

You climb like hell, tight to the wall. Your hands find the top edge of the catwalk; you swing a knee over and get up onto the grating beside Niall. Rosa is already limping left, revolver in her good hand now that she’s off the ladder.

Below, the sedan gunman is still fighting the chain and his door, trying to free it; the two Saints at the ladder base start climbing after you, boots ringing on the rungs.

You’re up. Left is open along the catwalk into darker roofline—runable—but you have immediate pursuit coming up the ladder and a gunman below who’s about to get his cover back.

#### Turn 128 **[PLAYER]**

I grab the chain with both hands and stomp my heel against it on the grating, pinning it. “Niall—help me HOLD!” I hiss, then I yank hard to keep it taut and whipping, trying to smash the hook-end down the ladder line into the first climber’s hands.

I snap my head at Rosa. “Go—left, don’t stop!” Then the moment the climber recoils, I let the chain go and bolt after her along the catwalk, keeping low and moving fast into the dark.

*Agent reasoning: They’re coming up the ladder and they want me specifically; I need to buy seconds, not win a shootout. The chain’s already doing work—use it to punish the climbers, then run left with the others.*

#### Turn 129 **[GAME]**

You plant your heel on the chain and haul with both hands. The links grind against the grating and your boot sole, and the tension sings through your arms.

Niall drops into it with you, shoulder and forearms braced. “Hold—hold—” he mutters, face tight.

You snap the chain downward along the ladder line. The hook-end whips like a mean pendulum and catches the first climber—Saint in a flat cap—right across the knuckles as he reaches up.

He howls and his grip breaks. His revolver clatters down the rungs, bouncing and spinning into the recess below. He flails, boots scraping, and drops two rungs hard before catching himself with his forearms, stunned and swearing.

That half-second is all you wanted.

“GO—left!” you bark at Rosa.

Rosa doesn’t argue. She limps into the darkness along the catwalk, shoulders hunched, revolver tight in her fist.

You release the chain and bolt after her, low. Niall peels off right behind you.

The moment you let go, the chain slackens. Down below, the sedan gunman finally wrenches his door free of the hook with a violent jerk. The door swings and slams half-shut, and he immediately uses it again—then angles his revolver up toward the catwalk line.

Two shots crack in quick succession. One punches sparks off the grating behind you; the other smacks into the brick parapet ahead, spraying chips into the dark.

Behind you, the second climber keeps coming, faster now. You can hear him gaining—boots ringing up the ladder, breath ragged, furious: “She’s on the roof—don’t let her get off!”

As you and Rosa push left into the darker run, the catwalk narrows past a roof vent and a sagging section of grating. The vent’s metal housing blocks sightlines for a moment—good for cover, bad for footing. Rosa stumbles once on the uneven grate but catches herself on the rail and keeps moving.

Immediate danger is now a foot pursuit: at least one Saint is about to crest the ladder onto the catwalk behind you, with the sedan gunman firing up from below whenever he gets an angle.

#### Turn 130 **[PLAYER]**

I grab Rosa’s elbow and steer her tight around the vent, hissing, “Eyes on your feet—don’t look back.” At the corner of the vent, I snatch a loose bit of scrap/grating edge and kick at the sagging section to make it give way behind us, then whisper to Niall, “If he pops up, shove him—no bullets.”

*Agent reasoning: Rosa’s hurt and we can’t win a rooftop gunfight; I’ll use the vent as a blind corner to slow the climber, then get us off this narrow catwalk fast.*

#### Turn 131 **[GAME]**

You clamp a hand on Rosa’s elbow and steer her tight around the vent housing. She’s breathing through her teeth, eyes down like you ordered, boots finding the safer line along the rail. “I’m good,” she spits, but she doesn’t look back.

At the vent corner you snatch up a loose strip of metal—more a torn grating flange than a proper bar—and stomp the sagging section with your heel.

It doesn’t collapse cleanly. The first kick makes it *boing* and dip, screaming against its fasteners. The second kick tears one end free with a harsh *RIP*—and the whole section drops a foot, hanging like a sprung trapdoor rather than falling away. It’ll catch a boot, twist an ankle, maybe dump someone if they’re running hard… but it’s still there, half-attached, rattling and obvious.

Niall nods once at your whisper, jaw set. He doesn’t draw—just plants himself on the safe side of the vent, hands open, ready to shove.

The Saint crests the ladder a heartbeat later—flat cap, knuckles red where the chain kissed him, eyes wild. He swings a leg onto the catwalk and lunges after you without thinking.

His boot hits the weakened section.

The grating drops under him and his weight pitches forward. He slams chest-first into the rail with a grunt, one arm plunging down through the gap. He’s not gone—he’s stuck, half-kneeling, scrambling for leverage.

Niall steps in and shoves hard, both palms to the Saint’s shoulder and neck. The man’s balance breaks; he slides, then drops with a yelp as the remaining fastener finally gives. Metal shrieks. The Saint falls out of sight into the darkness below—followed a beat later by the torn grating, clanging as it bounces off something down there.

Immediate consequence: you’ve bought distance—one pursuer is down and likely hurt—but the collapse is loud as a bell. Below, someone shouts, “Up top!” and the sedan gunman’s next shots start walking toward the vent line, trying to find you through sound rather than sight.

#### Turn 132 **[PLAYER]**

I duck low and shove Rosa ahead, “Keep moving—breathe, just one foot after the other.” 

I grab Niall’s sleeve and pull him with us into the darkest stretch past the vent, scanning for a stairwell door or an adjacent roofline we can jump, and I hiss, “No more noise—next shot you hear, we drop flat.”

*Agent reasoning: The noise just painted a target on us; staying near the vent gets us pinned. Rosa’s hurt, so I need cover and a quick exit route—somewhere the headlights and gunman can’t angle up. I also don’t want Niall playing hero and catching a bullet.*

#### Turn 133 **[GAME]**

You keep Rosa moving, palm between her shoulder blades, and she obeys—breathing ragged but steadying, eyes still on the grating. “One foot,” she mutters like she’s counting herself back into her body.

You hook two fingers into Niall’s sleeve and drag him with you into the darker stretch beyond the vent. The light from the yard thins here; the catwalk runs alongside a higher brick wall, and the shadow under the parapet gives you a strip of cover—thin, but real.

Ahead, you spot two options as you move:

- **A metal stairwell bulkhead door** set into the roofline, about twenty feet ahead on your left. It’s the squat kind with a slanted top. There’s a **padlock** on the hasp, but the door is slightly misaligned like it’s been forced before.
- **An adjacent roofline** across a gap to your right—another warehouse roof, lower by maybe three feet. The gap looks **six to eight feet** wide. Doable for someone uninjured. Rosa’s limp makes it a question.

You hiss your rule about noise and dropping flat.

A shot answers you almost immediately—*CRACK*—and you all hit the deck on instinct.

The bullet doesn’t hit you. It **pings off the parapet lip** above your heads and whines away into the night. The sedan gunman is firing blind, using the earlier collapse and your footfalls to guess.

From below, you hear boots and shouting spreading: at least **two more Saints** are moving in the yard now, not just the sedan man. One voice calls, “Find the roof access—cut ’em off!”

Rosa, prone beside you, turns her head just enough to whisper, “Stairs. Please tell me that’s stairs.”

Niall’s breathing is loud in the quiet; he clamps a hand over his own mouth, eyes wide, listening. Another shot doesn’t come right away—meaning the gunman’s either repositioning or reloading, but the men on foot are clearly trying to reach a **different way up**.

#### Turn 134 **[PLAYER]**

I squeeze Rosa’s hand once. “Stairs,” I whisper. “Keep low. On my count.”

I crawl to the bulkhead door and test the padlock and hasp with a careful tug, then jam my scrap of metal into the misaligned seam and lean my weight into it, trying to pop it without a big clang. “Niall—cover her. If you hear boots on metal, we freeze.”

*Agent reasoning: Rosa’s hurt—jumping roofs could kill her. The stairwell is risky with the lock, but it’s cover and a way down; Eve will try force over finesse and keep everyone quiet.*

#### Turn 135 **[GAME]**

You squeeze Rosa’s hand once. She squeezes back—hard, like she’s anchoring herself to the roof.

You belly-crawl to the bulkhead. Up close, the padlock is old and cheap, but the hasp is bolted into the doorframe with thick screws. You give it a careful tug: the lock holds, but the door *does* flex against the frame—the misalignment is real.

You slide the torn strip of metal into the seam near the latch side and lean in slow, putting your weight on it the way you’d ease a stuck window.

For a second it’s almost silent—just metal whispering on metal.

Then the strip bites, slips, and the edge of the door jumps a fraction of an inch with a sharp *tink*.

Not a full clang, but not nothing.

Niall stays back with Rosa, one hand out like he’s holding her in place without touching. He whispers, barely air: “I got her.”

From below and behind, you hear it: boots on metal—distant but distinct—someone has found another ladder or exterior stair and is coming up fast. A voice carries up through the structure: “Roof! Roof!”

Niall freezes instantly, eyes snapping toward the sound. Rosa goes statue-still, face pressed to the grating, trying not to sob-breathe.

You keep pressure on the improvised pry, gentler now. The door gives another hair, enough that you can see darkness through the seam—but the padlock still pins the hasp. You’re not popping the lock this way without either:
- ripping the hasp screws (loud, likely), or
- getting leverage on the lock itself (also likely loud), or
- finding another way in.

The immediate threat is now concrete: at least one Saint is ascending onto the roof from a nearer access point, and he’ll be on the roof within seconds—close enough to see the bulkhead and the three of you if he rounds the parapet line.

#### Turn 136 **[PLAYER]**

I grit my teeth and whisper, “Sorry,” then hook the scrap under the padlock and stomp down hard, trying to shear it or twist the hasp enough to slip it free. 

I glance back at Niall and Rosa. “Soon as it gives—inside, fast and quiet. If he shows, Niall, put him on his back.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re out of time for quiet finesse; I’d rather gamble on one sharp noise than get cornered on the roof. The lock looks cheap—if I can break or twist it fast, we vanish downstairs before they crest.*

#### Turn 137 **[GAME]**

You hook the jagged scrap under the padlock body, brace your boot on the door’s edge for purchase, and stomp down.

The roof answers with a brutal, ringing *CLANG* that slices through the rain like a dinner bell.

The lock doesn’t shear cleanly. Instead, the hasp twists—metal protesting—then one of the frame screws rips halfway out with a squeal. The padlock pops free of the staple on one side and hangs crooked, still attached to the hasp plate. The door jumps outward an inch.

Enough.

But the noise is a flare.

Niall’s head snaps toward the far side of the roof. He pulls Rosa tighter behind the vent line, keeping her low with his forearm. “Stay down,” he breathes at her, then shifts his weight forward, ready to intercept.

A Saint appears at the roof edge near the other access—coat collar up, face slick with rain, a short club in his hand. He sees the bulkhead door move and barks, “HEY—”

You don’t give him the rest of the word. You wrench the bulkhead door with both hands. The twisted hasp scrapes and then tears away with a screech, and the door swings open onto a steep, dark stairwell that smells of rust and wet concrete.

The Saint starts toward you, boots hammering the grating.

Niall surges out of cover and meets him halfway. He doesn’t punch—he rams shoulder-first into the man’s chest. The Saint staggers, tries to bring the club down; Niall catches the wrist, twists, and drives him back into the parapet. The club clatters once—loud—then skitters.

“Inside!” Niall snaps without looking at you, teeth bared as he keeps the Saint pinned.

Rosa crawls, then scrambles, favoring her leg, and slips past you into the stairwell. You’re at the threshold with the door in your hands, the open stairwell yawning below.

Behind Niall, from the yard, a voice shouts up: “They’re at the bulkhead!” Another set of boots hits the metal ladder—someone else is coming.

You have a narrow window: Rosa is in. Niall is engaged. The door is open, but closing it will mean leaving Niall out—or trusting him to follow under pressure.

#### Turn 138 **[PLAYER]**

I grab the fallen club by the handle as I step out of the doorway, swing it low into the Saint’s knee to buckle him, and snap at Niall, “NOW—MOVE!”

As Niall breaks for the bulkhead, I back into the stairwell after him, hauling the door inward and jamming the twisted hasp and my scrap into the gap like a wedge. “Rosa—down, down—don’t stop till you hit the next landing.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m not leaving Niall on the roof—he’s the only thing between us and the Saints. I need to buy him a heartbeat, get him through the door, then jam it shut behind us.*

#### Turn 139 **[GAME]**

The club’s handle is slick with rain, but you get a fistful and swing low.

It connects with the Saint’s knee with a dull, wet *thunk*. His leg buckles sideways and he lets out a sharp, involuntary yelp—more surprise than bravery. Niall uses the instant: he shoves the man off the parapet line and bolts for the bulkhead.

The Saint drops to one knee, one hand clawing at the metal grating, the other reaching blindly for his club—then realizing it’s gone. He snarls, “You—!”

You’re already backing into the stairwell. Niall dives in after you, shoulder clipping the doorframe. You haul the bulkhead door inward; it scrapes on its warped hinge and slams almost shut.

You jam the twisted hasp and your scrap into the gap. It doesn’t “lock,” but it wedges—hard. The door holds with a trembling, metal-on-metal grind.

“Rosa—down, down—don’t stop—” you snap.

Rosa is already half-running, half-falling down the steep steps, one hand on the rail, the other on her ribs. She doesn’t answer—just goes, feet slapping the concrete stairs. You hear her hit the next landing and keep going.

From above, the wounded Saint limps to the door and throws his weight into it.

The wedge holds—barely. The door bows inward a fraction with each hit, vibrating through the frame into your hands and forearms. He shouts, voice close and furious, “OPEN IT! OPEN IT OR I SWEAR—”

Then another sound joins him: boots arriving on the roof access outside, someone else barking, “He’s in the door—get it!”

They start working the bulkhead from the roof side—shoulders, hands, maybe a boot—trying to force it. The wedge buys you seconds, not minutes.

Niall grabs your elbow and yanks you down the stairs. “Move,” he says, breath tight. “They’ll tear that door off.”

As you descend, the stairwell opens into a dim utility corridor below—light leaking from a bare bulb somewhere ahead. The pounding above continues, but muffled now. You can still hear the metal door flexing.

At the bottom landing, Rosa is bent over, trying to breathe quietly. She looks up at you, eyes shining with fear. “Which way?” she whispers.

Behind you, from above, the wedge gives a sharp, warning *squeal*—metal slipping a hair.

#### Turn 140 **[PLAYER]**

I grip Rosa’s arm and point her toward the faint light. “That way—keep your head down and your mouth shut, sweetheart.”  

I press the club into Niall’s hands and murmur, “You’re rear—if that door goes, you slow ’em, then run like hell.”  

Then I creep toward the bulb-lit corridor, eyes sweeping for an office door, a freight elevator, or any sign of a loading bay, and I whisper, “Rosa—can you run if I have to pull you?”

*Agent reasoning: The bulkhead won’t hold; we need distance and a way out. Light ahead means people, but also exits and cover—better than being trapped at the stair. I’ll keep Rosa moving, use Niall as rear guard, and listen for doors/loading bay sounds.*

#### Turn 141 **[GAME]**

Rosa flinches when you take her arm, but she lets you steer her. She nods fast at your instruction, swallowing whatever sound wants to come out.

You shove the Saint’s club into Niall’s hands. He grips it like he’s held one before, knuckles whitening. “Rear,” he repeats, more to himself than you, and backs a step up the stairs to keep eyes on the bulkhead.

Overhead, the pounding turns into coordinated forcing—two bodies at least—then a harsh, metallic *crack* as something gives. Dust sifts down the stairwell.

You start forward toward the faint light. The corridor is concrete and narrow, with sweating pipes along the ceiling and a single bare bulb in a wire cage throwing a sick yellow pool ahead. Your shoes scuff grit and something that smells like old brine and machine oil.

In that light you catch shapes:

- On the right: a small office door, painted gray, with a frosted glass panel. Black stenciled letters read **FOREMAN**. The door is shut.
- Straight ahead: a wider opening into a utility run where the bulb hangs; beyond it, you can hear a slow **drip…drip** and the faint hum of electrical gear.
- On the left: a heavy steel door with a wheel-handle like a ship hatch—chalked with the same surveyor marks you saw upstairs, and that marrow-white key symbol faintly sketched beside it. It’s shut.

Rosa limps after you, trying to keep her steps quiet, one hand pressed to her thigh. When you whisper, “Rosa—can you run if I have to pull you?” she shakes her head once, then forces out, “Not… fast.” She looks up at you, jaw tight. “But I can go. Don’t leave me.”

Behind you, Niall hisses, “Eve—” and you hear him shift his stance.

Up the stairwell, the wedge finally gives with a screeching slide. The bulkhead door slams inward somewhere above, and a Saint’s voice carries down the concrete throat: “DOWN HERE! NOW!”

Niall snaps, loud and sharp: “GO!” Then the first boot thuds onto the top steps.

The threat is immediate and closing: at least two Saints have breached the roof door and are starting down the stairwell toward your corridor.

#### Turn 142 **[PLAYER]**

I grab Rosa and haul her left to the wheel-handled steel hatch, planting my feet and cranking it hard. “Come on, come on—open,” I mutter, then throw a quick look over my shoulder and hiss, “Niall—hit the first one in the throat and fall back, don’t play hero!”

*Agent reasoning: The Saints are on the stairs; we need a barrier and a hiding place. The key-marked hatch feels like the “real” way out, but it might be locked—still worth a desperate try while the foreman’s office could buy seconds and maybe a phone or window.*

#### Turn 143 **[GAME]**

You haul Rosa left; she stumbles, catches herself on the wall, and you shove her shoulder against the cold steel for cover.

You get both hands on the wheel-handle and crank.

It doesn’t budge.

Not even a fraction.

The wheel is seized or locked from the other side—your arms strain, the metal bites into your palms, and the only thing that moves is a faint tremor in the pipework overhead. You try the opposite direction—same result. Solid.

Rosa’s breath comes quick and thin. “It’s—” she starts, then clamps her mouth shut like you told her.

You glance back and hiss at Niall.

He’s already doing what you asked, but the stairwell has narrowed his options. The first Saint comes down hard, club raised, face slick and furious. Niall steps into him—not to brawl, just to interrupt—jabs up with the club’s butt end toward the man’s throat.

It lands with a choking grunt. The Saint staggers, grabbing at his neck.

But the second Saint is right behind him, hand on the rail, and he uses the first man’s stumble like a shield—shoving past, forcing the choke-gasping one sideways into the wall. The second one has a short pistol out, low and ugly in the dim. He doesn’t fire yet—he’s trying not to hit his own man—but he levels it down the steps and barks, “DON’T MOVE!”

Niall freezes for a half-beat, then starts backing down, one step at a time, keeping his body between them and you, club held like he means it. He’s breathing hard. “Eve—hatch’s no good?”

The first Saint coughs and spits, then finds his feet again, eyes watering with rage. “That’s her,” he rasps. “That’s the club girl.”

The pistol Saint advances to the bottom steps. Now you’re in a tight triangle: you and Rosa pinned against the steel hatch that won’t open; Niall a few paces away in the corridor; two Saints at the stairwell mouth—one with a pistol, one with a club and a bad throat—closing the distance.

The pistol Saint’s gaze flicks to the chalked key mark on the hatch and back to you. “Funny door to die in front of,” he says, and raises the muzzle a little higher.

#### Turn 144 **[PLAYER]**

I raise my empty hands slow, stepping half in front of Rosa. “Easy, boys—no need to make a sermon outta this,” I say, voice soft as smoke, eyes on the pistol. “You want the girl? Fine. Let her go—she’s just a limping witness.”

Without looking back, I murmur through my teeth, “Niall… office door. When he blinks.”

Then I tilt my chin at the key mark on the hatch like it’s a joke between us. “You really think I know what that little drawing means? I sing for drunks—I don’t draw maps.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re cornered and that gun will end this fast if I lunge. Eve survives by talking and reading men; buy seconds, shift their attention, and look for a softer exit—office door—while keeping Rosa behind me and giving Niall a cue.*

#### Turn 145 **[GAME]**

Your hands come up slow. You step half in front of Rosa, blocking her with your body.

The pistol Saint doesn’t lower the gun. He lowers his voice instead, like that makes it merciful. “Look at that,” he says to his partner, “she’s got manners.”

The throat-hit Saint swallows hard, winces, and spits again. “Manners don’t mean she ain’t got our paper.” He takes two limping steps into the corridor, club dragging in his fist.

You pitch it soft, offer Rosa like a compromise.

The pistol Saint’s eyes flick to Rosa—then back to you. “We ain’t here for the witness,” he says. “We’re here for what you lifted.” He keeps the muzzle trained center-mass, steady hands. “But—” He jerks his chin. “The limper can go sit in the corner. Quiet. If she runs, she bleeds.”

Rosa starts to edge away from you, terrified but obeying the opening. She limps toward the wall by the foreman’s office door, pressing her back to the concrete, hands up near her chest.

Your murmur to Niall lands. Niall’s eyes cut to the **FOREMAN** door. He shifts his weight like he’s just trying to breathe.

The throat-hit Saint notices the movement and snaps his head toward Niall. “Hey—”

That single distraction is the blink you were waiting for, but it isn’t clean: the pistol Saint doesn’t blink. He tracks Niall with the gun without moving his feet, and the muzzle follows like it’s on a string.

“Don’t,” the pistol Saint says—flat, certain. “You touch that door, I put one in him.”

Niall stops mid-step, jaw tight, club still up. He doesn’t retreat—doesn’t advance. He’s stuck.

The throat-hit Saint closes the remaining distance toward you, eyes wet and furious. He reaches out with his free hand—not to strike, to grab—fingers going for your wrist like you’re a package with a tag.

“Turn your pockets out,” he rasps. “Slow.”

The threat is immediate and explicit: one Saint is within arm’s reach and about to physically search you; the other has a pistol trained on Niall and can shoot if anyone makes for the office door.

#### Turn 146 **[PLAYER]**

I let my shoulders sag like I’m beaten and hold my hands out, palms open. “Alright… alright. Slow,” I murmur, eyes on his face—then I catch his grabbing wrist with both hands and wrench it down and in, slamming my knee up into his groin and yanking him tight against me.  

I press my forearm up under his throat and snarl over his shoulder at the pistol man, “Shoot and you’re baptizin’ your own.”  

“Niall—NOW, office!” I bark, dragging the choking Saint sideways toward the foreman’s door as cover.

*Agent reasoning: I can’t let him search me—whatever I’m carrying will damn us. I’ll play compliant to get his hands where I want them, then turn it ugly fast and use him as a shield from the gun.*

#### Turn 147 **[GAME]**

You sell the surrender well—shoulders dropping, palms open—close enough that the throat-hit Saint commits his weight into the grab.

You trap his wrist with both hands and wrench it down and inward. His elbow buckles; his club-hand jerks uselessly. Your knee drives up hard into his groin.

He makes a wet, strangled sound and folds—then you yank him upright into you before he can collapse, using his pain like a handle. Your forearm snakes up under his throat and you cinch him tight, his heels skidding on the gritty concrete as you drag him sideways.

The pistol Saint reacts instantly: he snaps the gun up, sighting past his partner’s shoulder—then checks himself. The muzzle wavers, hunting for an angle that won’t punch through his own man. “You—” he spits, furious, but he doesn’t fire.

The hostage Saint claws at your forearm, face blotching red, eyes watering. He can’t get air clean; the earlier throat shot makes it worse. His club slips from his fingers and clatters to the floor, ringing in the corridor.

You snarl your warning. It lands—because the pistol Saint’s next move is to shift left, trying to widen his line of fire.

“Niall—NOW, office!” you bark.

Niall moves. Fast. He lunges for the **FOREMAN** door, shoulder-first.

The door doesn’t swing open—it's locked—but the frame is old. His first hit cracks the frosted glass panel with a sharp spiderweb. His second slam caves the glass inward with a crash, and he rams an arm through, fumbling for the inside latch.

The pistol Saint sees the play and commits: he steps laterally, trying to get a clean shot on Niall through the broken glass. He barks, “STOP—” and squeezes off a round.

The shot is deafening in the concrete throat. The bullet punches into the office doorframe near Niall’s shoulder, spitting a chip of wood and plaster into his face. Niall flinches but stays on the latch, teeth bared.

Your hostage bucks, panicking, and his boots scrape for purchase. He manages a hoarse, broken shout around your forearm: “H—HE’S GOT THE—”

The pistol Saint’s eyes flick to you—calculating—then back to Niall, gun still up, ready to fire again the moment he has a line.

Immediate threats:
- The pistol Saint has fired once and is repositioning for another shot at Niall.
- Your hostage is choking and thrashing; if he slips free, you’re exposed in the open corridor.
- The office door is partially breached; Niall is seconds from either popping the latch or getting shot.

#### Turn 148 **[PLAYER]**

I wrench the Saint tighter and drag him hard into the pistol man’s line, his head and shoulders blocking the shot, and I rasp in his ear, “Scream louder, sweetheart—help your friend aim.”  

Then I shout at the gunman, “Drop it and you get him breathin’ again—try for Niall and I’ll crush his windpipe right here!”  

Without waiting to see if he believes me, I heave the choking Saint sideways into the pistol man like a battering ram and lunge after the impact toward the foreman’s door, snapping, “Niall—get it OPEN, now—Rosa, move!”

*Agent reasoning: I can’t outshoot a pistol, so I’ll keep my body shield between him and Niall and force the gunman to hesitate; I’ll use the hostage’s panic to make noise and buy Niall seconds to get that door open, even if it means getting my hands dirty.*

#### Turn 149 **[GAME]**

You haul the choking Saint sideways, forcing his bulk into the pistol man’s sightline. The gunman’s stance shifts again—he has to—because his own partner’s head is now the closest target.

Your rasp in the Saint’s ear makes him panic harder. He doesn’t scream so much as wheeze and gag, clawing at your forearm, eyes bulging.

“Drop it—” you shout, and then you don’t wait.

You heave.

The Saint’s body slams into the pistol man with a meaty impact. The gunman staggers back a half-step, shoulder clipping the stairwell rail; his pistol arm jerks up. Reflex takes over—his finger tightens.

A second shot cracks off.

It goes wild—straight into the ceiling pipe run—sparks spit and a thin jet of water hisses down like a sudden cold rain. The corridor fills with the sharp stink of wet rust and gunpowder.

The collision buys you a heartbeat. You lunge for the foreman’s office door.

Niall is still working the busted panel, arm inside up to the elbow. “I—got—” he grunts, and then the latch finally gives.

The office door swings inward.

“IN!” Niall barks, grabbing your sleeve and yanking you across the threshold.

Behind you, Rosa scrambles—limping fast, nearly falling—then stumbles into the doorway after you, hands up over her head like that’ll stop bullets.

The pistol Saint recovers quicker than you’d like. He shoves his partner off him with a snarl—“GET OFF”—and drives forward, gun coming level again. He doesn’t fire into the office immediately; he snaps his gaze to the doorframe, measuring the angle.

The choking Saint drops to one knee in the corridor, one hand on his throat, sucking air in ragged, high pulls. He’s not out—just hurt and furious.

Inside the foreman’s office: stale cigar smoke, a metal desk, a wall safe half-hidden behind a peeling pin-up calendar, and a rear interior door (solid, unglazed) that likely leads deeper into the warehouse.

Niall shoves the office door toward closed—but it won’t latch clean with the glass shattered and the frame twisted. It hangs mostly shut, leaving a jagged, fist-wide gap at the edge.

Threat, clear and immediate: the pistol Saint is stepping up to that gap with his gun ready; he can shoot through the opening the moment he sees movement. The other Saint is regaining his breath and will be back on his feet in seconds.

#### Turn 150 **[PLAYER]**

I grab the metal desk with both hands and heave it sideways into the office door, ramming it to jam the gap. “Niall—back door, now. Rosa—stay low and stick to me.”

As I shove, I snap a look at the wall safe and hiss, “If it’s already open, we take it—if it ain’t, we don’t die for it,” then I pull Rosa toward the rear interior door and reach for the handle.

*Agent reasoning: That gap is a gun barrel waiting to happen; I need a dirty, fast block and get us out the back before they regroup. If there’s a desk, it’s a shield—if there’s a rear door, it’s our way out.*

#### Turn 151 **[GAME]**

You get both hands under the desk edge and heave. It’s heavier than it looks—solid steel frame, drawers full of paperweight junk—but it slides with a screech that sets your teeth on edge.

You ram it into the office door. The desk corner bites into the warped frame and the door shudders inward, the jagged gap shrinking to a narrow seam. The desk doesn’t “lock” it shut, but it **blocks the line of sight** and forces anyone outside to either shove the desk back or fire blind through wood and metal.

Outside, the pistol Saint steps up and immediately tries to muscle the door. It gives an inch—then stops dead against the desk. He curses, breath sharp. “MOVE THIS—” he barks to his partner in the corridor.

A shot cracks—**not through the seam**, but into the door panel itself, testing. The round thuds into the wood with a splintering smack and ricochets inside the desk cavity with a metallic whine. No one’s hit, but you feel how thin the margin is.

Niall doesn’t argue. He peels off toward the rear interior door, grabbing the knob with both hands.

Rosa stays low like you told her, but her panic makes her clumsy—she bumps your hip as you pull her along, whispering “I can’t— I can’t—” through her teeth.

Your glance at the wall safe catches it clearly: **it’s closed**. Dial intact. No handle hanging loose. Not already open.

You reach the rear door and clamp your fingers around the handle.

It turns—stiff, like it hasn’t been used in months—and the door opens inward onto a narrow utility passage that smells of oil and wet concrete. A bare bulb hangs further down, dim and buzzing.

Behind you, the Saints start their next move: the pistol Saint stops wasting shots and puts his shoulder into the office door. The desk shudders and scrapes a half-inch across the floor.

He’s not in yet—but he’s **coming through**, and now you can hear the second Saint rejoining him, both of them grunting as they lean their weight into it.

```json
{"locations_add":["Warehouse interior — foreman’s office (inside)","Warehouse interior — rear utility passage (from foreman’s office)"]}
```

#### Turn 152 **[PLAYER]**

I grab Rosa by the forearm and haul her through the rear door, keeping her low. “You can—because you have to,” I hiss, then glance back at Niall. “Last one through kicks that door and runs—don’t play tough.”

*Agent reasoning: The desk won’t hold long and the safe’s a dead dream; I need to get Rosa moving and keep Niall close, and I’d rather flee into the utility passage than get pinned in the office.*

#### Turn 153 **[GAME]**

You clamp Rosa’s forearm and haul her through the rear door. She stumbles on the threshold, nearly goes down, and you catch her by the elbow and force her low, pushing her into the utility passage.

She’s shaking hard, breath coming in little bites. “I can’t—” she starts again.

“You can—because you have to,” you hiss, and she swallows it, eyes wide, moving because your grip won’t let her stop.

You glance back. Niall is half-turned between you and the office, jaw tight, listening to the Saints on the other side of the jammed door. The desk scrapes again—another half-inch—metal screaming against concrete.

Your warning lands. Niall gives you a sharp nod, no bravado in it. “Go. Go.”

He backs through the rear doorway after you, one hand on the doorframe for balance, the other already lifting to swing the rear door.

Behind him, the foreman’s office door buckles with a sudden slam—both Saints hitting it together. The desk jumps, skidding, and the seam at the hinge side opens just enough for a sliver of corridor light to cut in.

A voice barks from the other side, close now, furious: “THE BACK—DON’T LET ’EM—”

Niall doesn’t wait. He kicks the rear door shut with the heel of his boot and throws his weight into it. There’s no lock you can hear catch—just wood on wood and a heavy thud as he braces it with his shoulder.

Then—metallic clatter: the pistol Saint has stopped shoving and is moving, likely to circle or find another way through.

The utility passage ahead runs narrow and straight for about twenty feet before turning left. At that corner, the buzzing bulb throws a weak cone of light over pipes and a low, square opening in the wall—like a crawl access or service hatch—half covered by a loose board.

Immediate threat: the Saints are about to abandon forcing the jammed office door and **reposition**; if they know the building, they can cut you off from another corridor or come through this rear route fast.

#### Turn 154 **[PLAYER]**

I tug Rosa toward the corner light and point her at the low square opening. “In there—on your belly. Don’t argue.”  

I look back at Niall, breath tight. “Give that door ten seconds, then get your pretty head in the hole with us—if they come through, you shoot, not shout.”  

Then I yank the loose board off the hatch and drop to my knees, pushing Rosa through first and sliding in after her, listening for footsteps on the other side.

*Agent reasoning: That loose service hatch is our fastest disappearing act, and I don’t trust the rear door to hold once they circle. Rosa’s panicking, so I need to keep her moving and give Niall a clear job—cover, then follow.*

#### Turn 155 **[GAME]**

You drag Rosa to the corner under the buzzing bulb and point her at the low square opening. Up close it’s a rough service hatch cut into brick—about shoulder-width, maybe two feet off the floor—meant for pipe access. The loose board is only resting there, not nailed.

Rosa starts to protest on instinct, then sees your face and clamps her mouth shut. She drops to her belly and wriggles in, dress snagging on a splinter. She hisses in pain but keeps moving, elbows scraping concrete.

You yank the board away and drop to your knees. The hatch breathes cold air—damp, river-stink, and old lime. You shove Rosa’s heel to get her deeper, then slide in after her, shoulders tight in the narrow opening.

Inside is a cramped crawlspace running parallel to the passage, just high enough to army-crawl. Pipes sweat above you. The floor is gritty and wet; your palms come up black.

Behind you, Niall’s voice is close, controlled. “Ten.” He braces the rear door one last time—then you hear him peel off, boots quick on concrete.

A hard, immediate sound answers: **the rear door gets hit from the other side**—not a shoulder, a kick. The wood booms. Niall isn’t there to take it anymore.

Second impact—heavier. The doorframe cracks with a sharp snap like a rib.

You’re half in the hatch when the pistol Saint’s voice barks from the utility passage: “RIGHT HERE—!”

A third slam and the rear door gives way enough to swing inward several inches, scraping. Light spills into the passage in a bright wedge.

Niall appears at the hatch, dropping fast. He’s got his pistol out, but he doesn’t raise it to shoot—he tucks it close so he can fit. “Move,” he whispers, and shoves himself in behind you, boots kicking the loose board aside.

As he disappears into the crawlspace, a gunshot cracks in the passage—**not aimed, more warning than precision**—and chips brick near the hatch mouth. Dust puffs into your face.

Threat is now immediate and concrete: the Saints have breached the rear door and are in the utility passage; they’ve seen the hatch and are close enough to fire into it.

#### Turn 156 **[PLAYER]**

“Crawl—now, Rosa. Don’t stop for anything,” I hiss, shoving her ankle forward, then I twist back and kick the loose board up into the hatch mouth as best I can to spoil their aim.  

Over my shoulder at Niall, breath burning, “If you got a shot, take it—otherwise move your ass,” and I start army-crawling hard into the dark, keeping my head down and listening for them forcing their way in behind us.

*Agent reasoning: They’ve got the hatch sighted—if we linger, we get pinned and shot. I need to get Rosa moving and put distance fast, but I also want to buy us a breath by denying them a clean angle.*

#### Turn 157 **[GAME]**

Rosa lurches forward when you shove her ankle. She makes a small, strangled sound and then commits—elbows pumping, knees sliding, dress dragging grit. She doesn’t stop again.

You twist in the tight space and kick the loose board up into the hatch mouth. It catches crooked, wedged between brick and pipe, leaving a jagged gap. It’s not a seal, but it **breaks the clean line** into the crawlspace.

A shot cracks immediately after—wood splinters, the board jerks, and a shard skitters down the crawlspace and taps your cheek. The bullet doesn’t come through clean; it thumps into something solid above you with a dull, ringing complaint.

Niall doesn’t take a hero shot. He glances back once, sees the angle, and decides fast. “No line,” he mutters. Then he shoves in behind you, crawling hard, pistol tucked along his forearm so it doesn’t snag.

Behind, boots scrape and pivot in the utility passage. A Saint’s voice, close and furious: “They’re in the goddamn wall—get a light!”

Another voice answers, more cautious: “Don’t crawl in blind—”

Then metal clanks—someone yanks at piping or a bracket near the hatch. The board you wedged shudders as they grab it from outside and start worrying it loose.

You drive forward, head down, forearms burning. The crawlspace goes about ten feet and then narrows slightly where a pipe drops lower; you have to flatten your cheek to the wet grit to slide under it. Rosa makes it through, but she snags—fabric catches—and you hear her gasp as she tears free with a rip.

Behind you, the board finally gets pulled aside with a loud scrape. Light spills in again, thinner now, and you hear the Saints right at the opening.

Concrete threat: they’re about to either **fire into the crawlspace** now that the board is off, or **send someone in** with a light. You can hear a match strike—then a hiss as it dies in the damp—followed by a curse.

#### Turn 158 **[PLAYER]**

“Rosa—keep crawling, don’t you dare freeze,” I whisper-shout, then twist my shoulders just enough to hiss back at Niall, “One shot at the light-hand if he sticks it in—then MOVE.”

I scrape my fingers along the grit till I find a loose chunk of brick or pipe-scale, then whip it back toward the hatch mouth to clatter and draw their flinch, and I shove forward after Rosa, keeping my head low and my body tight to the floor.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to start firing or crawl in; I need to buy seconds and keep Rosa moving without getting Niall killed trying to be brave.*

#### Turn 159 **[GAME]**

Rosa’s crawl stutters for half a second when she hears you—then she forces herself onward, shoulders shaking, breathing loud in the tight space. The rip in her dress keeps catching on grit, but she doesn’t stop to fix it.

You twist enough to murmur to Niall. He gives a terse “Yeah,” and shifts his pistol to a two-finger grip so he can aim one-handed without lifting his whole body.

Your fingers find a jagged bit of pipe-scale—flaky rust and mineral crust. You whip it back.

It clatters off brick at the hatch mouth and skitters out into the utility passage with a sharp, unmistakable *tick-tick*.

Outside, one of the Saints flinches hard enough you hear his boot scrape. “Jesus—” he snaps, then immediately, angry at himself: “Don’t spook—get your light in there!”

A hand appears at the opening with a small pocket torch—electric, not a match this time. The beam stabs into the crawlspace, sweeping low.

Niall fires once.

The shot in the confined space is a hammer-blow. The torch explodes into glass and sparks; the hand jerks back with a choked shout. “Ahh—my—!”

But the muzzle flash gives you away for an instant, and the Saints answer on instinct: two quick shots slam into the brick lip and the pipe above you. One round punches through the pipe’s outer skin with a metallic *ping* and a wet hiss starts—steam or pressurized water venting into the crawlspace, hot and stinging as it sprays in a thin, angry line.

“IN THERE!” the pistol Saint barks. “PUT LEAD DOWN THE HOLE!”

They don’t crawl in yet, but they start firing **blindly** into the crawlspace entrance, trying to rake the first few feet.

You and Rosa are already past the low pipe pinch-point; Niall is just clearing it when the hot spray catches his sleeve. He grunts, jerks his arm in, and crawls faster, teeth clenched.

Immediate threat is now twofold: sporadic gunfire is chewing up the first stretch behind you, and the ruptured pipe is filling the crawlspace with scalding mist that will make breathing and visibility worse the longer you stay inside.

#### Turn 160 **[PLAYER]**

I cough into my sleeve and shove forward, voice raw. “Rosa—eyes on me, keep going, don’t breathe deep.”  

I reach back and grab Niall’s wrist for a second, tugging him close. “You’re bleeding or burned, you tell me now—then save the last rounds for when they crawl in.”  

Then I feel ahead in the dark for any grate, seam, or ladder up—anything that’ll get us out of this wall—and if I find one, I hiss, “Exit—here,” and start working it with my fingers like my life depends on it.

*Agent reasoning: The crawlspace is turning into a boiling, bullet-raked trap; I need to get Rosa moving and find an exit fast, even if it means taking a riskier route.*

#### Turn 161 **[GAME]**

Rosa cranes her head back just enough to catch your shape in the dark. Her eyes are wide, wet with the sting. She nods once—hard—and keeps crawling, taking shorter breaths like you told her, chest tight.

The mist behind you thickens as the ruptured pipe keeps hissing. It’s not a full flood, but it’s a hot, needling spray that turns the air into a scalding fog near the entrance. The Saints’ shots keep snapping and chipping at the brick lip—farther back now, mostly noise and ricochets, but close enough that you hear fragments patter down the crawlspace.

You catch Niall’s wrist and tug him in tight. He answers between clenched teeth, voice low. “Burn. Not blood.” He flexes his hand once like he’s checking he can still use it. “Two rounds left.”

Outside, a Saint barks, “He shot my hand—!” and another voice, colder: “Then don’t reach in again. Get the pry bar. We’ll open the wall.”

Metal scrapes—someone drags something heavy, then a *clang* against brick. They’re not crawling in yet; they’re preparing to **widen the hatch** so they can pour fire and bodies into it.

You push forward, feeling ahead with your fingertips. The crawlspace runs another few yards, then your hand finds a change: a vertical seam in the brickwork with a corroded iron frame—an old maintenance grate set into the wall, flush and painted over a dozen times. It’s held by two slotted screws and a latch that’s been half-fused by rust.

You hiss, “Exit—here,” and start working it.

Your nails scrape paint off. The latch doesn’t give at first. You jam two fingers into the crack and wrench—skin tears, and you feel warm blood smear on iron. On the second heave, the rusted latch *pops* with a small, ugly sound.

The grate swings outward an inch… then catches on something beyond it.

Through the gap you see why: there’s a chain looped across the other side, padlocked—someone secured this access from the outside. Past the chain is a dim basement room with stacked crates and a single bare bulb swaying slightly, like it heard the gunshots through the walls.

Immediate threat: you’ve found an exit, but it’s **locked from the far side**; behind you the Saints are bringing tools to break the hatch wider, and the hot mist is getting worse the longer you stay in the crawlspace.

#### Turn 162 **[PLAYER]**

I press my mouth close to Rosa’s ear. “Keep low. Keep quiet. I’m getting this open—don’t look back.”

I grab the chain through the crack and yank hard, testing the padlock, then wedge my fingers under the grate and try to lever it wider against the frame to pop the chain’s anchor. Over my shoulder to Niall, voice tight: “If I can’t break it—shoot the padlock, close as you can. One clean round.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re boxed in and the Saints are about to pry the other end open; I’m not waiting to be smoked out. I’ll try brute force first—quietly—then use Niall’s last rounds only if we must, and I’ll keep Rosa moving so she doesn’t panic.*

#### Turn 163 **[GAME]**

Rosa shrinks even lower, cheek to grit, arms wrapped tight under her like she can make herself smaller than sound. She doesn’t look back.

You hook the chain with two fingers through the narrow gap and yank. It bites into your knuckles and comes up dead-hard: the padlock holds, and so does the anchor point—bolted into the far-side wall. Whoever chained this did it to keep people *in* or *out* on purpose, not as an afterthought.

You wedge your fingers under the grate and lever it wider. The iron frame groans, flakes of rust raining down. The gap widens another inch—enough to see the chain’s path clearly—but the anchor doesn’t pop. Instead, the grate’s hinge starts to complain: a high, metallic squeal that carries.

Out in the utility passage behind you, the Saints hear it. The tool noise stops for a beat.

“There!” one of them snaps. “They’re close—keep opening it!”

A pry bar bites into the hatch behind you with a brutal *crack* of wood. Light spills farther into the crawlspace, and with it comes a fresh burst of gunfire—three shots, fast. One round punches into the crawlspace wall a few feet behind Niall, spitting brick chips that sting your calf.

Niall crawls up tight behind you, jaw set, trying not to breathe the hot mist drifting forward. “I can do it,” he says, but his burned sleeve is stuck slightly to his forearm where the spray hit; he peels it free with a hiss.

You can’t lever the anchor loose with your hands; the chain is too well set. The only clean options are force (shooting the padlock) or finding a way to reach the lock from the other side.

Niall angles his pistol toward the gap, trying to line up the padlock through the crack without putting his face in the opening. It’s a bad angle—iron grate, chain links, and a swaying bulb beyond.

Danger is immediate and concrete: the Saints are widening the rear hatch and raking the entrance; if Niall fires and misses, the ricochet in this tight space could hit you or Rosa, and the shot will also draw the Saints into a full, committed push into the crawlspace now that they know you’ve found an exit point.

#### Turn 164 **[PLAYER]**

I bare my teeth and grab the chain, yanking it through the crack to pull the padlock as tight and centered as I can. “Rosa—face down, hands over your head,” I snap, then I press my shoulder over her like a shield.  

“Niall,” I hiss, low and sharp, “wait for it to stop swinging—then put it through the lock. Don’t miss.”

*Agent reasoning: Niall’s got only two rounds and a bad angle; I don’t trust a ricochet in this tight space. Better to get the lock closer and steadier—even if it hurts—then have him take the shot while I shield Rosa and keep him from rushing.*

#### Turn 165 **[GAME]**

You yank the chain until your knuckles go white, hauling the padlock tight into the narrowest part of the gap. The links bite and chatter against the grate, then settle—taut, centered, as still as you can make it.

“Rosa—face down, hands over your head.”

Rosa obeys instantly. She folds into the dirt, forearms over her skull. You drop your shoulder over her, the closest thing to cover you can give in a tunnel this tight.

Niall inches the pistol forward, careful not to scrape the barrel on iron. He waits—one breath, two—watching the padlock through the crack. The bare bulb in the room beyond sways once more, then slows.

Behind you, the Saints’ pry bar tears at the hatch again: *CRACK—CRACK.* A voice barks, “Wider! WIDER!” and the hot mist keeps creeping forward, burning your throat with every shallow inhale.

Niall fires.

In the crawlspace, the shot is a concussion. The bullet hits true—metal shrieks, then *snaps*. The padlock jumps, split at the shackle, and the chain slumps loose with a heavy, satisfying clatter onto the basement floor beyond.

But the report is a beacon. Outside, one Saint shouts, sharp with triumph: “They’re right there—MOVE!”

Boots hammer the boards. The hatch behind you is wrenched wider in a final, violent heave, and a wedge of light and gun smoke pours into the crawlspace mouth. You hear a body drop to knees at the opening—someone getting ready to crawl in, pistol-first.

At the grate, with the chain now slack, you can shove it wider. It swings open another foot, enough for a person to squeeze through.

Rosa makes a small, broken sound—half sob, half cough—still face-down. Niall’s breathing is ragged; his burned arm trembles, but he keeps the pistol up, eyes fixed back toward the incoming light.

Immediate threat: the Saints are about to enter the crawlspace from behind and fire down the tunnel at close range. You have an open (but tight) exit into the basement room now, and only a moment before they’re on you.

#### Turn 166 **[PLAYER]**

I shove the grate wider and grab Rosa by the back of her dress and elbow. “Up—through, now. Don’t think.”  

To Niall, eyes on the widening light behind us: “Last round if you have to—then get your ass through.” I push Rosa into the basement first and scramble after her, kicking the grate toward closing as soon as my hips clear.

*Agent reasoning: We’ve bought a second—standing our ground in a tunnel gets us killed. Rosa’s shaken, Niall’s low on rounds; I need to get them through the grate fast and use the door as a choke point while we find cover.*

#### Turn 167 **[GAME]**

You wrench the grate wide enough to force a body through and haul Rosa by dress-back and elbow. She scrambles like a frightened cat, knees and palms slapping iron, then spills into the basement room on the other side—hard on her shoulder against a crate stack. She bites down a cry, coughing instead.

You follow, hips catching for a half-second on the iron frame. From behind, the crawlspace flashes with a muzzle flare—someone at the hatch fires blind down the tunnel. The round *whangs* off the grate’s edge as you clear it, a hot sting of metal flecking your thigh through the stocking, not deep but sharp.

You kick back at the grate as you land in the basement. It swings toward closed—but not all the way. The hinge is bent from age and your levering; it catches, leaving a hand-width gap.

Niall is still on the crawlspace side for a heartbeat, face ghost-pale in the bulb-light. He fires one shot back into the tunnel—more to make them flinch than to hit—and then lunges through the opening. His burned sleeve snags on the jagged hinge; cloth tears with a wet rip, and he hisses, yanking himself free. He tumbles into the basement on his side, pistol skittering a foot across the concrete.

On the other side of the half-closed grate, you hear boots and a voice close now, right at the opening: “They went through—get that grate—!”

Something slams into the iron from the crawlspace side. The grate shudders in its frame, gap widening slightly as fingers probe for purchase.

In the basement room: stacked crates stenciled with shipping marks, a single bare bulb on a cord, and—ten feet to your left—a steel personnel door with a fresh chalk survey mark near its jamb: a marrow-white key. The door’s handle is down, but you don’t know if it’s locked.

Immediate threat is clear and physical: a Saint is starting to force the grate from the crawlspace side; if they get it open, they’ll be in this room with guns in seconds.

*Simulation triggers: secret_Ed As I Can_0_e42de4*

#### Turn 168 **[PLAYER]**

I lunge for the nearest crate and heave it sideways into the grate, jamming it hard against the frame, then grab Rosa under the arm. “On your feet—door, now.”  

I snatch up Niall’s pistol off the floor and shove it into his chest as I herd him toward the steel door. “Open it—now. If it’s locked, you break it or you pick it, I don’t care which—just move.”

*Agent reasoning: The grate won’t hold and we’re out of bullets; the only chance is to buy seconds by blocking it and get everyone through that steel door fast.*

#### Turn 169 **[GAME]**

You slam your shoulder into the nearest crate stack and wrestle one loose. It’s heavier than it looks—wet wood, nails, and whatever’s inside shifting like ballast. You heave it sideways into the grate.

The crate hits iron with a teeth-rattling *BANG* and wedges hard against the frame. On the other side, the probing fingers vanish. A fist pounds once, then twice—muffled now, angry and frustrated.

“Goddamn—” a man growls through the gap. “Get a bar—!”

The grate shudders as they try again, but the crate holds for the moment. Not forever. You can hear them repositioning, scraping metal on stone in the crawlspace like someone passing a tool forward.

You yank Rosa up under the arm. She’s shaking so badly her knees want to fold, but she gets her feet under her when you drag her forward. “Door,” you snap, and she lurches with you, eyes wide and unfocused.

Niall’s pistol is on the floor where he dropped it. You snatch it up and shove it into his chest. He catches it with his good hand, breath hitching, then nods once—no talk, just motion.

You herd both of them to the steel personnel door with the chalk-marked white key. Up close you see fresh scuffs around the latch—recent use—and a faint line of light at the threshold.

Niall grabs the handle and throws his weight into it.

It doesn’t budge.

“Locked,” he spits, voice tight. He tries again, harder, shoulder into steel. The door answers with a dull *THUNK* and a vibration up his arm, but the latch holds.

Behind you, in the crawlspace wall, the crate shifts a fraction as something pries at the grate. Wood groans. The Saints aren’t in yet—but they’re actively working on it, and you can hear their breathing through the crack.

Rosa clutches your sleeve, whispering, “Eve—please—” like she can’t find the rest of the sentence.

Niall steps back from the door, jaw clenched, eyes flicking around the room for anything—tool, hinge, latch plate—anything he can use before that crate gives.

#### Turn 170 **[PLAYER]**

I grab Rosa by the shoulders and squeeze once, hard. “Rosa—look at me. Breathe shallow. If they come through that grate, you run at that door and keep low, understand?”

I spin to the crates, rip at the nearest lid with my fingers until I get purchase, then snatch out anything long and solid—crowbar, iron rod, even a bottle—and shove it into Niall’s hand. “Hinges or latch—pick one and ruin it.”

Then I raise the pistol toward the jammed grate, planting my feet. “I’ll cover. Niall, talk to me—what’s the plan, and how many seconds?”

*Agent reasoning: The grate won’t hold long and the door’s locked; we need a tool fast—something from the crates—to either smash the latch or pry hinges, and keep Rosa from freezing up.*

#### Turn 171 **[GAME]**

Rosa’s eyes snap to yours when you squeeze. She nods too fast, swallowing air like it hurts. “Low,” she whispers, and plants herself near the steel door, hunched, ready to bolt on your word.

You rip at a crate lid. The nails fight you—splinters bite under your fingernails—then the board pops loose with a sharp crack. Inside: straw packing and three long-neck bottles wrapped in paper, plus a length of rust-freckled iron pipe used as a spacer.

You grab the pipe—about two feet, heavy—and shove it into Niall’s good hand.

He doesn’t waste time choosing. He crouches at the latch side and jams the pipe between the door and the frame, trying to lever the latch plate. “Plan is ugly,” he says through his teeth. “We peel the strike plate or we shear the screws. If the frame’s rotten, it gives. If it’s not—”

A hard *SCREEE* cuts him off: metal on metal from the crawlspace. They’ve got a pry bar on the grate now.

The crate you jammed against it jerks an inch. Wood groans like it’s about to split. A voice barks, close and clear through the gap: “On three—HEAVE!”

Niall throws his weight on the pipe. The steel door flexes slightly; the latch side squeals. Nothing opens, but one screw on the strike plate lifts a hair, proud of the wood.

“Ten seconds if they’re strong,” Niall says, breath ragged. “Maybe less.”

You bring the pistol up on the grate gap.

On “three,” the grate slams outward against the crate. The crate holds—but the lid you tore off earlier skitters across the floor, and the crate shifts again. A thin crack opens between crate and frame, just enough for a gun barrel to probe through.

A Saint’s pistol nose appears in the crack, searching for you, wobbling as the man tries to aim blind.

Niall grunts and levers again. The strike plate gives a sharp *POP*—one screw tears out entirely and spins across the concrete.

The threat is immediate: a gun is now pointed into the room through a growing gap, and the crate is losing its wedge. Niall has partially torn the latch hardware but the door is still shut.

*Simulation triggers: secret_Ed As I Can_0_e42de4, guard_Ed As I Can_0_9cd6de*

#### Turn 172 **[PLAYER]**

“Rosa—DOWN. Flat!”

I step in close to the jammed grate, angle the pistol at the crack, and fire once at the barrel/hand through the gap—then immediately kick the crate back into the frame with my heel and backpedal toward Niall. “How many screws left—talk to me!”

*Agent reasoning: That barrel in the gap is the first thing that can kill us; if I can disable the hand or gun, it buys Niall seconds to finish the door. I’ll keep Rosa low and out of the line while I take a close, dirty shot.*

#### Turn 173 **[GAME]**

“Down!” you bark, and Rosa drops like her strings got cut—flat to the concrete, hands over her head, skirt pooled around her knees.

You close the distance to the grate. The crack is narrow, but the pistol barrel is there, nosing in, hunting. You angle your shot and squeeze.

The report is deafening in the low room. Your round punches through the gap and clips metal—*PING*—then meat. The gun jerks back out of sight and a man howls, raw and shocked. His weapon clatters in the crawlspace, followed by frantic shuffling.

But the shot buys you only a blink.

The Saints answer immediately: a second muzzle flashes from the crack and a bullet snaps into the crate wood an inch from your knee, spraying splinters. Another round follows—lower—skipping off the concrete with a nasty whine and ricocheting into the far wall.

You kick the crate hard with your heel, driving it back into the frame. It thuds into place and the crack narrows again, choking off their line of fire. You backpedal, pistol still up, keeping your body between the grate and the others.

At the door, Niall is sweating and furious, pipe wedged into the latch side. He yanks, then slams his shoulder into the steel in the same motion.

“One’s out, two left—” he spits, eyes on the strike plate. “They’re long screws—old wood—if it strips, it strips—”

Behind you, the pry bar scrapes again. The crate shudders as they reset their leverage—more controlled now. A voice, calmer, meaner: “Stop pushing it. Split the box. Ax—bring the ax.”

You hear it: the hollow thump of someone crawling back, then the heavier cadence of boots repositioning in the tunnel.

Niall drives the pipe again. The strike plate bends; another screw squeals as it starts to pull—slow, stubborn.

Rosa stays flat, trembling, eyes squeezed shut.

Threat is escalating: they’ve switched tactics. Instead of forcing the grate, they’re about to chop the crate apart from the crawlspace side, which will remove your jam entirely and reopen a firing lane. The door is still locked, but one more screw is starting to give.

*Simulation triggers: secret_Ed As I Can_0_e42de4, guard_Ed As I Can_0_9cd6de*

#### Turn 174 **[PLAYER]**

I swallow the smoke in my throat and keep the pistol trained on the grate. “Niall—don’t baby it. Rip the damn latch clean, I don’t care if you take the frame with it.”

I drop to one knee by the crate and fire a quick shot through the smallest gap I can find, not to hit pretty—just to make them flinch—then I shove my free hand under the crate’s edge and drag it tighter to the frame. “Rosa—stay flat, and if that door pops, you crawl first.”

*Agent reasoning: The crate won’t hold once they start chopping, so I need to buy seconds and get that door open. I’ll force Niall to commit to ripping the latch while I keep the Saints’ heads down, even if it costs me nerves and bullets.*

#### Turn 175 **[GAME]**

Niall hears the edge in your voice and stops trying to be careful. He repositions the pipe higher, closer to the latch itself, and puts his whole body into it—boot braced, shoulder tight, face twisted with pain and spite.

You drop to a knee at the crate. There’s a hairline gap where wood meets iron. You shove the pistol in as far as it’ll go without losing it and fire.

The shot cracks inside the crawlspace like a drum. You don’t see who it hits, but you get what you wanted: a startled curse and a sudden scramble backward, boots and knees skidding on stone.

Then something answers from deeper in the tunnel—a different sound than a pry bar: the dull, heavy *thunk* of an axe head testing a swing.

You hook your fingers under the crate’s edge and drag. The crate scrapes, nails squealing against the grate frame, and you manage to tighten it back into the corner—your fingertips burning where the wood bites. It’s tighter, but you can feel the crate’s side panel flexing; if they start chopping, it won’t stay a wall for long.

At the door, Niall gives one last savage wrench.

Metal shrieks. The strike plate tears free with a ripping sound that’s half wood, half steel. The door doesn’t swing open clean—its latch side jumps outward an inch, then sticks, caught on a twisted lip of frame.

“Frame’s snagged!” Niall barks, yanking with his good hand. “It’s—come on—”

Rosa, still flat, crawls two inches in panic and freezes, looking to you like she’s waiting for permission to exist.

From the crawlspace: a voice, closer again, controlled and cold. “She’s in there. Don’t rush it.”

Then the axe hits the crate—*WHAM*—and the wood dents inward. Straw puffs out through a split like breath.

Threat is immediate and specific: they’re chopping the crate apart from the tunnel side. Your jam will fail in seconds, and once it does they’ll have a clear opening to shoot through. The steel door is partially freed but caught on broken frame wood; it needs one hard pull or shove to clear before the crate gives.

*Simulation triggers: secret_Ed As I Can_0_e42de4, guard_Ed As I Can_0_9cd6de*

#### Turn 176 **[PLAYER]**

I lunge to the steel door and slam my shoulder into the latch side, then grab the torn edge and wrench it like I’m trying to rip it off the wall. “Rosa—crawl, NOW—through the crack, don’t stand up!”

I shove my pistol into Niall’s hand as I pull. “You go right behind her—cover the hall. I’m last.”

*Agent reasoning: The crate won’t hold against an axe; the only real chance is forcing the door now. I’m protective of Rosa and I trust Niall’s grit, so I’ll throw my weight into the snagged frame while keeping them moving in order—Rosa first, then Niall, then me.*

#### Turn 177 **[GAME]**

You slam your shoulder into the latch side. Pain blooms down your arm, but the snag in the frame finally gives with a wet, splintering *CRACK*. The steel door swings inward a foot—then two—dragging a torn strip of wood with it like a broken tooth.

Cold, stale air rolls out of the corridor beyond: dust, oil, old paper.

“Move!” you snap.

Rosa doesn’t argue. She scrambles on her elbows and knees, keeping her head low like you ordered, and slips through the opening first, disappearing into the dim utility corridor.

You shove the pistol into Niall’s hand. He catches it clumsy with his injured fingers, winces, then nods once—grim, focused. He ducks through behind Rosa, half-turning immediately to aim down the hall the way you told him, breathing hard as he tries to steady the muzzle.

Behind you, the axe hits again—*WHAM*—and the crate’s side panel caves. Straw and a bottle neck burst through the split. The crate shifts, no longer a solid wedge.

A Saint’s hand punches through the broken wood, grabbing at the grate frame. A face flashes in the gap—cap brim, eyes bright with hate—then a second man crowds behind him with something long and dark: the axe handle.

You’re still in the room, last like you said, one hand on the torn edge of the door, the other empty. The corridor is open, but you’ve bought it with your gun: you don’t have it now.

From the hallway, Niall barks, “Eve—NOW!”

The Saints don’t wait. The grate heaves outward as the crate collapses inward. The opening widens to a fist, then a forearm. A pistol appears again through the wreckage, searching for a target.

Immediate threat: they have a firing lane into the room and are seconds from getting a man through the grate. You have a clear exit through the steel door, but you must cross the room unarmed while a gun is probing for you.

#### Turn 178 **[PLAYER]**

I yank the steel door wider and throw myself behind it, using it as a shield as I crouch low. “Saints!” I shout toward the grate, sharp and venomous. “You want me, come take me—” Then I duck and sprint through the doorway on hands and feet, keeping my head down as I scramble into the corridor after Rosa and Niall.

*Agent reasoning: I’m not dying in a back room for pride; I’ll use the door as cover, make them hesitate, and bolt low. If I can buy a heartbeat for Niall and Rosa, I will.*

#### Turn 179 **[GAME]**

You wrench the steel door wider until its hinges groan, then drop behind it, pressing your shoulder and cheek to cold metal. For a half-second it’s a wall between you and that widening grate.

Your shout snaps across the room. The Saints answer with action, not words.

A pistol barks through the wrecked crate. The first round slams into the steel door with a flat, brutal *CLANG* inches above your head, sending a shiver through the slab into your teeth. A second shot follows—lower—sparks skitter off the bottom edge and bite the concrete near your hand.

They’re aiming at the gap under the door now.

You duck even lower and go. Hands and feet, head tucked, you scramble through the doorway like you’re diving under a closing gate. Another shot cracks—this one catches the torn wooden frame, exploding a splintered chunk that whips past your ear and stings your cheek.

You clear the threshold and spill into the utility corridor, breath ragged, palms scraping gritty concrete. Behind you, the Saints’ voices rise, urgent and close, and the grate gives a final tortured screech as it’s forced wider.

In the corridor, Rosa is already halfway down, crawling then stumbling into a crouched run. Niall is posted just beyond the door, pistol up with both hands, trying to hold the sight picture despite his busted arm.

“Go!” he snaps at you, then fires once down toward the doorway behind you—not at you, but to discourage the first Saint who’s about to push through.

The shot echoes hard in the corridor. A man yells from the room you left—pain and anger—and then you hear boots hitting concrete: at least one Saint is through the grate now, moving fast toward the steel door you just used.

Threat is explicit: one or more Saints are now inside the basement room and closing on the corridor entrance. They have at least one pistol and an axe, and they know exactly which way you fled.

#### Turn 180 **[PLAYER]**

I grab Rosa by the back of her coat and shove her forward. “Keep low—don’t you stop.”

I tug Niall’s sleeve and hiss, “Fall back—one shot, then move, don’t play hero,” and I scan the corridor for the nearest side door, stairwell, or hard corner we can duck around.

*Agent reasoning: I’m unarmed and they’re right behind us; the only thing I can do is buy distance and find a way to break line-of-sight. Niall’s hurt—he can’t be our rear guard for long—so I need to get Rosa moving and find a door, a turn, anything to funnel them.*

#### Turn 181 **[GAME]**

Your fist knots in the back of Rosa’s coat and you shove. She stumbles, catches herself on the wall with her fingertips, then keeps moving—low, fast, breath whistling like she’s trying not to sob. She doesn’t stop again.

You catch Niall’s sleeve and yank him back a step. He flinches at the touch—injured arm—but the message lands. “Yeah,” he spits, jaw clenched. He backs up two short steps, pivots, and squeezes off a single round toward the steel doorway.

The shot punches the corridor with a sharp crack. A split-second later, a Saint’s silhouette fills the doorway behind you—hat brim and shoulders—then jerks back with a barked curse. Not dropped, but checked.

Niall doesn’t admire his work. He retreats, gun still up, moving sideways to keep his eyes on the threat while giving ground.

You scan fast.

Ten feet ahead on the right: a narrow side door with a frosted glass panel stenciled **“FOREMAN”**—its frame scarred, but the knob intact. The door is shut.

Another fifteen feet beyond that: the corridor bends hard left around a concrete corner. Past the corner you can see the bottom of a stairwell—metal steps rising, a bare bulb swinging slightly, throwing a strobe of light.

Behind you, boots slap into the corridor—two sets now, not one. One voice calls, “Down the hall!” Another answers, “Don’t shoot your own—”

A pistol muzzle flashes from the doorway. The round hits the corridor wall just above Niall’s shoulder, showering dust and plaster.

Immediate threat: two Saints are advancing into the corridor with at least one pistol, firing down the hall. You have a side office door close enough to grab, and a hard corner plus stairwell farther ahead that could break their line of sight if you reach it.

*Simulation triggers: secret_Ed As I Can_0_e42de4, guard_Ed As I Can_0_9cd6de*

#### Turn 182 **[PLAYER]**

“Forget that door—keep moving!” I hiss, shoving Rosa ahead harder as I herd her toward the left bend.

I grab a fistful of Niall’s coat and haul him with me. “Back to the corner—then up the stairs, quick as you can.” At the bend I drop low and flatten against the wall, listening for their boots and waiting to bolt the instant the line of fire breaks.

*Agent reasoning: The corner and stairwell are our best chance to break their line of sight; stopping to fiddle with the Foreman door could get us pinned in a dead-end office. I’ll keep Rosa moving and use the corner as cover, buying us seconds with noise and urgency rather than heroics.*

#### Turn 183 **[GAME]**

You drive Rosa forward and she shoots around the left bend first, shoulders hunched, one hand skimming the wall to keep balance. Niall comes with you, dragged more than guided—his boots scuffing as he tries not to jolt his bad arm.

The instant you hit the corner you drop and flatten to the concrete, cheek near the grit, listening.

The gunfire line breaks the moment you’re out of sight. The corridor behind you fills with hard, fast footfalls—then a Saint barks, “Corner—corner!”

A shot cracks anyway, blind-fired. It smacks the concrete edge above you with a sharp *PING* and spits stone dust into your hair. Too close, but it doesn’t tag you.

Rosa is already at the base of the stairwell ahead—metal steps bolted into the wall, climbing into a dim rectangle of light. She starts up on hands and feet, skirt snagging on a tread. She yanks it free and keeps going.

Niall reaches the first step and hesitates half a beat, trying to climb one-handed while keeping the pistol up. His breathing turns ugly with pain. He looks back over his shoulder at you, eyes wide.

From behind the corner, the Saints’ boots close in—now clearly three men by the rhythm, one heavier than the others. One of them laughs once, short and mean. “Got you penned, songbird.”

Then a new sound cuts under it: a metallic rattle from above—like a chain being drawn, or a latch being worked at the top of the stairwell.

Someone up there is moving the door.

If that door gets shut or barred, you’ll be trapped on the stairs with Saints coming from below. If it opens, whoever’s up there will see you first—friend or not.

#### Turn 184 **[PLAYER]**

I grab the stair rail and hiss up through my teeth, “Hey—whoever’s up there—don’t you lock that door! It’s Eve Marlowe, and I’m coming up with company you don’t want!”

Then I shove Niall up a step with my shoulder. “Move, damn you—keep that pistol pointed down.” I snatch a loose bit of rubble and whip it back around the corner hard, like I’m tossing a grenade, and dart onto the first steps right behind him.

*Agent reasoning: We can’t get bottled on the stairs; I need to force that top door decision—either ally opens or enemy reveals themselves—while buying Niall and Rosa seconds. I’m unarmed, but I can still bluff and make noise to control the moment.*

#### Turn 185 **[GAME]**

Your voice knifes up the stairwell, raw and tight. “Eve Marlowe—don’t you lock that door!”

Up top, the rattling stops dead.

A beat later, a man’s voice answers—close enough to carry, not close enough to see. “Marlowe?” Suspicion, and a quick edge of recognition. “You alone?”

You slam your shoulder into Niall and he lurches up a step, jaw clenched so hard it looks like it might crack. He keeps the pistol angled down the stairwell like you told him, but his wrist tremors with the effort.

You scoop a jagged chunk of concrete from the stairwell edge and whip it back around the corner. It clatters and skitters loudly down the corridor floor, striking the wall with a sharp *KRAK* like something heavier than it is.

The Saints react exactly the way you want for half a second.

“Jesus—!” one of them yelps, and their boots stutter. Another barks, “It’s not— it’s a rock, you idiot—!”

That half-second buys you two steps.

Then the heavier Saint commits. Boots hammer the corner and a broad shape leans into the bend, pistol outstretched. He fires up the stairwell on instinct.

The round slams into the metal rail beside your hand with a vicious *SMACK*, tearing a bright chip of steel and vibrating the whole railing. Your fingers go numb from the shock, but you’re not hit.

Niall answers with one shot downward. The muzzle flash lights his face. The Saint at the corner jerks back with a grunt—hit or grazed, you can’t tell—then disappears from view, replaced by another man’s shoulder as they crowd for the angle.

Above, the door at the top of the stairs opens a crack. Light spills down in a thin wedge. A face appears in it—pale, sweating, hair slicked back—Tommy Coyle’s, eyes wide and feral.

He’s not holding a gun. He’s holding the door with both hands like it weighs a ton.

“Eve,” he says, voice breaking. “Hurry. They’ll—” A shout from somewhere above him cuts him off, and Tommy flinches like someone just yanked a chain attached to his ribs.

Threat is immediate and specific: Saints are at the stairwell corner firing up; at least one is willing to shoot blindly. The top door is open only a crack and Tommy is being pressured by someone above to close it.

#### Turn 186 **[PLAYER]**

I snap up at Tommy, “Tommy—open it WIDER, now! Tell whoever’s got you: if that door shuts, I swear I’ll sing their name to every copper on the docks.”

Then I lean down the stairs and bark toward the corner, “You Saints keep firing and you’ll hit your own—there’s three of you stacked like cheap suits!” I grab Niall by the back of his coat and haul him up another step. “Rosa—GO, keep climbing—don’t look back.”

*Agent reasoning: Tommy’s our only way through, but someone’s forcing his hand; we need that door fully open and we need the Saints’ angle broken long enough to get Rosa and Niall through. I’ll bluff leverage on whoever’s above and buy seconds by making the Saints hesitate with a threat.*

#### Turn 187 **[GAME]**

“Tommy—open it wider, now!”

Tommy’s hands tremble on the door edge. He swallows hard, then forces it another few inches. The wedge of light broadens, spilling down the stairs and catching Rosa’s face as she climbs—eyes blown wide, mascara streaking.

From above Tommy, a second voice snaps, tight and controlled: “Shut it. Now.” You don’t see the speaker, only a shadow crossing behind him.

Tommy flinches, but your threat lands. He blurts upward, fast and desperate: “She’ll talk to the cops—she knows names—” His voice cracks on the last word.

The unseen person above answers with a low, cold laugh. “So do we.”

Down below, you bark at the Saints about their stack. For a moment, it works: their firing stops, replaced by angry, hurried shuffling as they try to spread out.

Then the heavy one at the corner snarls, “Don’t listen to her—MOVE!” He doesn’t fire again—he advances.

A hand appears around the bend, not with a pistol but with a squat bottle. The bottle arcs up toward the stairwell, rag stuffed in its mouth burning bright.

It hits two steps below you and bursts.

Flame blooms across the metal treads with a wet *WHOOMPH*, licking up fast—cheap spirits and oil. Heat punches your shins. Smoke curls up the stairwell, harsh and sweet, and the fire starts climbing the steps toward you, fed by the spill running downhill.

You haul Niall up another step; he nearly goes down on his knee, catches himself, and keeps climbing, teeth bared. Rosa doesn’t stop—she scrambles higher, coughing as the first smoke reaches her.

Above, Tommy yanks the door wider—now open enough for one person to squeeze through at a time—but he’s losing leverage. Something tugs him from behind, and his shoulders jerk back as if someone’s grabbed his belt.

Threats now: fire is spreading up from below, cutting off retreat and forcing you upward fast; Saints are closing the bend behind the flames; and someone above is physically pulling Tommy away from the door, risking it slamming shut again before you reach it.

#### Turn 188 **[PLAYER]**

I rip off my scarf and slap it over my mouth and nose, then yank my flask free and splash what’s left down onto the burning steps to knock the flame back just enough to climb. “Rosa—through the door, now! Tommy—HOLD IT!” I hook my arm under Niall’s good side and half-drag, half-shove him up, and as I pass the door I snap my free hand out to grab Tommy’s wrist and haul him toward us.

*Agent reasoning: Fire’s eating the stairs and that door’s about to slam; I need to get Rosa through, keep Niall moving, and buy one breath of time by choking the flames or at least making the Saints hesitate.*

#### Turn 189 **[GAME]**

You clamp the scarf over your mouth and nose and it helps—smoke still burns your eyes, but you can breathe without gagging.

You whip the flask out and splash what’s left onto the nearest tongues of flame. The alcohol doesn’t smother it—if anything, it flares for an instant, a bright hungry lick that crawls sideways across the spill. But the liquid also breaks up the pooled fuel on two steps, thinning it just enough that the fire stutters there instead of rolling solid.

It buys you a narrow, ugly path: hot metal, patchy flame, and a lot of smoke.

“Rosa—through the door, now!”

Rosa hits the top, shoulders first, and squeezes through the crack. Inside, she stumbles and falls out of sight with a yelp.

You get Niall up the last few steps by brute force—his good side under your arm, his boots scraping. He’s coughing hard now, pistol still in his hand but lowered, more dead weight than threat.

At the doorway, you snap your hand out and catch Tommy’s wrist.

You feel the answer immediately: a violent tug from above yanks him the other way. Tommy’s skin is slick with sweat; your grip almost slips. He cries out, “Eve—!”

You plant your heel on the top step and haul. For half a second it’s a rope pull—your shoulder screams, Niall lurches into you, and the scarf shifts, letting smoke bite your throat.

Then Tommy comes free—hard.

He stumbles into the stairwell and collides with you and Niall in a three-body knot at the threshold. The door swings wider with the sudden release—

—and a hand from inside slams it inward, trying to close it on you.

The edge catches Niall across the shoulder and spins him sideways with a pained grunt. His pistol clatters once against the doorframe but doesn’t drop.

Through the widening gap, you finally see the one who tried to take Tommy: a Vice Bureau officer in shirtsleeves, tie loose, badge chain glinting at his belt. His face is soot-smudged, eyes hard, and he’s got a revolver up at chest height.

He snaps, “Nobody else comes through.”

Below you, the Saints shout through the smoke—closer now—and the fire is still climbing, feeding on the spill you didn’t fully break. You’ve got seconds before the stairwell becomes a chimney.

#### Turn 190 **[PLAYER]**

I shove my shoulder into the door to keep it from closing and glare straight at the Vice man. “Then quit pointing that thing at me and help—unless you want three Saints and a fire in your lap.”

I hook my arm around Niall’s coat and drag him through the gap, then snatch Tommy by the collar and yank him inside after us. “Rosa—find me something heavy to bar this damn door!”

*Agent reasoning: The stairwell’s turning into an oven and the Saints are right there; arguing won’t stop a bullet. I need that door open now, and the quickest lever is the cop’s fear of a mess and my willingness to make one.*

#### Turn 191 **[GAME]**

Your shoulder hits the door and stops it mid-swing. The Vice man’s revolver wavers an inch, then steadies again—more from habit than intent. He looks past you, down the stairwell, and the orange pulse of the fire reflects in his eyes.

“Saints?” he spits, like the word tastes bad. Another beat, and he makes a decision he’ll hate later: he drops the muzzle and reaches for the door edge with his free hand. “Move, then.”

You hook Niall by the coat and drag. Niall stumbles through the gap, half-falling onto the floorboards inside. He lands hard on his hip and hisses through his teeth, smoke cough turning wet. The room you’ve entered isn’t an office—it’s a narrow utility space off the roof bulkhead: tar-papered walls, a mop sink, a coil of hose, a metal shelving unit with paint cans and rags. One small window is painted over from the inside.

Tommy comes next—your fist in his collar. He trips over Niall’s legs and scrambles upright, wide-eyed, staring at the Vice man like he’s seeing a ghost.

Rosa, already inside, is on her hands and knees near the shelving, hacking coughs into her sleeve. At your bark she pushes up, frantic, and starts yanking at whatever she can reach. A paint can clatters. A bundle of rags spills. She grabs a squat iron valve wheel off a shelf—heavy but awkward—and drags it toward the door.

The Vice man braces the door with you, then glances down at your hands and Niall and Tommy in a quick tally. “That’s it,” he says, voice flat. “Door shuts after—”

A gunshot cracks from the stairwell below—close enough to make the painted window vibrate. Then a Saint’s voice, hoarse through smoke: “UP THERE! SHE WENT UP!”

Heat and smoke surge into the doorway gap as the stairwell turns into a draft. The fire isn’t just below anymore—you can see flame licking the underside of the top landing through the crack, trying to climb into this room.

Rosa reaches you with the valve wheel. “This—this heavy enough?”

The immediate threat is the Saints reaching the top of the stairwell in seconds, with smoke and fire pushing them upward and into you if the door isn’t sealed and barred.

#### Turn 192 **[PLAYER]**

“Yeah—jam it in, NOW.” I snatch the valve wheel from Rosa and slam it down at the base of the door as a wedge, then shove my weight into the door until it bites tight. 

I bark at the Vice man, “Put your shoulder on it—unless you’re planning to arrest a bonfire,” and kick the hose coil loose with my heel. “Rosa, wrap that hose around the handle if there is one—anything to keep it from giving.” 

Over my shoulder I snap at Niall, “Get up—back from the door. If it bursts open, shoot low and don’t hit me.”

*Agent reasoning: We need that door shut and sealed immediately or the Saints and fire pour in; I’ll use the valve wheel as a wedge/bar and the hose as backup, while keeping the Vice man committed and getting Rosa/Niall away from the choke point.*

#### Turn 193 **[GAME]**

You rip the valve wheel from Rosa and slam it down into the gap at the base of the door. It bites—metal on wood—then skitters a half-inch as the door shudders from a hit on the other side. You throw your weight forward and grind it in again until it wedges tight enough to hold.

The Vice man hesitates at your order, jaw working like he’s swallowing pride. Then he steps in and plants his shoulder beside yours. “If this goes bad,” he mutters, “it’s on you.” He leans hard.

The door bucks—once, twice—heavy bodies on the stairwell side. A Saints voice snarls through the crack, close and muffled: “Kick it! KICK—”

A third impact hits higher, near the latch. The frame creaks; dust shakes loose from the tar-paper seam. The valve wheel holds, but it’s not pretty—every shove makes it grind and threaten to spit out.

You kick the hose coil loose. It unspools across the floor with a rubbery slap.

Rosa darts in, coughing, and finds the handle—a simple metal pull. She loops the hose around it and then around a short pipe riser by the mop sink, cinching it like a tourniquet. “Hold—hold—” she gasps, yanking until her knuckles whiten. The hose stretches but doesn’t snap.

Niall drags himself backward on his elbows, then gets a knee under him. He brings his pistol up two-handed, barrel angled toward the bottom hinge line like you said—low, ready, shaking from pain and smoke. “I’m up,” he wheezes. “Just—don’t let them—”

On the other side, the fire finally finds the gap. Smoke pours in around the jamb in a solid stream, and a thin orange lick curls under the door, tasting the utility room floor. The heat coming through is immediate—like an oven door cracked open.

Then something changes: the pounding stops for half a heartbeat, replaced by hurried shouting and a scrape like someone dragging something metal up the stairwell.

The Vice man’s eyes flick to you. “They’re not kicking anymore,” he says, low. “They’re bringing a tool.”

*Simulation triggers: secret_Ed As I Can_0_e42de4, guard_Ed As I Can_0_9cd6de, watcher_Ed As I Can_0_ccf26f*

#### Turn 194 **[PLAYER]**

I peel off the door long enough to scan the room—window, ceiling, anything. “Tool means they’re coming through. Where’s this lead—roof? Another exit?”  

I grab the hose near the sink and twist the tap, trying to get water running; if it spits even a little, I aim it low at the door crack to kill that licking flame. “Rosa—help me with the hose. Niall—if you see metal bite the latch, put two rounds through the hinge line.”  

Then I lean in close to the Vice man, voice like a threat and a plea at once. “You want to pin this on me later, fine—right now you’re our way out. You got keys? A way to the roof?”

*Agent reasoning: A tool means they’ll pry the latch or chop hinges; holding the door will fail. Eve’s a survivor—she’ll pivot to escape routes, use the hose/water if possible, and try to turn the Vice into a reluctant ally while keeping Rosa moving and Niall ready.*

#### Turn 195 **[GAME]**

You peel off the door and sweep the utility room with a fast, desperate look.

There’s a ceiling hatch panel—painted shut, with old pry marks—set between two joists. The painted-over window is small, wired glass, and the paint is thick enough you can’t see through it. The only other way out you can spot is the bulkhead door you came in through… which leads back onto the roof.

You twist the mop-sink tap.

Nothing.

It gives a dry metallic squeal and spits a single brown cough of air that smells like rust, then goes dead. No pressure. Either the line’s cut, the building’s feed is shut, or the whole place is running off a tank that’s already empty.

The flame under the door keeps licking in, thin and persistent, fed by the draft. Smoke is worse now—your scarf helps, but your eyes water hard.

Rosa grabs the hose anyway and helps you aim it at the crack on instinct. It’s just rubber in your hands—no water, no weight. “It’s dead,” she says, voice breaking. “No water—Eve—”

On the other side of the door: metal bites wood. A harsh scraping, then a thunk-thunk like a pry bar testing purchase at the latch. The hose loop around the handle tightens and creaks as the door flexes.

Niall shifts, shoulders squared despite the pain, and aims low like you told him. “I see it,” he rasps. He doesn’t fire yet—waiting for a clean angle through the gap.

You lean in on the Vice man.

He answers without looking at you, eyes locked on the door seam. “Keys, yeah.” He pats his pocket like it’s still there. “Roof’s out that bulkhead. But the roof’s not empty.”

Another hard pry. The latch side of the door bows inward a fraction. The valve wheel wedge shudders.

The Vice man finally turns his head enough to meet your stare. “You want out? We go up. But if I open that bulkhead, somebody up there will hear it. And if the Saints don’t get us, the Bureau will.”

A sharp crack—wood fibers giving at the latch—telegraphs the next pry will open a gap big enough for a hand, then a gun.

The immediate threat is the Saints forcing the latch within seconds.

#### Turn 196 **[PLAYER]**

“Alright—roof, then. But you go first, Officer: you open it, you listen, you eat the first bullet if your friends are up there.”

I grab a paint can off the shelf and shove it into Rosa’s hands. “On my mark, smash it at the door—make a mess, slow their feet.” Then I nod to Niall. “Now—two rounds. Low. Ruin that pry bar hand.”

As the shots go, I hook my arm around Tommy’s collar again and drag him toward the bulkhead door, pressing close to the Vice man. “Keys out. Open it quiet, and if you double-cross me, I’ll make sure the Saints don’t miss.”

*Agent reasoning: The door won’t hold and we’ve got no water; the roof is risky but it’s movement. I’m not letting the Vice man steer me into a trap, so I’ll force him to lead while we prep a distraction and buy a second with Niall’s shots.*

#### Turn 197 **[GAME]**

The Vice man’s mouth tightens at your terms, but he nods once—short, angry. He pulls a ring of keys from his pocket, already half-crouched by the bulkhead door to keep his silhouette low.

You shove the paint can into Rosa’s hands. It’s a gallon can—heavy. She almost drops it, catches it against her hip, and coughs out, “On your mark.”

Niall takes your nod like permission he’s been begging for. He fires twice.

The first shot cracks so loud in the tiny room your ears ring. The second comes a heartbeat later. Both rounds go low, through the bottom panel of the door near the hinge line. Splinters jump. On the other side, there’s a sharp yelp—more surprise than agony—and the pry-scrape stops abruptly.

A metal bar clatters down the stairwell steps.

Then a voice—different than before, higher—shouts, “He’s shooting through! Back—BACK!”

The door doesn’t open, but the pressure against it returns as a shoulder hits it once, testing. The valve wheel wedge holds. The hose loop creaks, stretched tight around the handle.

You hook Tommy by the collar and haul him toward the bulkhead. He stumbles, wheezing, eyes wild, but he goes.

At the bulkhead, the Vice man fits a key into the lock. He tries to turn it slow.

The lock resists—stiff with weather and grit. The key scrapes metal, loud in your ears because everything else has gone suddenly quiet except the fire’s hungry hiss.

Up on the roof side, someone answers that scrape with a soft, unmistakable sound: a shoe scuffing on gravel-tar, close to the door.

A man’s voice, calm and bored, calls through the bulkhead from outside: “Vice? That you in there?”

The Vice man freezes with the key half-turned, eyes flicking to you.

Behind you, the stairwell side goes from prying to planning: you hear hurried footsteps retreating down a few steps, then the wet glug of something being poured, followed by a match-strike hiss.

Rosa, clutching the paint can, whispers, “They’re… they’re lighting it.”

Immediate threats:
- On the stairwell side, the Saints are about to feed accelerant into the doorway/fire, which will turn this room into a blowtorch.
- On the roof side, someone is posted right outside the bulkhead and has identified the Vice man by voice.

#### Turn 198 **[PLAYER]**

I lean close to the bulkhead and pitch my voice rough and official, trying to mimic the Vice man’s cadence. “Yeah—open up, you idiot, we’ve got smoke and Saints on the stair!”

Then I grab the Vice man by his tie and yank him tight to the door, hissing, “Turn it—NOW,” and as soon as it clicks I drive my shoulder into the bulkhead to burst it outward, using him like cover while I shove Tommy and Rosa through first. “Move, move—Rosa, paint can ready—if he’s there, you swing.”

*Agent reasoning: Fire’s about to turn this room into an oven, so we can’t stay; the roof guard recognizing the Vice means we need deception and speed, and I’ll risk a messy shove to buy seconds.*

#### Turn 200 **[PLAYER]**

I press my mouth to the bulkhead and bark in my best clipped-cop tone, “Yeah—open it, we’ve got smoke and Saints on the stair!”  

Then I fist the Vice man’s tie and haul him close. “Turn the key—now,” I hiss, and the second it gives I slam the bulkhead outward and shove Tommy through first, then Rosa with the paint can raised like a club. “Go—move!”

*Agent reasoning: Something glitched; I’ll repeat the last move but simplify it and make sure we act fast before the Saints light us up.*

#### Turn 201 **[GAME]**

Your bark through the bulkhead lands—there’s a half-beat of hesitation outside, like the man is deciding whether to believe you.

The Vice man’s hand shakes once on the key. You yank his tie tight enough to choke off argument.

The lock finally gives with a gritty click.

You drive your shoulder into the bulkhead and it bursts outward—hard—slamming into something solid on the other side.

A man grunts and staggers back. He’d been posted close, ear near the seam. He isn’t in uniform—dock coat, flat cap—but he’s got a Bureau-style shoulder holster under it, and his pistol is already halfway out when the door hits him.

You shove Tommy through first. Tommy tumbles onto the roof gravel, catching himself on his palms, coughing so hard he nearly vomits.

Rosa comes next, paint can raised. She swings on instinct at the shape in front of her.

The can connects with the man’s forearm and the side of his jaw in a single ugly arc. Metal rings. He cries out, gun hand jerking wide; the pistol goes off once—

The shot cracks into the bulkhead frame above your head, showering splinters and tar grit down onto your hair and shoulders.

The man stumbles, trying to bring the gun back on line. He’s dazed, not down.

The Vice man lurches forward into the doorway as you use him for cover, and the roof air hits you like a slap—cold, wet, and clean compared to the smoke behind.

But the roof isn’t empty.

To your left, near a low vent stack, a second figure rises from a crouch—this one in a dark rain cape, rifle leveled, watching the doorway like he’s been waiting for the exact moment it opens. He doesn’t fire yet; he tracks the movement, controlled.

From behind you, the stairwell side flares: the Saints’ accelerant catches. A sudden whoof of orange light blooms under the utility-room door, and heat punches through the bulkhead opening at your back. The room you just left starts to roar.

Threats, immediate and concrete:
- On the roof: one armed man (pistol) is wounded/dazed but still up at arm’s length; a second man has a rifle trained on the doorway and is steady.
- Behind you: the utility room is about to become untenable as the fire surges; staying in the threshold will cook you and cut off retreat in seconds.

#### Turn 202 **[PLAYER]**

I lunge for the dazed pistol man, hooking an arm around his throat and yanking him in front of me, my other hand clamping his gun wrist down. “Rifle—EASY! You squeeze, you kill your own man.”

Over his shoulder I snap at Rosa and Tommy, “Get left—vent stack, now! Low!” Then I bark at the Vice man through clenched teeth, “Tell him to stand down—tell him or I walk this one right into your line of fire.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re trapped between a rifle and a fire; talking buys a second, but I need the rifleman’s muzzle off us. The lookout with the pistol is close enough to use as a shield, ugly as that is. I’ll also get Rosa and Tommy moving away from the doorway so one burst doesn’t drop us all.*

#### Turn 203 **[GAME]**

You hit the dazed pistol man before he can reset his feet. Your forearm snakes under his chin and you haul him back into you; his breath barks once, then turns into a strangled rasp. Your other hand clamps his gun wrist down hard against his ribs. The pistol’s muzzle points uselessly at tar and gravel.

The rifleman by the vent stack reacts on training: the rifle comes up tighter, cheek welded to stock. But he doesn’t fire—because you’ve put his line through his own man’s spine.

“Easy,” you warn.

He answers without moving his aim. “Let him go.” Flat, controlled. No panic—like he’s done this in alleys before.

Rosa and Tommy scramble left when you snap at them. Tommy crawls, coughing, dragging a knee that doesn’t want to bend. Rosa stays low, paint can hugged to her chest now, eyes huge as she scoots behind the vent stack.

The Vice man hesitates in the bulkhead mouth, heat washing over him from behind. The fire inside surges again; the doorway vomits smoke and a lick of orange that curls up the bulkhead frame. He flinches like it burned his eyelashes.

You bark at him to talk the rifle down.

The Vice man swallows, then forces his voice out toward the rifleman: “Eddie—hold it! Don’t shoot!”

The rifleman’s muzzle shifts a fraction—not lowering, just adjusting—so it’s still on you but no longer pinned to the hostage’s head. “That ain’t Vice,” he says. “That’s the Lark girl.”

Your hostage bucks once, trying to stomp your foot and peel your arm. You tighten; his face purples at the edges, and his pistol hand spasms against your grip.

From the bulkhead behind you comes a sharp, wet crack—wood giving way—followed by a rush of flame that punches outward. The utility-room interior is starting to flash; the threshold is becoming a chimney.

The rifleman glances once at the growing firelight and makes a decision. He raises his voice, not to you—to someone farther off on the roofline: “Crowe! It’s her—she’s got a man!”

A woman’s voice answers from the darkness beyond the vent stacks—closer than you’d like, amused and cold: “I heard.”

Now you’ve got:
- a rifle trained on you at mid-range,
- a hostage thrashing in your arms,
- fire behind you cutting off the bulkhead fast,
- and someone named Crowe closing in on the roof.

#### Turn 204 **[PLAYER]**

I clamp down harder, dragging the hostage sideways toward the vent stack, keeping his spine square in the rifle’s line. “Eddie—if Crowe wants me so bad, she can come take me herself. You shoot, you’re burying your pal for her.”

I shout over my shoulder, “Rosa—Tommy—keep crawling, find the next hatch or stair, don’t look back!” Then, to the Vice man, eyes cutting like a razor: “Get off that damn doorway before you catch, and tell me where this roof goes—other stairs, ladder, anything—NOW.”

*Agent reasoning: The fire is about to cut us off, and a rifle plus this Crowe means we’re seconds from getting boxed in. I need leverage and space—use the hostage to force a retreat toward cover and get Rosa/Tommy moving, while trying to needle Eddie’s loyalty against Crowe/Bureau.*

#### Turn 205 **[GAME]**

You drag the hostage sideways, boots skidding on wet gravel, until the vent stack is at your flank. You keep his back square to Eddie’s rifle like a shield.

Eddie’s jaw works. He doesn’t lower the rifle, but his trigger finger eases—white-knuckled restraint. “Crowe don’t bury her own,” he calls back at you. “She makes examples.”

Your hostage makes a desperate, ugly move—he throws his head back, smashing the crown of his skull into your cheekbone. Stars pop at the edge of your vision. Your grip holds, but it loosens a fraction; his gun wrist twitches, trying to angle the muzzle up.

Rosa and Tommy keep crawling left, exactly like you ordered. Tommy disappears behind a low skylight curb; Rosa follows, paint can scraping tar.

The Vice man jerks back from the bulkhead as the fire belches again. The bulkhead frame is actively burning now; tar bubbles and spits. He coughs hard, eyes watering, and staggers onto the roof proper.

He spits out the answer you demanded, fast and panicked: “North side—there’s a service ladder down to the catwalk over the loading bay. And—” he points with a shaking hand past the vent stacks “—a roof hatch by the water tank. Leads to the upper landing—if it ain’t chained.”

Before you can press him, movement cuts across the roofline.

Crowe shows herself: a lean silhouette in a dark coat, hat brim shedding rain, coming in low behind a row of vents so Eddie’s rifle never has to swing far. She’s not rushing; she’s closing like she owns the distance. In her right hand, something small and pale flashes—wire or chain—held loose, ready.

She calls out, voice calm as a hymn: “Eve Marlowe. Let the boy breathe and I’ll let your friends keep their knees.”

Eddie’s rifle stays trained, but now it’s not just a threat—it’s a bracket, holding you in place while Crowe angles to cut you off from the ladder route.

Behind you, the bulkhead opening vomits thicker smoke; the doorway is no longer a viable retreat. In another few breaths, the heat will force anyone near it to the ground or off the roof.

Immediate threats are now clear:
- Crowe is within a few strides of striking distance, circling to block escape routes.
- Eddie maintains a firing line and is steady.
- Your hostage is still fighting and trying to bring his pistol up.
- Fire has effectively sealed the bulkhead.

#### Turn 206 **[PLAYER]**

I wrench the pistol hard, twisting his wrist until it pops and the gun skitters away on the tar, then I shove him backward into Eddie’s line with a snarl. “Fetch.”

I don’t wait to see if it buys me mercy— I bolt low toward the water tank hatch, calling over my shoulder to Crowe, “You want me, Crowe? Keep up,” and I shout for Rosa and Tommy, “Hatch by the tank—MOVE!”

*Agent reasoning: Crowe’s closing to take me alive and Eddie’s got me bracketed; I need distance and cover more than leverage. The hostage is turning into a liability with that pistol, so I’ll disarm him and use him as a thrown problem to break Eddie’s aim, then run for the water-tank hatch before Crowe can get her wire on me.*

#### Turn 207 **[GAME]**

You torque the hostage’s wrist down and out.

There’s a wet, sick pop—his scream comes a beat later. The pistol slips free of his fingers and skitters across the tar in a short, scraping arc, stopping near the base of a vent.

You shove him backward toward Eddie’s sightline. He stumbles, clutching his ruined wrist to his chest, eyes blown wide with pain.

“Fetch,” you snarl—and you go.

You drop low and bolt for the water-tank hatch, boots slipping once on rain-slick gravel before you catch yourself on a hand and keep moving.

Eddie’s rifle snaps a hair to follow you, but his own man lurching into the lane fouls the shot. Eddie barks, “Get down!” and doesn’t fire—yet.

Crowe moves immediately. Not chasing straight—cutting angle. She sprints in a shallow arc to beat you to the hatch line, coat tails snapping, that pale length of wire/chain swinging ready at her side.

Behind you, the injured man half-falls, half-crawls toward his gun with his good hand, teeth bared. Eddie shifts his weight like he’s about to step in and cover him.

Rosa and Tommy, hearing you, break from cover and scramble the direction you shouted—low, fast, panicked. Tommy’s limp makes him slower; Rosa grabs his sleeve and yanks him along.

You reach the hatch: a squat metal door set into the roof near the tank’s iron legs. There’s a chain on it—looped through the handle—and a cheap padlock, already rust-bitten.

Crowe is closing from your right, maybe ten yards and shrinking. Eddie’s rifle is recovering its lane as his man clears it.

The immediate threat is simple and brutal:
- The hatch is chained and locked; you can’t just drop through.
- Crowe will be on you in seconds.
- Eddie now has a clearer shot as you’re pinned at the hatch.

#### Turn 208 **[PLAYER]**

I duck hard behind the water tank’s iron legs, putting metal between me and Eddie’s rifle, and rip off a loose chunk of tarred gravel/brick from the roof edge. “Rosa—Tommy—get on me, now!” I bark, then I slam the makeshift club down on the padlock and chain like I’m ringing a bell, over and over.  

Without looking up, I spit toward Crowe, “You always come with a leash, Crowe, or is that just for girls you can’t scare?” and if she gets within arm’s reach I whip a bootful of wet gravel at her face and lunge back into the lock again.

*Agent reasoning: I’m cornered at a locked hatch with a rifle on me and Crowe rushing—no time for finesse. I’ll use the tank legs as cover from Eddie and gamble on brute force: smash the lock/chain with whatever’s at hand, and if Crowe closes, I’ll kick gravel/strike dirty to buy a second.*

#### Turn 209 **[GAME]**

You duck behind the water tank’s iron legs. The thick, riveted supports cut Eddie’s line clean; his rifle barrel tracks, but there’s no shot without stepping wide.

You wrench at the roof edge and get a fist-sized chunk of tarred brick and gravel. It’s ugly and heavy. You bring it down on the padlock.

First strike: a metallic *clang* that rings through the rain.
Second: the lock jumps, but holds.
Third: the chain bites into the hatch handle and sprays rust dust.

Rosa and Tommy scramble toward you. Tommy’s breathing is a ragged saw; Rosa is half-dragging him, shoes slipping. They’re still a few strides out.

Crowe closes to within a few yards, then slows—smart. She doesn’t rush into your swing. The pale thing in her hand is clearer now: a short length of fine chain with a weighted end, like a sap made for bones and breath. She keeps it low, ready to snap up.

“You talk pretty when you’re cornered,” she says, voice steady. “Doesn’t change the math.”

You spit the line about her leash without looking up and keep hammering.

The padlock finally gives—not cleanly. On the next blow, the shackle twists and cracks, and the lock body splits. The chain slumps loose across the hatch.

At the exact moment the lock breaks, Eddie steps wide left to re-find an angle around the tank legs. He gets a slice of you—shoulder and head—between iron uprights. He doesn’t take a careful shot. He fires once, quick.

The bullet whines off iron with a vicious *ping* and throws a hot fleck that stings your upper arm like a cigarette kiss. Not a through-and-through—more a grazing burn and torn fabric—but it jolts you.

Crowe uses the gunshot as cover. She surges in the last steps.

You scoop a bootful of wet gravel and whip it up. It splatters across her cheek and into one eye. She hisses and turns her face away, blinking hard—but she’s already committed. The weighted chain snaps out anyway, low and fast, aiming for your wrist/hand on the hatch.

Rosa reaches the tank legs just as the chain whistles past her shoulder. She yelps and ducks. Tommy drops to his knees, scrambling for the hatch handle with shaking hands.

The hatch is now unchained and can be opened—but Crowe is in striking distance, Eddie has a partial angle again, and the Saints man with the busted wrist is still somewhere behind you on the roof, not out of this yet.

Vesper Lorne grew up in the soot-stained backrooms of a decaying coastal metropolis, learning early that secrets breed faster than mold. A freelance arcane investigator with a weakness for asking the wrong questions in the right places, they prowl crime scenes and candlelit salons alike, cataloging the city’s magic with clinical curiosity and a razor-dry wit. Inquisitive, stubborn, and infuriatingly perceptive, Vesper keeps tangling with a rival enforcer from the shadow court—equal parts threat and temptation. Their goal: expose the hidden engine behind the city’s cursed romances and corpses before it swallows them, preferably without falling for the one person sworn to stop them.

#### Turn 9 **[GAME]**

Morning in **Gullhook Row**, Brinewick’s dockside warren, arrives as a dim gray smear behind salt fog. Your office sits above a shuttered bait shop, the stairwell smelling of fish-oil and cheap violet incense. Outside, a Mourning Office checkpoint bell clinks on the corner, and the gaslamps still burn like they forgot it’s day.

You’re at your desk with yesterday’s case photos spread under a cracked magnifier. A thin line of chalk dust marks where you tested for residue sigils, and your coat is still damp at the cuffs from leaning over seawall stones. You’re scraping wax from a seal with a scalpel, careful not to tear the paper—old habit from an archivist’s backroom, where the truth was always folded small.

Three soft taps land on your door. Not knuckles. A mourner’s code.

When you open it, the hall is empty. On the floor sits a **Civic Mourning Office satchel**, salt-damp, tagged with your name in immaculate ink. The strap is tied with **dock-twine** you recognize from the Drownmarket piers. Inside: a grief permit stamped **UNREGISTERED**, still tacky as if rushed; a **Sableglass Theater** masque invitation that leaks perfume into your fingertips; and a shard of **black glass** wrapped in tar paper. You tilt the shard toward the window. The reflection is wrong—your desk is there, but the shadows don’t match. For a second they arrange into a lovers’ sigil you’ve only seen half-scraped off alley brick before the “Emergency Decency Audit” crews arrived.

From the street below, a clerk’s voice carries through the fog: “Audit sweep moving east. Seal the next block. Confiscate papers.” The checkpoint bell clinks again, closer this time.

The satchel is contraband, the permit could get you through sealed streets, and the invitation is a timed lure. You’re standing in your doorway with evidence that shouldn’t exist and footsteps coming up the stairs.

#### Turn 10 **[PLAYER]**

I scoop the satchel inside and lock the door, sliding the chain on—then press the black glass shard to my palm and whisper a quick reveal-thread to see what kind of lovers’ sigil it’s echoing. After a glance, I shove the shard and invitation into the hollowed ledger in my desk and keep the grief permit handy, moving to the door. “One moment—Mourning Office business,” I call, trying to sound bored and official.

*Agent reasoning: Audit boots on the stairs means I need to hide contraband fast, but I’m too curious not to sample the magic on that black glass and invitation; the permit might be my best bluff if I get cornered.*

#### Turn 11 **[GAME]**

The satchel’s leather leaves a wet salt print on your floorboards as you yank it in and throw the lock. The chain slides home with a metallic cough.

You press the black glass shard to your palm. It’s colder than seawater in winter. When you whisper the reveal-thread, the shard answers with a faint vibration that climbs your bones like a tuning fork. A hairline cut opens where the edge kisses skin—no gush, just a bead of blood that the glass seems eager to drink.

In the shard’s reflection, your office shadows detach from their corners and braid together into a sigil: two figures back-to-back, each holding the other’s throat with a ribbon. The ribbon knots into a lantern shape at the center—**a Lacquered Lantern binding mark**—but the outer ring is municipal: tidy little registry ticks like those on Mourning Office forms. It isn’t just romance. It’s *filed* romance.

The perfume from the invitation thickens as you focus on it—violet-amber ash, sweet enough to make your tongue feel slow. For half a second, the printed masquerade text seems to shift, as if it’s trying to replace your name with someone else’s.

Footsteps reach your landing.

You slide shard and invitation into the hollowed ledger in your desk. The moment the ledger closes, the room feels fractionally warmer, like you’ve shut a window on the sea. You keep the grief permit in hand—its stamp reads **UNREGISTERED** in red, the ink still slightly raised.

You move to the door and call out, bored and crisp: “One moment—Mourning Office business.”

On the other side, a pause. Then a man’s voice, young, careful, trained to sound harmless.

“Registrar’s assistant. **Tollin Wreave**. Audit support.” Paper rustles. “We’re verifying permits on this stair. I’ll need to see yours through the gap, Investigator Lorne.”

Something thin slides against the wood near the latch—metal, testing, not forcing. A second set of steps stops one flight below and stays there, silent.

Wreave adds, softer: “Chain stays on. Just… show the stamp. Quick as breath.”

If you open the door more than the chain allows, they’ll have a line of sight into your office. If you don’t show it, they can mark you noncompliant and call in the checkpoint bell.

```

#### Turn 12 **[PLAYER]**

I open the door only to the chain’s bite and slide the grief permit into view, thumb covering the “UNREGISTERED” like it’s an old coffee stain. “There. Stamp’s clean—so why are you testing my latch, Tollin?” I angle my head toward the stairwell. “And tell your friend below to stop holding their breath. It’s making the building nervous.”

*Agent reasoning: I want to buy time and learn who’s really on the stairs; I’ll comply just enough to avoid escalation while trying to catch a glimpse and probe for the second person.*

#### Turn 13 **[GAME]**

The door opens to the chain’s limit, giving you a wedge of foggy stairwell and Tollin Wreave’s face—too clean for this building, hair combed like he’s expecting a photograph. He’s holding a clipboard and a Mourning satchel; his eyes snap to the permit the instant it appears.

Your thumb hides the red **UNREGISTERED**, but the raised ink catches the stairwell light at the edge of your nail.

Tollin’s gaze lingers there a fraction too long. The thin metal you felt at the latch withdraws immediately—he tucks a little flat pick back behind his clipboard as if it was always just a pen.

“Testing?” he repeats, smile tight. “No, sir. Old locks. Buildings swell in the fog.”

At your comment about the breathing, the silence below breaks: a small, deliberate cough from one landing down—polite, practiced, like a signal. A man you can’t fully see shifts position; you catch the corner of a grief-permit satchel and a pale hand on the rail. He doesn’t come up. He just *listens*.

Tollin clears his throat and, without asking, reaches two fingers toward the permit as if to “steady it for a look.” His nails are ink-stained, the kind you get handling registry books all day.

“Let me just confirm the seal impression,” he says. “Audit protocol. Quick as breath.”

Behind him, farther down the stairs, the checkpoint bell on the street gives a single clink—answered by a second clink, closer, like someone has stepped under it.

Tollin’s voice drops, still friendly: “If the stamp’s clean, this takes five seconds. If it isn’t… I have to log the address.”

The threat is plain: if he gets his fingers on the permit, he can tilt it into the light and catch the **UNREGISTERED**. If you deny him, he can mark you for a compliance visit—possibly with more than two people next time.

*Simulation triggers: watcher_Ward The Stairwell_0_f676bb*

#### Turn 14 **[PLAYER]**

I pull the permit back a hair and angle it so the stamp stays in shadow. “Seal impressions are verified against the ledger entry number—unless the Mourning Office rewrote its own protocol overnight.”  

I tap the paper with my knuckle, not letting him touch it. “What’s my file number, Tollin? Say it out loud. And while you’re at it—whose pick were you using on my latch?”

*Agent reasoning: Tollin’s trying to get the permit into the light; I need to keep control of the paper while probing who’s really behind this. I’ll distract with procedure, force him to talk, and use a tiny smear/crease to obscure the raised ink while I read his reaction.*

#### Turn 15 **[GAME]**

You pull the permit back and cant it into the door’s shadow. The raised edge of the stamp stops flashing. Tollin’s two fingers hang in the air a beat too long—then retreat to the clipboard.

His smile thins into something administrative.

“Ledger entry number,” he repeats, like he’s tasting whether it’s worth arguing. “That’s for *registered* grief permits.” His eyes flick, involuntary, to where your thumb is covering the lower-left of the stamp. “These new Audit-issued slips are… simplified.”

You tap the paper with your knuckle. The sound is sharp in the cramped stairwell.

“What’s my file number, Tollin? Say it out loud.”

Tollin looks down at his clipboard as if it’s going to rescue him. He wets his lips. “Lorne, Vesper. Freelance investigator. Prior liaison—” He stops. There is no number to read, and you can see him decide, in real time, not to say that part.

“And whose pick were you using on my latch?”

The “friend” below takes one step up—close enough that you can finally see him: broad-shouldered, coat too fine for this stairwell, Mourning satchel carried like a prop. Not a clerk. His eyes are flat and amused, and he’s wearing black gloves despite the indoor warmth.

He speaks, calm as a receipt: “Protocol’s flexible during an Emergency Decency Audit.”

Tollin’s throat bobs. He shifts his body half an inch to block your view into the stairwell as if *he’s* the door now. “Investigator, please. Don’t make this difficult. We can log you compliant and be gone.”

The gloved man’s hand drops to the satchel at his hip. Not reaching for a weapon—reaching for papers.

“A notice,” he says. “Impending classification. Unregistered grief.” He lets the words hang where your permit can hear them.

Threat, clear and immediate: if they log you *noncompliant* or *unregistered*, Mourning Office authority can legally seal your office and seize “indecent” materials—today, not later. And the man below is ready to serve it the moment Tollin stops pretending this is a routine check.

*Simulation triggers: watcher_Ward The Stairwell_0_f676bb*

#### Turn 16 **[PLAYER]**

I keep the chain on and smile like I’m bored enough to be dangerous. “Impending classification requires a named signatory. So—gloves: give me your name and division, and I’ll decide whether I’m laughing or complying.”

I raise the permit just enough to show the seal’s edge, never the whole stamp. “Tollin, you and I both know ‘simplified’ slips still have a routing mark. Read me the routing mark, and I’ll hold still while you ‘log’ me.”

Then I lean closer to the crack, voice low. “And if you’re here for something other than a permit check, say it plainly—because my office is warded for forced entry, and I’d hate for you to bleed on municipal stationery.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re fishing for an excuse to classify me and seize my office; I need to stall, learn who the gloved man is, and redirect them with something that sounds like internal Mourning Office procedure—while keeping the chain on and my contraband out of sight.*

#### Turn 17 **[GAME]**

The chain stays taut. Your smile doesn’t move your eyes.

For a moment Tollin looks relieved you’re arguing procedure instead of swinging the door wide—then your mention of wards makes his relief curdle into fear. He glances down the stairs the way clerks glance at supervisors.

The gloved man steps up into full view, one hand still on the rail, the other producing a folded document with a Mourning Office seal—real wax, fresh press. He holds it up so you can see the header through the crack:

**NOTICE OF IMPENDING CLASSIFICATION — UNREGISTERED GRIEF**

No signature line is visible from your angle, just the seal and a block of dense, weaponized language.

“Name,” you say. “Division.”

He gives you a small, tired look. “You don’t get my name. You get compliance.”

Then he does something concrete: he reaches past Tollin and hooks a thin strip of paper—an official logging tag—onto your doorchain. The tag is threaded with a black fiber that looks like hair. It doesn’t *bite* the chain, but it clings like it wants to.

Tollin, voice tight, reads from his clipboard anyway, trying to salvage the fiction. “Routing mark is… D-9, salt docket, Audit annex.”

It’s too fast, too smooth—memorized. And wrong in a way that’s hard to prove without the ledger.

Your permit’s stamp-edge catches light again. Tollin’s pupils tighten. He sees enough.

The gloved man continues, measured: “We’re here for a withdrawal statement. You sign that you’re stepping away from the vanished-couples inquiry. In exchange, we log you compliant and the Audit doesn’t seal your office tonight.”

He taps the notice with one gloved finger. *Tap.* “You don’t sign, we file you as unregistered grief. That authorizes a decency seizure. Wards or not, they’ll bring a Mourning keywright and a Bailiff to witness.”

Downstairs, the checkpoint bell clinks again—closer now—and you hear a third set of footsteps enter the stairwell, heavier, unhurried.

The threat is immediate and specific: they’re escalating from “permit check” to “serve notice + force withdrawal,” and reinforcements are arriving to make refusal expensive.

*Simulation triggers: watcher_Ward The Stairwell_0_f676bb*

#### Turn 18 **[PLAYER]**

I lean in and study the logging tag on my chain like it’s a bug. “That fiber—human or horse? Don’t tell me you’re tagging my threshold with sympathetic hair and calling it ‘protocol.’”  

Then I lift my voice toward the stairwell, crisp and public. “Third set of boots: if you’re a Bailiff, announce yourself for the record. I’m being served an unsigned notice by an unnamed division.”  

I keep the door on the chain and add, quieter to Tollin, “You’re in over your head. Slip me the signatory name and I can make this clean for you.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re trying to box me into signing or getting sealed; I want to stall, gather names/evidence, and probe that hair-thread tag for occult function while looking for an alternate exit.*

#### Turn 19 **[GAME]**

You get close enough to see the fiber for what it is: not horsehair—too fine, too dark, and it lies against the metal like it recognizes it. It’s been lacquered with something that dulls the shine of the chain where it touches, leaving a faint matte crescent on the link.

Tollin flinches when you say “sympathetic hair.” His eyes dart to the gloved man, then to the stairs, as if checking whether he’s allowed to react.

Your voice carries down the stairwell.

The heavier boots stop. A pause—long enough to be deliberate—then a voice answers from the dark below the half-landing, smooth and almost bored:

“Bailiff Kettle. Shadow Court mediation detail.”

As he speaks, the gaslamp on the landing gutter-flares—steady, then a sudden bright lick of light along the banister. In that flare you see it: a shadow shaped wrong, folded into the darkest wedge beneath the half-landing where banister meets wall. It’s not attached to any feet you can see. It lies on the steps like a patient blade, angled toward your threshold.

When the flame steadies, the shadow is still there—thicker than it should be, as if it’s soaking up light.

The gloved man doesn’t look back. He only tilts his head a fraction, satisfied Kettle announced himself.

Tollin swallows hard at your quiet warning. His hand tightens on the clipboard until the paper creases. He whispers, barely moving his lips: “I don’t have—” then stops, because the gloved man’s gaze snaps to him like a leash.

Kettle’s boots start again, slow, one step up, then another—never crossing fully into the gaslamp’s brightest strip. His body remains mostly out of sight around the corner, but his *shadow* inches forward on the stair treads, testing the edge of the light like it’s feeling for a gap.

Kettle speaks again, still from below, voice carrying: “For the record: you’re being offered a clean exit. Don’t make it theatrical, Lorne.”

Concrete threat: the tag on your chain is now a sympathetic anchor at your threshold, and Kettle’s unnatural shadow is probing toward the doorcrack—staying just shy of the lamp-bright line, like it’s waiting for someone to shift, dim the light, or open wider.

*Simulation triggers: watcher_Ward The Stairwell_0_f676bb, guard_Ward The Stairwell_0_0d98e5*

#### Turn 20 **[PLAYER]**

I hook my finger through the chain link just inside the crack and scrape my thumbnail hard against the lacquered fiber, trying to peel or snap it without jostling the lamp-light. “Tagging my threshold with hair is theatrical, Bailiff.”

Without looking away from the tag, I call out, “Kettle—Shadow Court mediation still requires a named petitioner. Who filed for this ‘clean exit’?” Then, to Tollin in a near-whisper, “If you can’t give me a signatory, give me a *departmental cipher*—one letter. I’ll do the rest.”

*Agent reasoning: The sympathetic tag is an immediate foothold; Kettle’s shadow suggests a light-bound incursion. I want to test the tag without opening the door, keep everything on-record to pressure them, and try to turn Tollin into a leak.*

#### Turn 21 **[GAME]**

Your thumbnail bites into the lacquered fiber.

It doesn’t peel like glue. It *shears*—a dry, gritty snap—leaving a short bristle still threaded through the tag’s hole. The moment it breaks, the matte crescent on the chain link deepens, as if the metal just remembered being cold. The remaining bristle twitches once, like a cut nerve, then lies still.

The logging tag itself loosens and slides half an inch down the chain, no longer “hugging” the link. You’ve damaged whatever sympathetic purchase it had, but you haven’t removed the tag entirely; part of the anchor is still present.

From below, Kettle’s voice comes up the stairwell, amused in that professional way that never reaches kindness. “Petitioner prefers not to be named.”

His shadow advances two treads at once—too fast for the pace of his boots. It lengthens toward the doorcrack, thinning as it goes, like ink pulled under a knife. It stops just short of the bright strip cast by the landing lamp, pressing against the light-line as if it’s testing how firm reality is today.

The gloved man finally answers your “theatrical” remark by pulling a pen from inside his sleeve. Not a fountain pen—something with a blunt nib meant for carbon forms. He taps it against the notice. *Tap tap.* “Sign, and the tag comes off. Refuse, and we start logging what’s inside your office as ‘indecent materials.’”

Tollin’s eyes flick to your hand on the chain, then to the damaged bristle, and you see him decide to save himself.

He whispers, fast and ragged: “Cipher—” He hesitates as the gloved man’s gaze pins him. Tollin forces it out anyway, barely audible: “**L**.”

The gloved man’s jaw tightens. His free hand closes around Tollin’s clipboard hard enough the board creaks.

Kettle’s boots stop again. His shadow stays pressed to the edge of the lamp-light, poised—waiting for the smallest change: the door opening wider, the lamp guttering, or you stepping back from the threshold.

#### Turn 22 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my finger hooked in the chain and, very carefully, slide the loosened tag down toward the inside latch, trying to strip it off the chain without widening the crack. “Cipher L. Good—now we’re speaking an actual language.”

I raise my voice slightly, calm. “Bailiff Kettle, for the record: I’m refusing to sign an unnamed petitioner’s withdrawal statement under threat of decency seizure. If you want ‘mediation,’ state what matter is being mediated.”

Then I look straight at Tollin through the gap. “Walk away, Tollin. You’ve done enough. If they punish you for one letter, I’ll make sure your supervisor’s supervisor hears about the pick on my latch.”

*Agent reasoning: I got a cipher—“L”—so I should pocket that and stall. The shadow is probing the light-line; I need to keep the lamp steady and remove the remaining bristle/tag without widening the door. Also, Tollin just stuck his neck out; I can use that to sow discord and maybe get a name.*

#### Turn 23 **[GAME]**

You slide the tag down the chain toward the inside latch, millimeter by millimeter. It catches once on a burr in the link—then clears. The paper scrapes softly, a bureaucrat’s whisper.

At the latch, the tag snags again: the remaining bristle is still threaded through its hole, and the hole is too small to pass over the latch’s thicker metal. You can’t fully strip it without either tearing the tag or opening the door wider. You do manage to pull the tag flush against the inside hardware, tucking it out of the crack’s line—reducing whatever line-of-sight the stairwell has on it.

The gloved man sees the movement anyway. His pen stops tapping.

Kettle answers your raised voice from below, tone flattening into official recitation. “Mediation matter: breach of civic decency by continued pursuit of sealed romantic-ritual deaths. Petitioner alleges harassment of protected mourners.”

As he says *protected mourners*, his shadow does something new: it spreads sideways along the edge of the lamp-light, like liquid trying to find a seam. It doesn’t cross the bright line—but it begins to *map* it, tracing the boundary as if learning where it will be weakest if the flame gutters.

Tollin’s face goes pale at “protected mourners.” That phrase has teeth in the Mourning Office; it means someone important is in the ledger.

You tell him to walk away.

He tries.

Tollin shifts his weight back, turning his shoulder—then the gloved man’s hand clamps the top of Tollin’s clipboard and yanks him forward half a step, using him like a hooked coat. Tollin makes a small, involuntary sound, and the papers on the board flutter.

“Registrar’s assistant,” the gloved man says quietly, “you’re staying until this is logged.”

Then, to you, still controlled: “For the record, refusal noted. Next step is service and entry with witness.”

He reaches into his coat and produces a thin brass token stamped with the Mourning Office’s crescent—an entry warrant marker. He doesn’t present it through the crack; he just lets you see it.

Downstairs, Kettle finally comes into partial view: a shoulder, a gloved hand on the banister, and a strip of face in gaslight. He doesn’t climb into the brightest patch. He angles his chin toward your door.

Concrete threat, now immediate: they are moving from “pressure” to “forced entry with a keywright and Bailiff witness.” Kettle’s shadow is actively testing the light boundary, and Tollin has been physically restrained—meaning they’re willing to escalate and create leverage if you don’t comply.

I tear the logging tag in half at the latch—slow, controlled—so the bristled hole stays on the *outside* half and the rest stays with me, then I press my thumb to the chain-link’s matte crescent and murmur a quick unbinding charm under my breath.  

Out loud, level: “Show the brass token through the crack, close enough for me to read the strike-marks. Otherwise it’s theater, not service.”  

I raise my voice toward the stairs. “Bailiff Kettle, if you authorize entry on an unsigned notice with an unnamed petitioner, I’ll file a Shadow Court complaint naming you personally—and I’ll subpoena the keywright’s book. Last chance: tell me which ‘protected mourner’ I supposedly harassed. Initials are fine.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to force entry; I need to stall while extracting info and maybe sever the sympathetic tag. “Protected mourners” suggests a high-status petitioner—cipher L might be enough to narrow it. I’ll demand proper service through the crack, threaten liability, and quietly prep a warded countermeasure using the lamp-light boundary while I tear the tag to remove the bristle anchor.*

*Agent reasoning: The tag is still anchoring something at my threshold and Kettle’s shadow is testing the light; I need to break the sympathetic link, verify the warrant token, and force them to commit to a name/initials on record before they can twist the narrative.*

#### Turn 29 **[GAME]**

The paper gives with a dry, fibrous sigh. You tear slow, controlled—right at the latch where the tag’s hole won’t pass. The outside half keeps the bristled hole and the little official serial; the inside half stays in your fingers, a useless strip of bureaucracy with just enough ink to be incriminating if someone wants it to be.

Your thumb presses the chain-link’s matte crescent. You murmur the unbinding.

The charm *takes*—but not cleanly.

The chain doesn’t fall. Instead, the metal goes briefly cold, as if it’s remembering a different shape. The crescent mark under your thumb pales a shade, like chalk rubbed thin. The latch gives a tiny, involuntary click—half a release—then holds, as though something on the other side is keeping tension on it.

Outside, the gloved man hears that click. His head tilts a fraction.

You speak, level: token through the crack.

He doesn’t comply. He steps closer, and you see the brass token again, but held back from the gap—displayed for intimidation, not inspection. “You don’t get to audit my marks,” he says. “You get to sign, or you get to be witnessed.”

Downstairs, Bailiff Kettle answers your raised voice without moving into the brightest patch. “Careful with threats, Lorne.”

Then he gives you what you asked for—crookedly, like a bone tossed to a dog. “Initials: **E. S.** That’s all you’re owed.”

The gloved man’s free hand tightens on Tollin’s clipboard. Tollin flinches, and you hear the board’s clip creak. The registrar’s assistant’s eyes flick to you—pleading, angry, trapped.

Kettle continues, voice carrying up the stairwell: “Unsigned notice becomes signed the moment you refuse under service. Keywright’s book won’t help you if the entry is lawful.”

Concrete threat: they’re not negotiating. Kettle is prepared to call a keywright and force the chain, and the gloved man is actively using Tollin as leverage. Your unbinding partially weakened the latch, but the tension from the hallway side is preventing it from releasing fully—meaning if they apply force with tools, your chain will likely give faster than it would have before.

#### Turn 30 **[PLAYER]**

I slide the torn inside-half of the tag into my sleeve and step away from the crack, keeping my voice even. “Fine—witness it. But you’ll do it clean.”

I call down the stairs to Kettle. “E.S. noted. Before you bring a keywright, answer one thing for the record: is E.S. a mourner under *Court seal* or *Office seal*? Yes or no.”

Then, quieter, I move back into my office and start sweeping anything obviously occult off my desk into the bottom drawer—fast but careful—while murmuring a small steadiness-ward at the doorframe to keep the lamp-light from guttering.

*Agent reasoning: They’re stonewalling on the token and readying forced entry; I need leverage and information. E.S. is a lead, and Tollin’s a hostage—so I’ll buy time, hide anything sensitive, and try to flip the gloved man by forcing a procedural misstep while I prep a ward.*

#### Turn 31 **[GAME]**

The torn inside-half of the tag disappears up your sleeve with a soft rasp of paper on wool. You step back from the door. The crack goes dark as your shadow leaves it.

“Fine—witness it. But you’ll do it clean.”

A pause downstairs—just long enough to hear Tollin’s breathing hitch.

You call down: Court seal or Office seal?

Bailiff Kettle answers immediately, and too smoothly. “Neither. Protective custody. Shadow Court discretion.” He doesn’t say *yes* or *no*. He says it like a loophole he’s used before.

The gloved man at your door gives a small, satisfied exhale and raps the notice against the jamb—tap, tap—like punctuation. “You heard him.”

Then Kettle adds, louder, to make sure you hear the next part: “Keywright’s already on the way. You want clean? Don’t make him work.”

Inside, you turn from the door and start clearing your desk. The obvious pieces—salt-chalk, a thumbed folio of sigil tracings, the stoppered vial that always looks like it’s sweating—go into the bottom drawer. You’re fast, but careful: no clinks, no spills. The drawer slides shut with a controlled thud.

You murmur the steadiness-ward at the doorframe. The lamp-light stops its nervous fluttering and holds steady—warmer, less prone to gutter.

But the ward also *shows you something*: a thin, hairlike shadow line draped across the top corner of the frame, not part of the woodgrain. A listening filament—fine work, the kind that turns vibrations in a door into a faint readable whisper.

Outside, the gloved man shifts his weight, and the filament quivers in sympathy. They’re already taking notes on your tone, your cadence—anything that can be rewritten later as “admission” or “threat.”

From the stairwell below comes the scrape of boots and a new sound: metal tools clinking in a roll. Someone is indeed coming up—keywright or Bailiff aide—close enough now that you can place each step on the stairs.

Threat, clear and immediate: forced entry is minutes away, and your ward has confirmed the doorframe is being used to listen in on you right now.

#### Turn 32 **[PLAYER]**

I lean close to the door and say clearly, for the filament, “Understood—protective custody, Shadow Court discretion. I’ll cooperate and I won’t destroy evidence.”

Then I step back, take my salt-chalk from the drawer just long enough to draw a tiny closed loop over the top corner of the frame—right where the hairline shadow sits—murmuring, “No ear, no tongue,” and snap my fingers to deaden the filament.

While they’re coming up, I grab my coat and my travel case, and I check the back window latch—quietly—looking for an alternate way out or a place to stash the occult pieces if they breach.

*Agent reasoning: There’s a listening filament on the frame and forced entry is imminent; I want to both mislead their recording and quietly disable the filament while preparing an exit/contingency.*

#### Turn 33 **[GAME]**

You speak into the door like it’s a court stenographer. The filament at the frame’s corner trembles—*taking it*—and somewhere beyond the wood, a faint scratch of pencil stops, then resumes faster.

You step back, pull the salt-chalk, and draw a tight closed loop right over the hairline shadow. “No ear, no tongue.”

When you snap your fingers, the filament doesn’t just go slack—it *burns out* in a thin, silent curl, like a hair singed off a candle. A peppery, scorched-ink smell blooms for a second and then dies.

Immediate consequence: the listening line is dead. But it dies loudly in the only way covert things can—by leaving a tell.

Outside, the gloved man’s posture changes. He leans in toward the jamb as if he felt a draft, then raps once—hard—on the wood. “Cute,” he says, voice sharpened. “Add obstruction to the note.”

Below, Bailiff Kettle calls up, “Keywright—move.”

Boots accelerate. The tool-clink comes closer, now distinct: picks, a tension bar, something heavier that could be a small pry.

You grab your coat and travel case and cross to the back window. The latch is shut, but it isn’t *latched right*: the hook sits a hair off its seat, and there’s a faint smear of violet-amber residue on the sill—perfume-ink, the same family as your invitation’s binding scent. Someone has had this window open recently and wiped it down badly.

You ease it up a fraction. Cold salt air pushes in. Outside is the narrow service gap between buildings: a drop to the alley, a drainpipe with two rust-bloomed brackets, and—new—an iron clothesline stretched to the opposite wall with a fresh knot. Not yours.

As you look, a shape shifts in the fog below: a person standing still at the alley mouth, hat brim low, watching the back of your building rather than the front. They don’t call out. They don’t leave. They’re positioned like they’re waiting for you to choose the window.

At the front door, metal touches metal: the keywright has started working the chain. The latch you half-loosened earlier gives a small, betraying click in response.

Threats are now twofold and concrete: forced entry is underway at the front, and a watcher is posted to catch or follow you if you exit via the back.

#### Turn 34 **[PLAYER]**

I dab a fingertip on the violet-amber smear and sniff it, then rub it onto a scrap of paper like a quick field-sample and tuck it into my case.  

I crack the back window a little wider and, staying low, whisper into the fog, “You down there—are you Kettle’s, the keywright’s, or mine?”  

Then I toss my coat out first—just the coat, bundled to look like a body—aiming to snag it on the drainpipe/brackets and make the watcher flinch, while I stay inside and listen for their reaction.

*Agent reasoning: I’m boxed in—front breach imminent, back exit watched. I want to learn who’s waiting and why, but I also need leverage and a way to slip without being grabbed. A decoy plus a quick look at that perfume-ink residue could tell me whose hand is in this.*

#### Turn 35 **[GAME]**

The violet-amber smear comes up tacky on your fingertip. When you sniff it, it hits like expensive grief: violet first, then a warm resin note, then a faint ash bite that dries the back of your throat. It’s not just perfume—there’s binding ink in it, the kind meant to cling to skin oils.

You rub the residue onto a scrap of paper. The paper darkens in a slow bloom, like it’s drinking the scent. You fold it once and slide it into your travel case.

You crack the window wider and whisper into the fog, staying low: “You down there—are you Kettle’s, the keywright’s, or mine?”

The figure at the alley mouth doesn’t answer. Instead, they lift a hand—two fingers to their lips—then point upward, not at you exactly, but at the window line, as if marking your position for someone else. A second later, you hear a soft *clack*—a small mechanism being thumbed, like a pocket lantern shutter or a signaling mirror ring being adjusted.

You bundle your coat and toss it out.

It catches the drainpipe bracket for half a heartbeat, then slips, flops, and drops—hitting the alley stones with a wet-sounding thud that reads like meat in the fog.

The watcher reacts hard: boots scrape back, and you hear the quick inhale of surprise. They move fast toward the “body,” crouching.

Then—too controlled for a random tail—they stop short. “Coat,” they mutter, and you catch the faintest laugh under their breath, like they’re annoyed at themselves for flinching.

Immediately after, a second set of footsteps enters the service gap from the far end—lighter, quicker. Someone else is coming in, drawn by the signal. The first watcher straightens and angles their body to keep the alley mouth covered, not you—like they’re making room for the newcomer to take point.

At your front door, the chain gives a sharp *snap-click*—the weakened latch finally yields under the keywright’s pressure. The door doesn’t swing yet, but it’s no longer secured by the chain; only whatever lock you have beyond it is holding.

Concrete threats now: you’ve confirmed the back watcher is coordinated (they just signaled and got a response), reinforcements are arriving in the service gap, and the front chain is defeated—entry is imminent.

I pull the window down to a narrow crack again and whisper, “All right—message received,” then I quietly slide the travel case under the floorboard gap by my desk and kick the rug back over it.  

At the front door, I call out, “Before you step in—Bailiff Kettle, confirm you have a writ signed by a seated Shadow Court magistrate, not ‘discretion.’ Name the magistrate.”  

While they answer (or don’t), I take my salt-chalk and draw a quick, ugly ward-sigil on the inside of the front threshold—nothing flashy, just enough to sting the first boot that crosses and buy me a heartbeat—then I go back to the rear window and watch the newcomer’s feet in the fog for a telltale uniform or token.

#### Turn 41 **[GAME]**

The back window drops to a slit. Fog presses against it like damp felt.

You pry up the loose board by your desk and feed the travel case into the gap. It fits, barely—wood rasps leather, and the case thumps once against whatever’s beneath the floor. Rug back over, scuffed into place.

At the front door, your voice carries.

A pause. Then a man answers close to the wood, amused and careful. “You’ve got the wrong name, Lorne. Kettle doesn’t climb stairs.”

Paper slides under the door—thick, official stock. Not a writ. A notice form, half-folded so you can see the header: **SHADOW COURT BAILIFF SERVICE — INTENT TO CLASSIFY: UNREGISTERED GRIEF**. No magistrate seal visible from this angle; just a blank line where one should be, and a red wax thumbprint that isn’t impressed with a signet—just pressed on, messy.

“I’m here,” the voice continues, “to give you one last chance to make yourself tidy. You withdraw from the vanished-couples inquiry, you sign, you stay registered. You don’t—” a soft tap on the door, right where your chain used to be “—and the city’s allowed to treat you like a loose death.”

While he talks, you crouch and scratch the salt-chalk sigil on the inside threshold. The chalk bites the varnish; the lines go down quick and ugly. The air around it goes faintly metallic, like you’ve just licked a coin.

Back at the rear window, you watch the alley.

The first watcher’s boots are still by your discarded coat. The newcomer arrives into view: narrow shoes, polished toes, no municipal hobnails. Their hem is dark and tailored, the kind that doesn’t brush tenement filth unless it has to. When they step, a small glint swings at knee-height—an enamel token on a short chain, catching lamp-light: a lacquered lantern emblem, black on gold.

They stop beside the first watcher. You hear a low exchange, half-swallowed by fog.

“Is it him?” the newcomer asks.

“Up there. Window line,” the first replies.

At the front door, something scrapes—metal on metal—followed by the quiet click of a tool finding the lock. They’re not waiting for your answer anymore. If that door opens and a boot crosses your threshold, your sting-ward will fire—once.

#### Turn 42 **[PLAYER]**

I snatch the “Intent to Classify” paper, scan for any watermark or hidden ink with a quick breath-warm and tilt to the lamp, then spit, “No seal, no magistrate—tell your boss I don’t sign blank deaths.”

I brace just off the threshold with my chalk in hand, waiting for the first boot—when the sting-ward bites, I use that heartbeat to dart away from the door and slip out the back window, landing light by the drainpipe.

Outside, I keep low in the fog and follow the lantern-token newcomer at a distance, watching their hands and listening for who they report to.

*Agent reasoning: They’re not legit—no seal, wrong bailiff—and the back alley has a lantern-token operative coordinating. I want to learn who’s pulling strings, but I need to survive the breach; the sting-ward buys one beat, so I’ll use it to slip out the back and tail the lantern token rather than get boxed in.*

#### Turn 43 **[GAME]**

You snatch the paper and put it to the lamp. The stock is good—too good for a street bailiff. When you breathe warm across it, a faint watermark blooms: a mourning-lily filigree… but it’s wrong in the way a forged coin is wrong. The lily’s veins resolve into tiny linked pairs—names in microprint, twinned and repeating. The hidden ink isn’t a signature; it’s a ledger-thread.

You tilt it. No magistrate seal. No impressed signet anywhere. Just that smeared red thumbprint and a clerkish serial number that’s been scratched over once and re-inked.

“No seal, no magistrate—” you spit. “—tell your boss I don’t sign blank deaths.”

On the other side of the door, the amused voice drops its warmth. “Pity.”

Metal whispers. The lock gives.

The door cracks open and a boot starts over your threshold.

Your sting-ward bites like a trapped wasp: a sharp *snap* of air and a flash of salt-white sting that crawls up the intruder’s shin. The man jerks back with a choked curse—pain, not incapacitation—stumbling into the hall rail hard enough to rattle it.

But the heartbeat you bought is real.

You’re already moving. You slip to the rear, shoulder through the narrow window gap, and drop to the alley by the drainpipe. Your landing is light—boots kiss wet stone, no slip—though your palm scrapes on the pipe’s rust seam.

In the fog, the lacquer-token newcomer turns at the sound from upstairs. Their head tips, listening. They don’t run; they *signal*—two fingers lifted, a small circular motion.

From the street mouth of the alley, a reply comes: the muted clop of approaching steps, multiple, measured.

The newcomer murmurs to the watcher you saw earlier, close enough for you to catch: “He’s out. Don’t grab—guide.”

They start walking, not away, but *along* the alley line that leads toward Gullhook Row’s main artery—hands visible at their sides, posture deliberately nonthreatening. The enamel token glints once, and when they pass a lamp, you see their other hand is ink-stained at the thumb and forefinger, as if they’ve been handling perfumed paper.

Behind you, above, the front door bangs wider. The man you warded calls down the stairwell, voice sharp now: “Rear! He went rear!”

You can follow the lantern-token at a distance—but the measured steps from the street are closing in to bracket the alley within seconds.

#### Turn 44 **[PLAYER]**

I press flat to the drainpipe in the deepest fog-shadow and let the newcomer and watcher pass, close enough to catch names; if I can, I whisper, “Guide me to who?” under my breath, testing whether either reacts.

Then I climb the drainpipe/brackets up a few feet and swing onto the nearest ledge/overhang—any ugly perch—so the alley sweep misses me, and I watch the street-mouth steps for uniforms, boots, and that lantern emblem.

*Agent reasoning: I’m about to get bracketed; better to misdirect and learn who these lantern-token people are. I’ll eavesdrop close, then slip vertical/sideways into a bolt-hole rather than sprint into the net.*

#### Turn 45 **[GAME]**

You flatten to the drainpipe where the fog pools thickest, cheek against cold iron. The newcomer and the first watcher come past close—close enough you catch the newcomer’s perfume: violet-amber ash, the same wrong-sweet rot as the satchel.

They’re not talking loud, but you get a name.

The watcher mutters, “Lorne slipped your hook, **Mira**.”

So: Mira. Lantern-adjacent, at least by token.

You let the words out—barely a breath: “Guide me to who?”

Mira stops dead.

Not a jump. Not surprise. A clean stop like a dancer hitting a mark. Her head turns slightly toward your drainpipe shadow. She doesn’t look right at you—she looks *past* you, as if checking the air.

Her hand rises, fingers pinched, and she touches the enamel lantern token. It gives a tiny click, like a clasp.

“Wind,” she says softly to the watcher. “He’s here.”

The watcher’s hand goes under his coat.

You don’t wait. You climb—boots finding the drainpipe brackets, hands biting rust. A bracket groans once under your weight; rust flakes into your sleeve. You swing onto a narrow overhang—an ugly little rain-lip above a boarded window. Your knee knocks wood; the board thuds, but holds.

Below, Mira steps back into the alley and lifts her voice toward the street-mouth, controlled and clear: “Rear line. Up. He’s above the second boarded pane.”

So much for missing the sweep.

The steps from the street arrive: four figures, not municipal. No hobnails. Soft-soled shoes and long coats that don’t flap. Two of them wear black gloves; one has a short truncheon tucked like a tool, not a weapon. On the lead one’s lapel, a pin catches the lamplight—black-and-gold lantern enamel, same motif as Mira’s token, but smaller, more discreet.

They don’t rush you. They spread to box the alley: two at the street mouth, one halfway in, Mira nearest your building line. The watcher you first saw keeps his hand under his coat and watches your perch.

Mira tilts her chin up. “Vesper. Don’t make us bleed in public. Come down and be *guided*.”

You are perched above them, exposed if they decide to climb or throw something. They have you located, and they’re coordinating rather than panicking.

I keep my balance on the rain-lip and call down, “Mira—Lantern token, violet-ash paper, and an ‘Intent to Classify’ with no seal. Who exactly are you guiding me to: a magistrate, or a clerk with a thumbprint?”

While I talk, I scrape my salt-chalk along the rusty bracket and the ledge edge, laying a thin slip-line and a little grit-glam—just enough to make the first climber’s hand or boot slide. “No one climbs. No one throws. You want me tidy? Tell me the name at the top of your chain.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m boxed in and they’ve got coordination; I need information and a way out. I’ll talk to stall, probe who “Lantern” serves, and prepare a small distraction/escape using the drainpipe and chalk.*

#### Turn 50 **[PLAYER]**

I steady myself on the rain-lip and call down, “Mira—lantern token, violet-ash paper, and an ‘Intent to Classify’ with no seal. Who exactly are you guiding me to: a magistrate, or a clerk with a thumbprint?”  

As I speak, I drag my salt-chalk along the bracket and ledge edge—thin slip-line, a touch of grit-glam. “No one climbs. No one throws. You want me tidy? Tell me the name at the top of your chain.”

*Agent reasoning: They’ve got me boxed and Mira clocked my position; I need information more than a clean escape, so I’ll interrogate while quietly prepping a deterrent against climbing.*

#### Turn 51 **[GAME]**

Salt-chalk whispers over rust. The line you lay looks like nothing—just a pale scum on iron—but the air around it catches, as if the fog itself is suddenly heavier right at the edge. The rain-lip becomes meaner than it looks.

Your voice carries.

Mira’s eyes flick up again, still not quite meeting yours. At “no seal,” her mouth tightens—annoyance, not confusion. She plants her feet wider, like she’s bracing for a shove that won’t come.

“Cute,” she calls back. “You think we’re Mourning? We buy *space* from Mourning.”

The gloved one with the discreet lantern pin shifts a half-step forward, hands open and visible. Not climbing. Not throwing. Yet.

Mira continues, crisp as a clerk reading a charge: “Top of my chain doesn’t take names from rooftops. But since you’re collecting them—**Magistrate Caul Vey**. Civic side. He likes his problems folded and handed back.”

One of the men at the street-mouth turns his head sharply at that, like Mira’s said more than she was meant to. He murmurs, low: “Mira—”

She cuts him off without looking away from you. “He asked. I answered.”

Then she lifts her token again and clicks it twice.

From somewhere above and behind you—on the same building line, higher than your rain-lip—there’s a soft scrape: shoe on wet slate. A second later, a thin cord drops into view, weighted with something small and dark. It swings once, then steadies, like whoever’s holding it has done this before.

Not a thrown weapon. A loop. A snare.

The cord lowers toward your perch, aiming to catch your wrist or hook around your ankle if you move wrong. The person holding it stays out of sight on the roofline, but their position is clear: they’re directly above your escape route back up.

Below, the halfway-in bailiff (the one without gloves) tests the wall with his palm—careful. His hand hits your chalked bracket and skates a fraction. He freezes, then pulls back and wipes his palm on his coat, eyes narrowing.

Mira’s voice flattens. “Vesper. Last clean offer. Come down on your own feet. Or you come down with rope-burn.”

No one climbs. No one throws. But you are now boxed: four in the alley, and one unseen above with a lowering snare.

#### Turn 52 **[PLAYER]**

I shift my weight so the snare has to choose between my wrist and empty air, and I flick my chalk up at the dangling cord—trying to dust it with a quick tack-sting sigil. “Magistrate Caul Vey… civic side doesn’t send alley lanterns unless they’re laundering the paperwork.”

I keep my eyes on the roofline and call down to Mira, voice tight. “Tell Vey I’ll come tidy when I see a real seal and a real charge—until then, you’re just a clerk with muscle. Who’s holding the rope? Give me their name, and I’ll consider your ‘clean offer.’”

*Agent reasoning: I’m curious about Caul Vey and why they’re using a snare instead of knives; I need to buy time and test the rope-handler while setting up an exit. A small mistake: I’ll talk too long, risking the snare getting closer.*

#### Turn 53 **[GAME]**

Your shift buys you a heartbeat: the loop dips where your wrist *was*, kisses empty air, then swings back—searching.

You snap your chalk upward. The dust catches the wet cord and sticks in a thin, pale rash. For a moment nothing—then the tack-sting sigil bites. The rope fibers tense like a muscle cramping. The loop jerks hard, not toward you but *up*, as if it’s trying to recoil away from your mark.

Whoever’s holding it doesn’t let go. They haul—fast.

The cord slices up over the rain-lip and goes taut with a sharp *thrum* that vibrates through the bracket you’ve chalked. Your slip-line does what you paid it to do: the sudden pull makes the cord skid against the gritty edge instead of gripping cleanly. You hear a muffled curse from above, close and breathy.

But the recoil has a cost. The cord’s weighted end whips back down once, uncontrolled, and clips your forearm—more sting than impact—leaving a wet burn where the chalk dust has mixed with saltwater.

Below, Mira’s posture changes. She doesn’t look up anymore; she looks at the men around her and makes a two-finger sign—tight, impatient.

The gloved one with the lantern pin steps forward and produces something flat from inside his coat: a folded document board, wax-smeared at one corner. He holds it up where you can see it, but not close enough to read. The wax isn’t a seal—just a smear, like someone pressed a stamp and pulled away halfway.

Mira calls up, “You want names? Fine. Rope’s **Harrow**.” A beat. “You want *real* seal? You get it from Vey in person. That’s the point.”

Above you, Harrow shifts position. You don’t see him, but you hear slate grit and a knee scrape—he’s moving laterally, trying to get a better angle that avoids your chalked edge.

And down in the alley, the ungloved bailiff stops testing the wall and instead reaches into his pocket. The metallic click that follows is unmistakable: a spring-knife being thumbed open.

Mira keeps her eyes on you. “Last time: down. Now. Before Harrow decides you’re easier to drag than to talk to.”

#### Turn 54 **[PLAYER]**

I hiss through my teeth at the burn, then call down, “Harrow. Good—now I know who to curse by name if you slip that loop again.”

I flick a pinch of salt-chalk dust up toward the roofline to fog Harrow’s angle, then edge along the rain-lip toward the nearest corner where I can drop to a lower awning instead of the alley floor. “Mira, hold your knife-dog. Have Lantern-pin step forward—alone—and *raise the board close enough for me to read the heading*. You get five seconds of stillness, or I start making this wall slick for everyone.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re escalating—rope above, knife below—so I need to buy time and change the geometry. I’m curious about Harrow and that fake seal, but I can’t get cornered on a rain-lip; I’ll force a parley by creating a distraction and moving to a better perch while demanding to read the document up close.*

#### Turn 55 **[GAME]**

The salt-chalk pinch goes up in a pale burst. It doesn’t “fog” so much as *sparkle* in the wet air—grit catching gaslight—and Harrow’s next adjustment hesitates. You hear him inhale, then cough once, sharp, like he caught chalk in his teeth.

But the wind off the sea takes most of it. Whatever angle you stole, it’s brief.

You edge along the rain-lip toward the corner. The brick there is darker, slick with runoff. Below that corner is what you were aiming for: a canvas awning over a shuttered fishmonger’s side door—low enough to drop to, high enough to keep you out of immediate knife range. The canvas is rain-sagged; the supporting struts look old.

Mira doesn’t shout. She just lifts her hand and *closes it*.

The knife-dog (ungloved) doesn’t rush the wall—he can’t—but he does step back and sets his feet, eyes tracking your corner like he’s measuring where you’ll land. Knife stays open at his side.

The lantern-pin man moves—alone, as ordered—two careful paces forward into the middle of the alley mouth. He raises the board higher and closer, angling it to catch lampglow.

You can make out the heading now, block letters:

**INTENT TO CLASSIFY — UNREGISTERED GRIEF (PROVISIONAL)**

Beneath it, smaller: **Filed under Magistrate Caul Vey’s authority**. There’s a space where a seal should be—only that half-smeared wax bruise you saw before.

Mira calls up, “Five seconds. Don’t waste them.”

Above, Harrow stops coughing. The rope comes back down—not as a loop this time, but straight, weighted end first, dropping toward the *awning* line rather than your wrist. He’s aiming to hook the canvas or its strut so he can yank it when you commit to the drop.

You’re at the corner now. One clean step and you can drop to the awning—but Harrow’s weight is about to turn that awning into a trapdoor if he catches it.

#### Turn 56 **[PLAYER]**

I snap, “Unregistered Grief—provisional? That’s not a charge, that’s a fishing license,” and I fling a thicker chalk-salt smear straight at the weighted end of Harrow’s rope, trying to make it bite-sticky and jerk in his hand.  

Then I pull back from the awning edge and crab-walk along the rain-lip the other way, eyes up, looking for a drainpipe or window latch to drop by instead. “Mira—what *exactly* is being classified as ‘grief’ here, and whose name is on the original complaint?”

*Agent reasoning: The heading is useful, but the awning drop is now a trap if Harrow hooks it. I want to keep exploring for leverage—use the “Unregistered Grief” angle, disable the rope, and find a safer descent while pressing Mira for details.*

#### Turn 58 **[PLAYER]**

I freeze on the rain-lip and scan both directions for a drainpipe, window latch, or any ledge that isn’t under Harrow’s rope. “Hold—nothing’s moved on my end. What do I see right now: where’s Harrow’s rope, where are Mira and the lantern-pin, and is there a safe drop point?”  

Then I call down anyway, voice hard: “Mira—answer it clean. What’s being ‘classified’ as grief, and whose name is on the original complaint?”

*Agent reasoning: I’ve got no new scene text, so I’ll push for clarification and keep Vesper cautious—reposition away from the awning trap while demanding the missing details that matter: complainant, alleged “grief,” and the legal authority.*

#### Turn 59 **[GAME]**

You hold still on the rain-lip. Water runs off the gutter edge in a steady thread, tapping the brick below like a metronome.

**What you see, right now:**

- **Harrow’s rope:** It’s no longer swinging for your wrist. The weighted end hangs about a body-length out from the wall, drifting slightly in the wind—then it lifts, controlled, as Harrow draws it back up. The line scrapes the roof edge once, a gritty hiss. You don’t see Harrow, but you can track his position by the rope’s angle: he’s moved a few feet to your left, trying to get above your new line.

- **Mira:** Still at the alley mouth, shoulders squared, one hand raised in that tight “hold” fist. She’s watching you like a ledger entry that might start bleeding.

- **Lantern-pin:** Two paces in front of her, board still up. He doesn’t advance further. His free hand stays visible and empty, fingers spread slightly to show compliance.

- **Safe drop points:**  
  - To your **right**, three windows down: a rusted **drainpipe** runs from the roofline to the street. The brackets look intact, but the pipe itself is salt-bloomed and dented—climbable, not trustworthy.  
  - Below you **immediately**, the **awning** you’d clocked is still there—rain-sagged, and now clearly within Harrow’s rope reach if he wants it.  
  - To your **left**, there’s a narrow **stone cornice/ledge** about a foot below the rain-lip that runs to a boarded window. It’s slick, but it’s not under the rope’s current hang.

You call down your question.

Mira answers—clean, but not kind. “**Grief is being classified as unregistered practice**. Meaning: you’ve been *handling* it without a permit that exists in the book.”

She nods at the board. “**Original complaint** was filed as ‘concern for public decency’—and the name on it is **Caul Vey**. Not a citizen. Not a victim. The Magistrate.”

As she speaks, the rope goes taut for a second—Harrow testing distance. The weighted end rises, then steadies, like he’s ready to drop it again the moment you commit to any descent point.

#### Turn 60 **[PLAYER]**

I mutter, “A magistrate filing his own decency complaint—how quaint,” then ease down onto the slick stone cornice to my left and start sidling toward the boarded window, keeping my shoulders tight to the wall and my eyes on the rope’s angle.

I call down, “Mira—if Vey’s the complainant, this isn’t enforcement, it’s acquisition. Tell me what he thinks I’m *holding*—name the grief, or I walk away and you explain the missing seal to him.”

*Agent reasoning: Vey filing his own complaint smells like a setup; I want more info, but I also need a descent point Harrow can’t easily foul. The left cornice gives me lateral movement and a chance to reach that boarded window hardware.*

#### Turn 61 **[GAME]**

Your boots find the cornice with a wet, careful kiss. Stone—slick as fish skin. You get your weight over it, shoulders pressed to brick, and start to sidle left.

The rope answers immediately.

The weighted end drops—fast—aimed not at your hands, but at the **space just ahead of your feet**, a pendulum meant to make you flinch off the ledge. It clips the wall with a dull *thunk*, showering grit and a few flakes of mortar. Not a hit, but close enough to tell you Harrow’s recalculated.

Mira’s fist loosens. She tips her chin up, eyes narrowed, and you can see her making a decision about how much truth costs.

“Acquisition,” she repeats, like she’s tasting the word. Then, louder so Harrow and the lantern-pin hear it too: “He thinks you’re holding **a romance ledger entry that isn’t his**.”

The lantern-pin man shifts—just a half-step—board still raised. His voice finally shows through, thin and bureaucratic. “Investigative materials recovered from sealed sites constitute—”

Mira cuts him off with a look, then keeps talking to you. “Not a name. A *pairing*. Two missing couples’ registry-lines that were supposed to be ash by now. That’s what he thinks you’ve got, Vesper. That’s why the seal’s wrong—this notice wasn’t meant to be filed. It was meant to be *effective*.”

Above, the rope snaps tight again, not dropped this time—**hauled**. The weighted end skitters along the roof edge and disappears upward. Harrow’s repositioning for something else.

You reach the boarded window. The boards are old pine, nailed in a hurry long ago. One nail head is bright—newer. Whoever boarded it last time did it *recently*, and didn’t bother matching the hardware.

From the alley, the knife-dog (ungloved) stops measuring and moves: he backs toward the wall under you, eyes up, knife still down but ready. He’s getting into a spot where, if you drop, you drop near him.

Mira calls up, quieter now, a warning disguised as an instruction: “Don’t ‘walk away.’ Vey doesn’t let go. He *relabels*.”

And somewhere above-left, you hear it: a soft scrape of boot on gravel—Harrow is now **directly over the boarded window line**, rope unseen for the moment, which is worse than seeing it.

*Simulation triggers: watcher_Ward The Stairwell_0_f676bb, guard_Ward The Stairwell_0_0d98e5, secret_Ward The Stairwell_0_c9317b, secret_Ward The Stairwell_1_7221f9, watcher_Ward The Stairwell_1_ab6ab0*

#### Turn 62 **[PLAYER]**

I press flat to the brick, then slide my chalk blade out and start worrying at the *new* nail head—quiet, testing if the board will give without a full pry.  

I call down, keeping my voice even, “A pairing, huh? Mira—tell Vey he’s welcome to buy my ‘grief’ like anyone else: with a real seal and real terms. Knife-dog—take two steps back unless you want to be my witness when you slip.”  

Then I glance up toward the roofline, “Harrow—if you’re above this window, say so. I don’t like surprises, and you don’t like what I do when I’m startled.”

*Agent reasoning: The boarded window looks like a potential escape route, and the newer nail suggests recent access. Harrow repositioning above it makes it dangerous, but it’s also my best lead—why board it now? I’ll probe the window while keeping Harrow talking and try to control the knife-dog’s position with misdirection.*

#### Turn 63 **[GAME]**

The chalk blade finds the newer nail head. You work it slow, shaving at the edge where fresh metal meets damp pine. It gives—barely—a millimeter of lift, enough to whisper that the nail wasn’t driven deep. Whoever sealed this didn’t expect anyone to come back from the outside.

Below, Mira doesn’t look away from you. “Terms,” she repeats, and there’s a sharp, tired humor in it. “Vey doesn’t buy. He inventories.”

The lantern-pin man—knife-dog’s partner, really—keeps his board up and says, “This is an active decency action. Negotiation is—”

Knife-dog actually does what you say: he takes **one** step back, not two, eyes still on your boots. He’s staying just out of an easy drop-kick range while keeping you boxed between wall and fall.

From above, Harrow answers you—not with words, but with a **sound**: rope sliding over stone, controlled, measured. Then his voice, close to the roof edge, calm as stamped paper. “I’m above the window.”

A heartbeat later, the rope’s weighted end drops into view—**not** swinging at your feet this time. It drops straight down beside your shoulder and hangs there, almost gentle, like an offered hand.

Then it tightens.

The line jerks sideways, trying to **snare your forearm and pin it to the wall**—a restraint move, meant to trap the arm holding the blade and stop you from prying. The weight bumps your elbow hard; your chalk blade skitters, still in your grip but jarred.

At the same moment, the boarded window shifts: your earlier lift on the nail makes the board **creak and flex**, and a thin seam opens between board and frame—just enough for a **breath of air** to leak out.

It doesn’t smell like dust.

It smells like **violet-amber ash**—the same perfumed binding-ink note that’s been stalking your paperwork—stronger, fresher, like someone used it in there recently.

Mira’s head snaps toward the window seam. For the first time, her composure breaks a notch. “Vesper—don’t breathe that in.”

Knife-dog hears it too. He looks up at the seam, then at Mira, and his knife hand rises an inch—uncertain whether his orders are “contain” or “retrieve.”

Right now the threat is immediate and physical: Harrow’s rope is actively trying to bind your arm against the wall, and the window is venting binding-scented air through the gap you’ve opened.

#### Turn 64 **[PLAYER]**

I clamp my sleeve over my mouth and nose and twist my trapped forearm hard into the rope to take the bite out of it, grinding salt-chalk dust from my cuff into the fibers. “Mira—*what is that ink doing in there?*”  

Without looking down, I rasp, “Harrow, easy—if I go off this ledge you’re explaining a broken investigator to your magistrate,” and I kick my heel against the board near the loosened nail, trying to pop the seam wider for a quick look while I keep my face turned away from the vent.

*Agent reasoning: I’m curious about what’s inside, but the binding-ink scent is an immediate hazard; I need to stop breathing it and get Harrow’s rope off my arm without losing my grip or footing. I’ll use salt-chalk as a quick counter and try to widen the seam just enough to peek, not inhale.*

I keep my sleeve clamped over my mouth and nose and grind my cuff’s salt-chalk into the rope, twisting my forearm to slack it. “Mira—what is that violet-amber ink doing in there?”

“Harrow, ease up—if I go off this ledge, you’re the one handing Vey a broken investigator.” I hook my heel under the loosened board edge and give it a sharp kick to widen the seam just enough for a fast sideways glance, keeping my face turned away from the vent.

*Agent reasoning: I need to avoid inhaling that binding-ink, free my arm from the rope before I lose balance, and get a peek inside the window without committing to a full breach.*

#### Turn 67 **[GAME]**

Your sleeve seals over your mouth and nose; the fabric goes damp fast in the fog. You twist your forearm into the rope and grind your cuff hard—salt-chalk rasping into the fibers.

It works, partially.

The rope doesn’t “burn” like a warded cord would; it’s just rope, but it’s been waxed. The chalk fouls the wax and the line **slips a fraction**. Enough slack to keep your forearm from being pinned flush to the brick—enough that you can move, but not enough to get free. The weight still knocks against your wrist like a metronome.

Above, Harrow’s voice comes again, strained by effort. “Don’t dramatize, Lorne.” But the line **eases** a hair—his pull becomes control rather than yank. He’s listening, if only because paperwork hates obvious injuries.

Mira answers your question without looking at the lantern-pin man. “That’s not ink in there. That’s *set.* Binding medium. You let it air and it looks for lungs and lies.”

You hook your heel under the loosened board edge and kick.

The board pops with a dry crack; the loosened nail **tears free** with a squeal. The seam opens to two fingers’ width, and a **visible ribbon of perfumed vapor** curls out—lazy, searching—before the fog tears it apart.

You keep your face turned away and take a fast sideways glance.

Inside is not your office.

It’s a narrow, lightless service cavity behind the wall—like someone built a false back. You see: a shallow shelf, a coil of dock-twine, and a **small ceramic inkwell** tipped on its side, its mouth smeared with violet-amber residue. Next to it, pressed into the wood as if stamped, is the **lovers’ sigil**—fresh, wet-looking despite the dark.

And something else: a **thin wire** stretched across the cavity at ankle height, tied to the board you just kicked. The board’s movement pulls it taut.

You feel it in your boot through the wood: a tiny *click*—not loud, but decisive.

Below, knife-dog’s uncertainty resolves into action. He lunges toward the wall, reaching up—not for you, but for the board gap, like he’s been told to secure whatever’s inside before you do.

Mira’s hand flashes out and catches his wrist. “No,” she snaps, and for the first time her voice carries command, not negotiation.

The threat is immediate and concrete: the wire you tripped has just actuated something **inside the false cavity**—and you don’t yet know if it’s an alarm, a trap, or a release valve for more of that binding vapor.

#### Turn 68 **[PLAYER]**

“Everyone hold—nobody touches that gap.”

I keep my sleeve over my face, then jab the chalk blade into the seam to pin the board back toward closed and kill the airflow; with my free fingers I feel for that thin wire and try to nick it clean. “Harrow—give me slack, now, or you’re the one tripping whatever I just woke up.”

*Agent reasoning: The click suggests a trap or release; I need to stop airflow and inspect quickly without inhaling, while also keeping Mira from losing control and preventing the knife-dog from grabbing evidence. I’ll try to jam the board back, cut the trip wire if I can, and get Harrow to slack the rope so I can work.*

#### Turn 69 **[GAME]**

“Nobody touches that gap,” you rasp through cloth.

Knife-dog freezes mid-reach like he’s been slapped by a rule he recognizes. The lantern-pin man doesn’t freeze—he takes a half-step sideways to get a better angle up at you, eyes narrowing, already calculating how to report this.

You jam the chalk blade into the seam and lever the board inward. The gap narrows; the perfumed ribbon of vapor thins to almost nothing. The smell doesn’t vanish, but it stops *pouring*.

Your free fingers find the wire—cold, thin, under tension. It’s not fishing line. It’s metal filament, the kind used in cheap trip-snares.

You start to nick it.

The moment the filament’s tension shifts, something inside the false cavity answers: a second, quieter *click*, followed by a soft, wet **glug**—like a stopper pulled from a bottle.

Even with the board mostly pinned shut, the cavity exhales again, harder this time. The vapor doesn’t just drift; it **pressurizes** and jets through the remaining hairline seam, trying to find the easiest path. It hits your sleeve and shoulder first, soaking the cloth with that violet-amber reek.

Mira’s eyes widen. “Vesper—stop cutting it. It’s a siphon.”

Above you, Harrow swears under his breath. The rope slackens noticeably—enough that your trapped forearm can bend without the weight hammering your wrist. “Slack,” he spits, as if the word tastes bad. “Don’t—move—fast.”

But the mechanism you woke up doesn’t care about Harrow.

Inside the cavity, you hear something skitter—ceramic scraping wood—then a brittle **crack** as the tipped inkwell shifts and breaks against the shelf edge. The binding medium starts to leak in earnest.

Below, knife-dog yanks his wrist back from Mira and backs off two steps, suddenly pale. “That’s Lantern stink,” he mutters, like it’s an accusation.

The threat is now clear and immediate: the trip-filament is tied to a **pressurized release** inside the false wall. Cutting it mid-tension has opened a siphon, and the cavity is actively venting binding vapor and leaking medium behind the board—meaning the longer it runs, the more it will saturate the wood, your sleeve, and the air around you.

#### Turn 70 **[PLAYER]**

I stop nicking the filament immediately and shove the board fully closed with the chalk blade as a wedge, then press my palm flat over the seam through my sleeve to seal it. “Mira—Lantern stink means what, exactly? And how do I choke a siphon without breathing it?”  

I glance up, tight-voiced, “Harrow—hold that slack and anchor me; if I have to drop, I’m dropping on purpose, not because your rope twitched.”

*Agent reasoning: The siphon is venting binding vapor; cutting the wire worsened it. I need to stop airflow fast, avoid inhalation, and learn what “Lantern” implies from Mira/knife-dog while I still have leverage over Harrow’s rope.*

#### Turn 71 **[GAME]**

You stop cutting. The filament keeps its tension, humming faintly under your fingertip.

You shove the board fully shut with the chalk blade and wedge it. Wood complains; the seam compresses to nearly nothing. When you press your palm flat over it through your sleeve, the airflow drops from a jet to a spiteful, intermittent hiss—like a kettle trying to breathe through a pinhole. The perfume still seeps, but slower, and it’s mostly trapped against your sleeve and the wall.

Consequence: your sleeve is now **saturated**. The cloth clings to your skin, damp and cold, and the violet-amber stink is strong enough you taste it through your teeth even without inhaling.

Mira keeps her face turned away, speaking fast. “Lantern stink means *pairing medium.* It doesn’t just bind skin-to-skin—” She swallows, eyes flicking to Harrow and then to the lantern-pin man. “—it binds *story.* It makes you decide you’ve always wanted what it wants.”

Knife-dog’s voice comes small now. “It gets in your head. Makes you—” he stops, jaw working, refusing to say the rest.

“How do I choke a siphon without breathing it?” you ask.

Mira answers with what she can, not what you want. “You don’t *choke* it from this side. You cap the source or you drown it. Water cuts the perfume—saltwater best. But if it’s pressurized, it’ll keep pushing until the reservoir’s empty or the line breaks somewhere else.”

Above, Harrow shifts his stance; you feel the rope go from “held” to **anchored**—he’s braced it around something solid up there, taking the twitch out of it. “You’ve got slack,” he calls down, voice clipped. “You drop, you call it. I’m not catching surprises.”

The lantern-pin man takes out a small paper slip and a stub of pencil, shielding it from fog with his body. He starts writing anyway, eyes never leaving your wedged board. “This is municipal property,” he says, calm as a coffin. “You’re sealing evidence.”

Mira snaps back, “You’re *watching* evidence vent into a tenement.”

The immediate threat is now twofold and concrete:
1) The siphon is still **actively pressurizing** against your seal; if the wedge shifts or your hand slips, it will vent a stronger burst directly into the stairwell air.
2) Your sleeve and palm are contaminated; if you lower your guard and breathe normally, you risk inhaling enough pairing medium to start **memory-skips and compulsions**—and the lantern-pin clerk is already preparing to turn this into a charge.

“Clerk—write this too: you were warned it’s venting into a tenement, and you chose ink over containment.”

“Mira, get me saltwater—bucket, bottle, anything—now. Knife-dog, run if you’ve got sense.” I keep my sleeve sealed to the seam, then slide my chalk blade’s edge to scratch a quick salt-sigil on the board face around the nail holes, trying to make the wood drink the medium instead of breathing it out.

Up to the roofline: “Harrow—haul me up a foot. I want to see if there’s another board or vent higher I can cap from above without opening this.”

*Agent reasoning: The siphon’s still pushing and my sleeve’s contaminated; I need saltwater fast and to keep the gap sealed while I learn where the reservoir is. Also the clerk writing is a problem—distract or enlist him as witness.*

#### Turn 74 **[PLAYER]**

I freeze with my sleeve still sealed to the seam, listening hard. “Mira—talk to me. Harrow—status on the line. Did something just go dark, or did I?”

*Agent reasoning: The scene went blank—either a UI glitch or a transition. I need clarification, but Vesper would treat it like a sudden blackout and try to stabilize the immediate hazard while demanding updates from the others.*

#### Turn 75 **[GAME]**

Your sleeve stays pressed to the seam. The hiss behind your palm thins to a faint, steady **tick-tick**—pressure bleeding through whatever hairline gap remains.

Nothing “goes dark” in your eyes. The gaslamp glow is still there, bruised and smeared by fog. What changes is sound: the stairwell’s usual drip and distant radio-prayer feel suddenly far away, as if someone shut a door between you and the building.

“Mira—talk to me.”

No answer.

You turn your head as much as you can without breaking the seal. Mira is still on the stairs below—but she’s gone rigid, chin slightly lifted like she’s listening for a name in a crowd. Her hand, the one that held the lantern hook, has loosened. The hook hangs from two fingers, swaying.

“Harrow—status on the line.”

Up above: rope creaks against brick. Harrow’s silhouette shifts. “Line’s good,” he calls down immediately. “You didn’t black out. You’re still with me.” Then, sharper: “Don’t breathe deep. Your sleeve’s soaked.”

Knife-dog isn’t running. He’s staring at Mira with an expression that’s half hunger, half panic—like he recognizes her as an answer to a question he never asked. He takes one involuntary step toward her.

The lantern-pin clerk has stopped writing. His pencil hovers. He’s looking at Mira too, and his mouth is slightly open, as if he’s about to speak a familiar pet name and can’t remember whose it belongs to.

You feel it in your own body—not a swoon, not a spell-circle snapping shut, but a **pull**: a thought trying to form around the idea that this moment has always been leading to a particular pairing. It’s not fully in you yet, but it’s at the edge, testing the seams.

Behind your palm, the siphon gives a single stronger **puff**, like it found a new path. The board shifts a hair against your chalk wedge—still closed, but the pressure is actively working it.

Threat, immediate and concrete: the medium is now affecting the people below you first. Mira is on the cusp of a compulsion state; knife-dog and the clerk are being drawn toward her. If anyone touches anyone else while this is in the air, the binding can “take” faster—and if your seal slips, the next vent will hit the whole stairwell.

#### Turn 76 **[PLAYER]**

“Eyes off her. Hands to yourselves—now.” I bark down the stairwell, voice tight through cloth. “Knife-dog, back down three steps and sit. Clerk, turn around and cover your mouth before you ‘remember’ something that’ll ruin your life.”

Without lifting my palm from the seam, I snap at Harrow, “Haul them up—Mira first, by the hook if you have to. Keep them separated. Nobody touches anybody.”

Then, softer but sharp, to Mira: “Mira—name five things you can see. Out loud. Stay with me.”

*Agent reasoning: The pairing medium is hitting Mira and the others; I need to stop contact immediately and get them out of the plume while keeping the seam sealed. I can use authority and threat, and ask Harrow to pull them up/out or at least keep distance.*

#### Turn 77 **[GAME]**

Your bark cracks through the stairwell like a slap.

Knife-dog flinches hard—like you yanked him by the collar. He stumbles backward three steps, overdoes it, and sits down on the edge of a stair with his hands clamped between his knees. His eyes keep trying to slide back to Mira anyway, but he forces them to the floorboards. “I’m— I’m sitting. I’m sitting,” he repeats, breath fast.

The clerk hesitates half a beat too long. Then whatever professional composure he had loses a tooth: he turns his back to Mira and the stairwell, shoulders hunched, and pulls his coat sleeve up over his mouth and nose. His pencil drops and clatters down two steps. “This is— this is highly irregular,” he muffles into wool, but he doesn’t turn back.

Harrow answers with action, not words. The rope jerks—tightens—then starts moving with measured pulls. You hear brick grit as it runs over the parapet above.

“Mira—name five things you can see.”

Mira blinks like she’s waking up underwater. Her lips part; no sound at first. Then, on the second try, she speaks—flat, forced, anchoring herself one object at a time.

“Rail. Rust… on the rail.” Swallow. “Your… sleeve. Chalk. The— the clerk’s pin. Knife-dog’s boots.”

The rope goes taut again. Harrow has hooked it down—using the lantern hook as an ugly improvised lift point. Mira’s fingers clamp reflexively around the hook as it pulls. It bites into her grip; she gasps, pain punching through the haze. Good: pain is reality. Bad: her body is now moving toward you, up the stairwell, through air that’s still contaminated.

“Nobody touches anybody,” Harrow calls down, voice strained with the haul. “I’ve got her. Keep your seal.”

As Mira rises, the siphon behind your palm gives another insistent **puff**. The board shudders against your wedge. Your chalk-sigil around the nail holes smears where your forearm brushes it—still there, but imperfect.

Concrete threat: Mira is being lifted through the affected air toward the roofline. If the board shifts further, the next vent will hit her full in the face on the way up; if she coughs or panics, she’ll inhale deeper. The clerk and knife-dog are contained for the moment, but both are still in the medium’s reach—one lapse, one touch, and the binding accelerates.

#### Turn 78 **[PLAYER]**

“Harrow—stop her just below me. Keep her there, breathing shallow into her sleeve; don’t let her drift past this seam.”

Keeping my palm sealed, I shrug my coat off one shoulder and flick it down between Mira and the wall like a curtain. “Mira—wrap your sleeve over nose and mouth. Two more: name your mother’s name and the last meal you ate.”

To the clerk, still turned: “You. Without turning around—do you have a canteen, flask, anything with liquid? Roll it up the stairs. Salt if you’ve got it.”

Then I press my ear to the board, voice low and surgical: “Listen, siphon—where’s your reservoir? Mira, when you’re steady, tell me: is pairing medium usually jarred, bladdered, or piped?”

*Agent reasoning: Mira’s passing right by the seam—if it vents again she’ll take it full force. I need a quick physical baffle without breaking the seal, and I want more info about the source/reservoir to end this instead of just holding it.*

#### Turn 79 **[GAME]**

Harrow checks the rope immediately. The line stops with a hard, controlled hitch; Mira hangs just below your level, boots scraping the brick as she tries to find purchase. “Holding,” Harrow grunts. “She’s not coming past you.”

You shrug your coat free and snap it down. It lands between Mira and the wall in a heavy fold—an improvised curtain that blocks line-of-sight and catches some of the draft. It doesn’t stop the air itself, but it breaks the “seeing” part of whatever’s trying to form.

“Mira—wrap your sleeve—”

She fumbles, then obeys. Sleeve over nose and mouth. Her breathing goes shallow, ragged but controlled.

“Mother’s name,” you prompt.

“E-Esme,” she says into cloth. “Esme Rook.”

“Last meal.”

“Pickled herring… and bread. Cold.” The answer comes quicker. Her eyes focus on your coat like it’s an instruction sheet.

The clerk, still facing away, pats his vest with one hand, then his coat. “I have water—work issue,” he says, voice pinched. He crouches, sets something metal on the step, and **rolls** it up the stairs without turning. It bumps twice, then comes to rest a step below Mira’s dangling boots: a dented, municipal canteen stamped with the Mourning Office seal. “No salt,” he adds. “Not on my person.”

You press your ear to the board.

Behind it, the siphon isn’t a voice—it's infrastructure. You hear a **wet, periodic draw**, like a bellows pulling through a narrow throat, then the faintest slosh answering it. The reservoir isn’t right behind the board; it’s *lower*, feeding upward. Each draw is followed by that thin pressure tick you felt earlier.

As you listen, the board shifts another fraction against your wedge. Not open—yet—but the seam **breathes**. A cold, perfumed exhale threads out and hits your cheekbone where your seal isn’t perfect.

Immediate consequence: your eyes sting and your throat tightens with the reflex to inhale deeper.

Mira, muffled, manages: “If it’s the… Lantern blend? It’s usually… bladdered. Pig bladder or gut-skin. Easy to hide under clothes, under seats. Piped is… municipal. Too loud. Too traceable.”

Harrow swears under his breath. “Vesper—your wedge is walking.”

Threat, clear and present: the feed is coming from below (a hidden bladder or line), and the seam is starting to leak around your ear/cheek. If the board gives any more, the next puff will vent directly into your face and down onto Mira’s position—she’ll take it full, and the clerk and knife-dog will catch the drift a heartbeat later.

#### Turn 80 **[PLAYER]**

I pinch my nose and mouth into my sleeve and turn my face away from the seam, blinking hard. “Harrow—hold. Mira, don’t breathe deep—eyes on my coat, not the wall.”

I hook my boot and drag the canteen up, then—without breaking my palm-seal—I crack it and splash water along the seam and into the nail holes over my chalk-sigil, trying to make a wet, swollen gasket. “Clerk—keep facing away. Knife-dog, stay seated.”

Then I rasp to Harrow, “I need a knife tip or something thin—can you lower me a blade or hook so I can probe under the board and find where it’s feeding from below without opening it?”

*Agent reasoning: The wedge is failing and the medium is already leaking into my face; I need to reduce pressure fast and create a proper wet seal using the canteen, while keeping Mira from inhaling and everyone separated. Curiosity pushes me to confirm the reservoir’s location, but survival comes first.*

#### Turn 81 **[GAME]**

You turn your face into your sleeve and blink the sting out. The perfume still finds you—thin, needling—but you’re not gulping it.

“Harrow—hold.”

The rope stays locked. Mira hangs where she is, feet braced against brick now, staring at the draped coat like it’s a lifeline. She nods once, small, and keeps her breaths shallow into her sleeve.

You snag the canteen with your boot and drag it up, metal scraping stone. With your free hand you work the cap. It resists—then gives with a sharp twist. Water slaps out in a sloppy sheet onto the seam and runs down into the nail holes, darkening the chalk-sigil to gray paste.

For a moment the board’s “breathing” changes: the **tick-tick** becomes a dampened **thup**, like the pressure has to push through wet fibers now. The seam swells slightly where the wood drinks.

Then the downside hits. The perfumed medium catches in the wet and starts to **foam** at the edge—tiny pearled bubbles that cling instead of dissipating. The smell intensifies, sweeter and more intimate, because it’s no longer just air; it’s a film.

Below, the clerk stays faced away, rigid. Knife-dog remains seated, but he begins rocking subtly, heel tapping the stair as if keeping time with a song only he can hear. He does not stand.

You rasp for a thin blade.

Harrow shifts above; rope creaks. “I’ve got a hook and a penknife,” he calls. “Penknife’s on my belt—can’t drop it clean without losing it. Hook I can lower.”

A second later, something metal scrapes at the parapet. The lantern hook descends on the line, swinging slightly. It’s not a knife tip—more like a blunt, curved beak. Usable for prying or snagging, not for delicate probing.

As it comes down, the wet seam gives a sudden **spit**—a single bead of black-violet fluid pushes out from one nail hole and slides down your watered chalk, leaving an inky comet trail.

Threat, immediate: your “gasket” is holding back open venting, but it’s concentrating the binding medium into a sticky film that can transfer by touch. If that hook (or your fingers) picks up the foamed residue and then contacts Mira, rope, or your own skin, you risk spreading the compulsion instead of containing it. Also, the feed is still pressurizing from below; the board is still trying to walk.

“Harrow—hold that hook steady in midair; do not let it touch the seam or the rope above my hands. Mira, stay braced and keep your eyes on the coat—no reaching.”

I fish a scrap of chalk from my pocket and, keeping my sealing palm planted, I flick a quick ring-mark on the stair just under the foaming drip line. “Clerk—still facing away: tell me if you smell anything sweetening. Knife-dog, count your breaths out loud—slow.”

Then I use the dangling hook like a long finger, reaching *under* the board from the bottom edge to snag or feel for anything taut—bladder, tube, twine—without prying the face open. “If I catch a line, Harrow, you yank up hard on my count; we sever the feed by ripping it free, not by opening the vent.”

*Agent reasoning: The seam’s turned into a transfer hazard; I need to stop pressure from below and avoid contaminating the hook/rope/Mira. I’ll use the hook at a distance to test for a feed line under the board, and I’ll try to “mark” the foam so we can see if it’s spreading while keeping everyone separated.*

#### Turn 83 **[GAME]**

Harrow steadies the hook midair like he’s holding a scalpel over a sleeping vein. “Steady,” he answers, voice tight. The hook stops swinging.

Mira keeps her eyes on the fallen coat and braces her boots harder into the brick. Her knuckles go white on the lantern hook she’s already gripping, but she doesn’t reach for anything else.

You scratch a quick ring-mark on the stair under the drip line—chalk biting damp stone. The foamed bead above it swells, hesitates, then drops. It lands inside your ring with a soft, wet *pat* and sits there, trembling like a living blister.

“Clerk,” you call.

Still facing away, he swallows audibly. “Yes. I—” He pauses, then his voice goes thin. “It’s… stronger. Sweeter. Like violets in a warm room.”

Knife-dog starts counting, obedient in a way that’s almost frightening. “One… two… three…” He forces the pace slow, but on “four” his voice catches, like he’s about to laugh or cry. He clamps it down and continues. His heel stops tapping—replaced by a rigid stillness.

You extend the dangling hook under the board from the bottom edge, careful not to pry. The metal tip disappears into the shadow gap beneath the plank.

At first: nothing but dust and cold brick.

Then the hook catches something that *gives* like skin. A taut, slick resistance—rounded, elastic. When you draw back a fraction, it pulls back against you, and the board answers with a sharp **thup** as pressure surges.

The foamed line at the seam reacts immediately: it **strings** outward in a thin filament toward the moving hook, as if attracted. A hair-fine strand stretches from the nail hole to the hook’s tip, trembling.

Concrete threat: the medium is trying to bridge onto the hook. If it makes contact, the hook becomes a contaminated transfer point—up the rope, into Harrow’s hands, and down into Mira’s grip.

Under the board, the thing you’ve snagged shifts—like a bladder rolling or being tugged from below. You feel a tied nub or knot through the hook’s pull.

You have a feed. You also have about a second before that filament touches the hook tip and turns your “long finger” into a wick.

“Harrow, haul the hook up fast—don’t let it touch anything. Mira, hands off the rope, keep your sleeve sealed. Clerk, don’t turn—back down five steps.”

*Agent reasoning: The filament is about to contaminate the hook/rope; I need to break the bridge and rip the feed in one decisive motion while keeping everyone from contact. Water made it sticky, so I’ll use it to wash the hook tip as a barrier and then yank on my count.*

#### Turn 89 **[GAME]**

Water slaps the hook tip and the hair-fine filament.

The effect is immediate—but not gentle. The violet-amber foam **collapses** into a heavier, glossy strand and **drops**, taking the tension out of the bridge before it can kiss the metal. It doesn’t dissolve; it turns syrupy and slides off in a slow ribbon, landing inside your chalk ring with a wet *plop*. The bead in the ring shudders, then goes still—like it’s holding its breath.

“NOW—”

On “THREE,” you wrench.

Under the board, the hooked thing **tears** with a sound like wet cloth ripping. The plank jumps up a finger’s width and slams back down. A burst of cold, briny air puffs out of the seam, carrying that violet sweetness—strong enough to sting the back of your throat.

The feed doesn’t come free cleanly. You drag up a short length of it: a slick, translucent **tube** the thickness of a quill, ending in a torn, pulsing **bladder-knot** that looks like a small fish’s swim sac—except it has a faint lovers’-sigil marbling through it like bruises.

As it clears the gap, the torn end **spits** a single glob of clear gel. It splashes across the stair two steps below your chalk ring and immediately starts **foaming** in a new line, creeping toward the nearest warmth—Harrow’s boots.

Harrow doesn’t argue. He hauls the hook up fast, arms locked straight so the metal stays away from rope and fingers. “Up—up—UP,” he mutters through clenched teeth, backing a half-step to keep it from brushing the wall.

Mira jerks her hands away from the rope as ordered, tucking her sleeve tight at the wrist with her teeth. She keeps staring at your coat, but her voice shakes: “It’s moving toward him.”

The clerk obeys, backing down five steps without turning. On the third step his foot skids on damp grit; he catches himself on the banister with a sharp inhale and then freezes, rigid, hands white on the rail. “I didn’t look,” he says too quickly, as if confessing.

Concrete danger: the fresh glob on the stair is **actively foaming and crawling** toward Harrow’s boots, and the torn bladder on your hook is still **pulsing**, leaking in small, timed spurts—each one a new starting point if it hits stone.

“Harrow—freeze. Do not step; lift your toes if you can without moving your soles.”

I yank my coat free from the wall with my sealing hand still planted, then fling the coat down between the crawling foam and Harrow’s boots like a deadfall blanket. “Mira, keep eyes down—tell me if it changes direction.”

To Harrow: “Get that hook over open air—over the street side if you can—let it drip away from stone. If it swings back toward the wall, drop it. I mean it.”

Then, voice low to the clerk without looking at him: “What’s the warmest thing down there—lantern, stove, body? Tell me where it’ll go if we give it a better meal than Harrow’s boots.”

*Agent reasoning: The feed is severed but now the gel is actively seeking warmth—Harrow’s boots are the immediate threat. I need a fast barrier/redirect and to get the contaminated hook/bladder isolated without spreading it.*

#### Turn 91 **[GAME]**

“Harrow—freeze.”

Harrow locks up like a statue. He manages to lift his toes a hair without shifting his heels; his boots creak against the grit but don’t slide. The crawling foam reaches the edge of your chalk ring and hesitates—then keeps coming, drawn to him in a thin, purposeful seam.

You yank your coat free. The moment your sealing hand breaks contact with the wall, the hairline shimmer you’d been holding back **flares**—a quick, pale pulse in the mortar like something exhaling. Nothing bursts through, but the wall-side air turns sharply colder.

You fling the coat down.

It lands between the foam and Harrow’s boots, heavy wool slapping wet stone. The foam hits the fabric and immediately **sinks in**, darkening the cloth in a spreading bruise. For half a second it looks contained.

Then the coat **twitches**—not from you, from the stuff inside it—like a muscle spasm. The soaked patch starts to **crawl across the coat’s weave**, seeking an edge.

“Mira,” you snap.

Mira keeps her eyes down on the stair and your coat hem. “It— it’s not going straight anymore,” she says fast. “It’s splitting. One line’s trying to go *around* the coat. The other is… going *through* it.”

Harrow, still holding the hook at arm’s length, shuffles his arms only—no feet—angling the hook outward toward the stairwell’s street-side opening. The torn bladder-knot on the hook **pulses** and spits a clear drip. The drip arcs… and catches the banister post, not open air.

The post blooms with a fresh bead of foam that immediately begins **creeping downward** along the wood grain like it knows the path.

Harrow goes rigid. “It touched the rail,” he says, voice flat with panic he’s strangling.

Your low question to the clerk gets an immediate answer—too quick, rehearsed by fear. “Lantern,” he whispers. “Bottom landing. Brass lantern on a hook. It’s been burning since morning because the Audit boys came through—said keep it lit. Warmest thing is that, then… bodies. There’s a porter asleep on a sack by the door.”

As he speaks, the foam on your coat reaches the coat’s outer edge and starts to **thread off** toward Harrow again, while the new strand on the banister begins its steady descent toward the lit landing.

The threat is now twofold: one line is still hunting Harrow’s boots at close range, and another is traveling down the banister toward the lantern—and any warm person near it.

“Harrow—drop the hook. Over street-side, now. Let it fall; we can mourn the metal later.”

I yank the canteen cap fully off and splash water down the banister post where it’s blooming, chasing the bead downhill with a wet smear. “Mira—kick that lantern off its hook at the bottom and shove it out into the open—make it the warmest thing *away* from the stairs. Wake the porter if you have to, but don’t touch him bare.”

Then, to the clerk: “Keep backing down—loud steps. Make noise. If it likes warmth, it’ll like panic and motion too; give it a trail that isn’t flesh.”

*Agent reasoning: Two active paths—one near Harrow, one heading for the lantern/porter. I want to redirect it to a controlled “meal” and break its route by making the banister cold/wet, even if it costs us the lantern. Also need Harrow to ditch the contaminated hook before it seeds more.*

#### Turn 93 **[GAME]**

Harrow doesn’t hesitate. He swings the hook out toward the street-side gap and **lets go**.

The hook drops out of sight with a brief metallic *whistle*—then a distant *clink* and a wet *slap* from somewhere below. A heartbeat later, a thin, violet-sweet **mist** puffs up from the street-side opening like breath from a drain. The torn bladder-knot is gone with it.

On the stairs, you rip the canteen cap off and throw water down the banister post.

The water hits the foaming bead and **doesn’t wash it away**—it **spreads it**. The bloom thins into a wider slick, and instead of one crawling seam you get **three**, each riding the wood grain downward like veins. The post darkens where it’s wet, and the foam uses that wetness as a faster road.

Mira is already moving. She keeps her eyes down, skirts the coat on the stair, and reaches the bottom landing. “Lantern—on the hook—” she says, then lifts a boot and **kicks**.

The brass lantern swings, hits the wall with a dull *gong*, then drops. The glass chimney doesn’t shatter—but the flame flares, and the lantern rolls, spilling a **bright oval of heat and light** across the threshold toward the open street.

The foam on the banister reacts instantly: its leading edge **accelerates**, angling toward the lantern’s new position, flowing down the last span of rail like it’s been given permission.

Mira, breathing hard, nudges the lantern again with her boot, shoving it farther out. “Porter!” she snaps—still careful not to look fully at him. A bundled shape by the door stirs and grunts.

The clerk backs down as ordered, making exaggerated, stomping steps. “I’m backing— I’m backing,” he says too loudly. His noise doesn’t lure it; the foam doesn’t even hesitate for him. It wants the lantern.

Up near you, the line that soaked into your coat reaches the coat’s edge and threads off again, still trying to get around toward Harrow’s boots—except Harrow hasn’t moved, toes lifted, breathing shallow. The coat buys seconds, not safety.

Concrete threats now:
- **Banister strands** are racing down toward the lantern and the bottom landing; if they reach the porter, they’ll have a warm body within inches.
- **Coat-thread** is still actively routing around your barrier toward Harrow’s boots.
- The street-side drop produced a **violet mist** below—whatever the hook carried is now loose in the open air outside.

“Harrow—on my count, lift your feet straight up and step back exactly one step. Don’t drag. One—TWO—NOW.”

I grab the dry inner hem of my coat (away from the soaked patch) and snap it up like a curtain, trying to scoop/flip the crawling edge inward so it has to keep eating cloth instead of finding stone.

Shouting down without looking: “Mira—keep pushing that lantern OUT. Porter too—get him into the street, wake him with your boot if you must. Nobody touches the banister.”

Then, to the clerk: “Do you have sand, ash, salt—anything dry and granular? Throw it on the banister base and the stair edge. Dry beats wet; we need it to lose its road.”

*Agent reasoning: Water made it worse; heat is baiting it downward. I need to get Harrow free without stepping into it, and redirect the whole mass away from people—preferably out into the street—while making sure Mira and the porter don’t become the next warm targets.*

To the clerk, low and urgent: “Do you have sand, ash, salt—anything dry and gritty? Get it in your hands and dump it at the banister base and along the stair edge—make the road dry.”

“Harrow—on my count, lift straight up and step back one step. No drag. One—TWO—NOW.”

I snap my coat up by the dry inner hem and fold it inward over the crawling edge like a trap, trying to force the stuff to keep eating wool instead of finding stone. “Mira—keep shoving that lantern out into the street, and boot the porter after it. Nobody touches the banister.”

To the clerk, low: “Sand, ash, salt—anything dry and granular. Get it and dump it at the banister base and along the stair edge—now.”

*Agent reasoning: The last exchange didn’t advance—either the game ate the input or we’re at a prompt reset.

“Harrow—NOW. Lift, step back one clean step—don’t drag.”

I keep my coat folded over itself, pinning the crawling edge inside the wool like a wrapped wound, and I glance down just long enough to see if any strand has found bare stone. “Mira, keep that lantern moving into the street and get the porter after it—no hands on the banister.”

To the clerk: “Sand, ash, salt—anything gritty. Fetch it and throw it along the stair edge and at the banister base.”

“What am I seeing right now—did the foam stall, split again, or did something change with that violet mist outside?”

*Agent reasoning: There’s no new scene text—either a glitch or we’re mid-action. I’ll restate my immediate priorities: get Harrow clear without dragging, keep the lantern luring it outward, and secure dry grit to break the foam’s path; also I want clarification on what the game is showing.*

#### Turn 101 **[GAME]**

Harrow obeys like you put a hook in his spine—both hands under the warped stair-runner, he lifts straight up, jaw clenched, and takes one clean step back.

The moment the fabric leaves the stone, the crawling foam threads hesitate—like they’ve lost a scent. Your coat fold catches most of it; it chews wool in a tight, busy line, making a faint, wet crackle. But two thin tendrils you didn’t see have already found purchase: they’re clinging to the banister’s lowest post, no wider than twine, and they’re *moving upward* in slow, deliberate spirals.

“No—no banister,” Mira says through her teeth as she shoulders the lantern outward. The lantern’s glass clears the doorway and the street fog swallows half its glow. The violet mist beyond the threshold *thins* where the lantern’s light hits it—like breath pulled away from a mirror—then *reforms* in a narrow band around the flame, reluctant but interested.

Mira plants the lantern on the curb. She turns and drives her boot into the porter’s shin. “Up. Now.” The porter jolts awake with a strangled yelp and immediately reaches for the rail out of habit—

Harrow barks, “Hands off!” and slaps his wrist away before he makes contact. The porter freezes, wide-eyed, holding his hands up like he’s been accused.

The clerk—young, ink-stained fingers shaking—stammers, “Ash—yes, yes,” and bolts for a back closet. You hear a drawer ripped open, then a metal scoop clattering. He returns with a tin pail of cold stove-ash and a cracked salt packet pinched from a desk.

He dumps ash at the banister base and along the stair edge. Where it hits the foam on stone, it doesn’t just dry it—it *scabs* it: the crawling edge stiffens into a gray, granular crust that stops advancing across the step.

But the two tendrils on the banister don’t die. They tighten, darken, and climb another inch, as if the wood is feeding them something the stone won’t.

Outside, the violet mist hasn’t thickened—it's *redirecting*, subtly leaning toward the lantern’s flame as if listening.

#### Turn 102 **[PLAYER]**

“Harrow, good—stay off the rail. Clerk, keep pouring ash in a line on the *steps* only; don’t waste it on the wood.”

I peel my coat back just enough to trap the chewing edge tighter, then point with two fingers at the banister tendrils. “Mira—lantern farther down the curb, slow. Keep it the warmest thing in sight.”

To the porter, sharp: “Don’t move. Look at me—have you oiled or varnished that banister recently? Spilled spirits? Any ‘cleaning’ with lye or saltwater in the last day?”

I fish a small wax-sealed vial from my kit and, without touching the rail, flick a pinch of salt toward the climbing tendrils to see if it bites or beads. “And where does that banister join the wall—any cracks, rot, or a hollow post?”

*Agent reasoning: The ash works on stone but not on wood; the banister is the real conduit. I want to learn what it is while stopping it—so I’ll isolate the banister, bait it with heat outside, and question everyone for clues.*

#### Turn 103 **[GAME]**

Harrow keeps his hands in the air, backing off the rail like it’s hot iron. The clerk nods too hard and starts laying ash *only* on the steps—a gritty gray seam that turns the foam’s leading edge into brittle crust wherever it tries to kiss stone.

You peel your coat back a finger’s width. Inside the fold, the trapped line of foam is still chewing—wool fibers go dark, then slick, then vanish into a thin, black paste that *tries* to seep out along the seam. You cinch it tighter and it stays contained, but the coat’s inner hem is now visibly thinning.

Mira drags the lantern farther down the curb, slow like you said. The violet mist follows it in a narrow, attentive drift—less a cloud now than a leash. As she moves the light away from the doorway, the mist at your threshold *thickens back in*, reclaiming the gap the lantern left.

The porter swallows, eyes locked on you. “I—yeah. The landlord had me do it. Two nights ago. Varnish. New coat. Smelled sweet—like flowers over rot.” He licks his lips. “And… saltwater. He said it keeps the wood from swelling in the damp. Poured it right along the posts.”

You flick a pinch of salt.

The grains strike the climbing tendrils and—wrongly—*bead*, as if the salt hit oil. The crystals don’t melt; they stick and turn faintly violet at the edges. The tendrils tighten under the salt like muscle under a lash, then climb faster, spiraling up the banister post toward the first landing.

Where the banister meets the wall, you see it: a hairline crack in the plaster seam that wasn’t there a moment ago, widening with each inch the tendrils gain. The crack exhales a thin, cold breath that smells of violets and old brine.

The clerk freezes mid-pour. “That wasn’t—sir, that wasn’t there—”

A soft *tick-tick-tick* comes from inside the hollow of the lowest post, like something tapping back in answer to your counting earlier.

Threat, clear: the foam is now feeding on the varnished, salt-treated wood via the banister tendrils, and something inside the hollow post/wall seam is responding and may be about to emerge through the widening crack.

“Everyone away from the banister—two steps. Clerk, keep that ash line solid on stone only. Harrow, hold my coat tight—don’t let the paste leak.”

I point at the hollow post. “Porter—who sold you that varnish, and what’s the landlord’s name? Did he say *why* saltwater?”

I edge close without touching wood and rap the *plaster beside* the crack with my knuckles—one sharp knock—then listen for the answering pattern. “Mira—bring the lantern back just enough to thin the doorway mist, then slide it sideways along the curb; I want to see if the crack ‘breath’ follows the light.”

From my kit I pull a strip of waxed paper and press it over the plaster seam above the tendrils (not the wood), trying to seal the crack’s edge and starve it of air; then I hiss, low: “If that thing comes through, we break the post—ash and cloth only. No salt.”

*Agent reasoning: The banister is the conduit—salt makes it worse, ash works on stone. Something’s inside the hollow post answering taps; I want to interrupt the feed, lure the mist away, and learn who the landlord is/what varnish was used.*

“Everyone back—two steps off the banister. Clerk, keep the ash line solid on the stone only. Harrow, grip my coat and keep the paste from leaking.”

I fix the porter with a stare. “Who sold you the varnish, what’s the landlord’s name, and what exactly did he say about the saltwater?”

I lean in close to the wall *beside* the crack and give the plaster one sharp knock, then press my ear near it to catch any answering rhythm. “Mira—bring the lantern back just enough to thin the doorway mist, then slide it sideways along the curb; tell me if the crack’s ‘breath’ follows the light.”

I pull waxed paper from my kit and press it over the plaster seam above the tendrils, trying to seal the edge without touching wood. “If something pushes through, we break the post—ash and cloth only. No salt.”

*Agent reasoning: There’s no new scene text, so I’ll restate my intent: pull everyone back, interrogate the porter for names/sources, test whether the crack responds to knocks/light, and try to seal the plaster seam to slow whatever’s inside—without touching the banister.*

#### Turn 107 **[GAME]**

Harrow clamps both hands on your coat hem and twists it into a tight roll, keeping the black paste from stringing out. A thin thread still tries to escape; he pinches it off with the coat fabric itself, grimacing as the wool smokes faintly where it touches.

The clerk retreats two steps and resumes pouring ash in a steady, unbroken line along the stone. The foam on the steps stays scabbed and stalled; it does not cross the ash.

The porter backs away, palms up. “Varnish came from Latch & Lye on Mourners’ Cut—cheap stuff. Landlord’s name is Serren Quill.” He swallows hard. “He said the saltwater was ‘for the Audit’—so the stairs ‘read clean’ if anyone came sniffing. Told me to pour it at the posts, not the steps. Said it keeps… *marks* from showing.”

You knock the plaster beside the crack: one sharp rap.

Something answers from inside the wall and the hollow post—not a knock back, but a *sequence*: three soft taps, a pause, then one longer scrape, like a fingernail dragged across wood. The same mourner’s code that woke you this morning, only warped—off by half a beat.

When you press your ear close, you hear breathing—thin and cold—coming from the crack. Under it, a wet whispering like pages being turned with a tongue.

Mira brings the lantern closer until the doorway mist thins again, then slides it sideways along the curb as instructed. The violet mist *tracks the lantern immediately*, pulling like a curtain being drawn. The crack’s breath responds a heartbeat later: as the light moves left, the cold exhale from the plaster seam shifts left too, as if whatever’s inside is orienting toward the warm glow.

You press waxed paper over the seam above the tendrils. The paper adheres to damp plaster—then bulges outward as pressure builds behind it. A dark, oily damp spreads under the wax like ink in blotting paper. The bulge holds for a second… then a thin puncture appears dead center, pushed from within by something pointed.

At the banister, the tendrils climb faster, tightening into a braided cord. The hairline crack widens another fraction, and a sliver of black glassy sheen—like a nail or shard—protrudes through the puncture in your waxed paper, testing.

Threat is immediate and specific: something inside the wall/post is probing through your seal and orienting toward the lantern’s warmth; the banister tendrils are acting as its conduit, and it is seconds from forcing a larger breach.

“Mira—lantern OUT. Farther down the street, quick—make it chase. Then kill it if you can do it without coming back near the door.”

I grab the clerk by the sleeve and shove him back. “More ash—make a thick pile at the base of the post, on the stone, like a berm.”

To Harrow, urgent: “Keep that coat wrapped—do not let any paste touch wood.”

I shrug off my other coat sleeve and whip the fabric around my hand like a glove, then hook it around the banister post *without skin contact* and yank hard, trying to snap the post at its base and drag it down onto the ash. “Porter—Serren Quill. Latch & Lye. You’re coming with me after this—if we live.”

As the waxed paper punctures, I lean close and hiss at the hole, trying the mourner’s code back—three taps on the plaster, pause, then a long drag with my nail. “Who’s auditing you?”

*Agent reasoning: The thing is homing on warmth/light and using the varnished, salt-treated wood as a conduit; I want to misdirect it outside and then physically break the conduit without touching it directly, while grabbing the landlord lead for later.*

#### Turn 109 **[GAME]**

Mira doesn’t argue. She snuffs the lantern in one hard pinch, then runs it—dark—down the curb. The violet mist hesitates, then *thins* at the doorway like a lung losing interest. A moment later, it starts sliding after her anyway, less eager without the flame, but still drawn to the lantern’s last warmth.

You grab the clerk and shove him back. He stumbles, catches himself, then dumps half his tin in a frantic pour. Ash spills where you wanted it—stone at the base of the post—forming a thick berm, but he also dusts the lowest inch of the post by accident. Where ash touches the varnished wood, it cakes and turns slick, as if the wood is sweating oil.

Harrow keeps the coat rolled tight. “It’s eating through,” he grits, and you smell singed wool. The paste stays contained—barely.

You wrap your sleeve around your hand and hook it around the banister post. The moment fabric contacts the varnished wood, it *sticks*—not glue, more like suction. You yank anyway.

The post doesn’t snap clean. It tears.

The base gives with a wet crack and a shower of splinters, and the braided tendrils whip downward like cut ropes—slapping into the ash berm. The ash hisses and blackens where they land, buying you a second: the tendrils seize, twitching, unable to cross the thickest ash without losing substance.

But the tear opens the hollow.

From inside the post, something pushes forward—thin, jointed, black-glass sheen like a finger made of bottle shards. It probes once, then *hooks* a splinter and tries to pull itself toward the gap you made. The motion is deliberate, strong, and close enough now that you can hear a faint clicking, like teeth tapping on glass.

You tap the mourner’s code back into the plaster by the punctured waxed paper.

The wall answers immediately: three soft taps—perfectly timed—then, instead of a scrape, a *voice* squeezes through the puncture as a wet whisper:

“**DECENCY.**”

The puncture widens a hair, and a sliver of black-glass “nail” presses out, testing air. It angles—not toward you now, but toward the direction Mira ran, as if tracking the lantern’s fading heat.

Immediate threats, concrete:
- The hollow-post breach is active: a shard-fingered thing is trying to lever itself out through the torn base.
- The ash berm is burning it back but also blackening and thinning where the tendrils touch.
- The wall seam entity can speak and is orienting toward Mira’s movement; if it follows her, it may leave the doorway and enter the street.

“Harrow—drop my coat bundle onto the ash line on the steps, now. Let it eat wool, not wood—keep it on stone.”

I snap at the clerk, “More ash—pack it tight around that torn base like you’re sandbagging a flood. If you’ve got a metal scoop, use it—no bare hands.”

Toward the street I shout, “Mira! Don’t stop—keep moving, and if the mist closes in, ditch the lantern and run lightless!”

I lean close to the puncture without touching it and whisper back, steady, “Decency audits don’t use varnish and brine. Who is Serren Quill paying—name it. And what do you want with warmth?”

*Agent reasoning: The entity is tracking Mira and trying to breach through both post and wall; I want to keep it contained and learn what “DECENCY” means while not sacrificing Mira. I’ll redirect heat away, reinforce the ash barrier, and interrogate the voice briefly.*

I call down the curb, “Mira! Keep moving—if the mist crowds you, drop the lantern and run dark!”

I lean near the wax puncture, voice low. “You said ‘Decency.’ Who’s Serren Quill paying—name it. What do you want with warmth?”

*Agent reasoning: There’s no new scene text, so I’ll press the advantage—secure the ash containment at the torn base, keep Mira safe, and interrogate the speaking presence through the puncture for names and motive.*

#### Turn 113 **[GAME]**

Harrow lurches forward and does it—drops the tight wool bundle onto the ash line on the steps, careful to keep it on bare stone. The bundle hits with a soft thud.

The black paste reacts like it’s smelled meat. It seeps through the wool in slow, hungry veins, smoking the fabric from within. The ash line holds it in place; it spreads outward across stone but doesn’t leap the ash. The wool darkens, then stiffens as if lacquered. Harrow jerks his hands back fast. “It’s taking,” he says, voice tight. “But it’ll go through the whole roll.”

The clerk, pale and shaking, fumbles a small metal dust-scoop out of his ledger satchel. He starts packing ash around the torn post base exactly like sandbags—tight, high, and thick. Where the shard-finger tries to lever itself out, it meets the ash and recoils with a sharp clicking, like glass chattering. The ash blackens in a crescent where it touches the thing, but the thicker packing forces it to withdraw an inch at a time.

Down the street, Mira’s boots slap wet stone. You hear her shout back without stopping: “I’m moving!” The violet mist peels away from the doorway in a thin streamer, following the path of her last warmth. It doesn’t surge; it *hunts*, keeping low along the curb like a tide with a mind.

At the wax puncture, you lean close and speak.

The wall answers in a wet, controlled whisper, each word pushed as if through a throat full of brine:

“Quill pays **Tollin Wreave**… to stamp *clean*.”

A pause—breathing, shallow and cold.

“Wreave pays the **Lantern**… to keep lovers… *tidy*.”

The puncture flexes. The black-glass nail angles, tasting the air.

“Warmth is a **witness**,” it says. “Warmth remembers where hands were. We take it. We file it. We make it… decent.”

Then the nail presses harder. The waxed paper creaks as the puncture widens another fraction, and a thin line of oily damp begins to run down the plaster under the paper—your seal is starting to fail.

Immediate, clear threats:
- The coat bundle is buying time, but the paste is actively consuming it; when it finishes, it will seek the next surface.
- The ash packing is holding the shard-finger in, but the ash is blackening and thinning at contact points.
- The wall puncture is enlarging; the entity is forcing a broader breach through your waxed-paper cover.
- The mist is now moving down the street after Mira; if it reaches her and she drops the lantern, it may switch to another heat source—any living body nearby.

I snap to the porter, “You—rip a strip off your shirt. Now.” Then to the clerk: “Ash in my palm—no, in the scoop—dust the *plaster* around the waxed paper, make it dry, make it bite.”

I pull my tinder-tin and strike a spark into it just long enough to warm the metal, then clamp it shut and set it on the stone *inside* the ash line, a deliberate little heat-lure away from the puncture. “If warmth is a witness, then watch that.”

Leaning close to the puncture, I keep my voice calm. “Tollin Wreave. The Lantern. Tell me what the Lantern is—person, guild, or relic—and where Wreave stamps ‘clean.’ One address. One room.”

*Agent reasoning: The breach is widening and the mist is hunting Mira; I want to learn what “the Lantern” is while buying seconds. I’ll redirect the entity’s attention with controlled warmth, reinforce the seal with ash, and prepare an exit/containment plan.*

#### Turn 115 **[GAME]**

The porter—Harrow—doesn’t ask why. He grabs the hem of his undershirt and rips hard. Cloth tears with a long, ugly sound. He hands you a strip, then immediately presses his palm to his ribs like he’s suddenly remembered he’s human. “That enough?”

The clerk obeys your correction on the spot. He keeps the ash off his skin, loads the metal scoop, and dusts the plaster around the waxed paper in quick, careful taps. The damp sheen on the wall goes matte where the ash lands. The waxed paper stops creaking for half a breath—as if the seam hates dryness.

You pop your tinder-tin, strike a spark just long enough to warm the metal, snap it shut, and set it on the stone inside the ash line.

The reaction is immediate.

The violet mist at the doorway doesn’t fully detach from the street-hunt after Mira, but a *new thread* of it curls back toward your steps, drawn to the tin’s heat like a nose finding soup. It slides along the ground, touches the ash line, and recoils—then tests again, searching for a thin spot.

At the torn post base, the shard-finger pauses its levering and angles toward the tin. The clicking changes pitch—faster, eager. It drags itself a fraction closer, but the clerk’s packed ash holds it back. The ash at that point blackens more quickly now, thinning under the repeated contact.

You lean in and ask your question.

The puncture answers—calm, almost bureaucratic:

“The Lantern is a **Society** with a **heart**. Not a person. Not a relic you can carry.”

A pause. The black-glass nail presses, then *slips* slightly against the newly-ashed plaster as if it’s lost purchase.

“Wreave stamps clean in the **Civic Mourning Office**, Lower Registry—**Room 3B**.”

It exhales something briny through the hole, and the waxed paper *dips inward* like it’s being sucked.

Then it adds, softer, with a strange, possessive edge:

“Bring warmth there. Let it testify.”

Concrete danger, now:
- Your heated tinder-tin has successfully pulled attention: a strand of mist is returning toward the steps and actively probing the ash line for a weakness.
- The shard-finger is distracted but still contained; the ash around the torn base is degrading faster under repeated tests.
- The wall seam lost leverage briefly from the ash-drying, but it’s now applying suction from inside; if the waxed paper seal fails, the breach will widen abruptly.

#### Turn 116 **[PLAYER]**

I tie Harrow’s torn shirt-strip tight over the waxed paper like a tourniquet, then smear ash into the cloth to dry it out and blunt the suction. “Clerk—keep feeding that berm, especially where it’s blackening; if it turns slick again, tell me.”

I nudge the warm tinder-tin a few inches farther from the door, still inside the ash line, trying to keep the mist and shard-finger occupied on stone. Into the puncture, low and sharp: “Societies have marks. What’s the Lantern’s sign—on paper, on skin, on doors?”

*Agent reasoning: The breach is still active; I need to reinforce the seal and keep the entities focused on a controlled lure while extracting one more useful detail. I’m also curious about this “Society with a heart,” so I’ll press for a symbol/mark while acting fast.*

#### Turn 117 **[GAME]**

You cinch Harrow’s torn strip over the waxed paper, tight enough that the plaster beneath creaks. The cloth bites into the wall like a bandage on a throat. When you smear ash into it, the fabric goes from limp to stiff, turning gray and crusted.

The suction behind the puncture stutters—noticeably weaker. The waxed paper stops bowing inward and settles flat under the pressure of the tourniquet. A thin ooze that had started to run down the plaster dries to a gritty, dark line and stops moving.

The clerk keeps his distance, face turned away, and shovels more ash into the berm with the metal scoop. “It’s blackening here—left side—like tar on snow,” he says, voice pinched. He packs it harder. The blackened patch holds, but it’s now visibly *thinner* than the rest of the berm; you can see stone through it in flecks.

You nudge the warm tinder-tin a few inches farther from the door, still inside the ash line. The mist-thread that had been testing the edge follows the heat’s new position like a leash being tugged. It slides along the stone toward the tin, then pools there, pressing its “face” to the ash line and worrying at it in small, repetitive pushes.

At the torn base, the shard-finger clicks and angles after the same lure. It drags, but the ash berm denies it purchase; each attempt leaves a fresh crescent of blackened ash.

You speak into the puncture.

For a moment nothing answers—just a faint, wet rasp against paper and cloth, like someone licking a stamp.

Then the whisper comes, careful, as if choosing words that won’t incriminate it:

“On paper: a **lantern** drawn with a **closed eye** in the flame.”

“On skin: a **warm spot** that never cools. Behind the ear. Inside the wrist. Lovers kiss it without knowing why.”

“On doors: a **lacquer drip**—black varnish shaped like a teardrop—set above the latch.”

The puncture shifts under your tourniquet. The nail inside *scrapes* once, frustrated.

And from the street beyond the steps, the mist-thread suddenly *thickens*—not crossing the ash, but gathering as if more of it has found the lure. If that ash line fails at its thinnest, it won’t be a trickle coming in.

No inventory changes.

#### Turn 118 **[PLAYER]**

I scan above the latch for that black varnish teardrop mark, then bark, “Clerk—more ash, *now*, and lay something flat over the thin patch—tile, ledger board, anything stone or metal—no wood.”  

I slide my sleeve-gloved hand to the warm tinder-tin and nudge it farther along the stone, trying to draw the thickening mist away from the weak spot.  

Into the puncture, quick and intent: “Closed-eye lantern, warm spot, lacquer drip—who in this house bears it? Quill? The porter? Point me at one marked throat.”

*Agent reasoning: The ash line’s thinning where the mist is pressing; I need to reinforce it with something non-porous and keep the entity talking for more intel while checking for the Lantern’s door-mark on this building.*

#### Turn 119 **[GAME]**

You flick your eyes to the door hardware.

Above the latch, half-hidden under peeling paint and salt bloom, there’s a glossy black drip—too deliberate to be water damage. A teardrop of lacquer set like a punctuation mark. Someone put it there and wanted it overlooked.

The clerk jolts at your barked order and overfills the scoop, ash spilling onto his shoes. He dumps it onto the berm with shaking hands. “Flat—flat—” He looks around like the room might provide a miracle. No tile. No metal plate. The nearest “board” is his ledger’s stiff backing—but it’s wrapped in treated leather and pasteboard, and he hesitates at your “no wood” like it’s a gun to his head.

Harrow makes the call instead. He yanks a thin, battered **tin serving tray** off a side table by the stairs—tarnished, dented, but metal. He slides it toward the thin patch with his boot, stopping short of the ash line. “That work?”

You nudge the warm tinder-tin farther along the stone.

The mist responds like a dog to a whistle: it peels away from the weak spot and follows the heat, pooling and pressing against the ash line where the tin now sits. The pressure at the thinned patch eases—briefly. But the mist is thicker now, and its testing is more coordinated: repeated pushes in the same place, like it’s learning.

At the post base, the shard-finger keeps clicking, still drawn toward the tin. Each click leaves another black crescent in the ash berm where it’s been worrying the boundary.

You snap your question into the puncture.

The answer comes slower this time, irritated—then sharp, certain:

“The marked throat is **not Quill**.”

A pause. The nail scrapes once under the tourniquet.

“The porter.”

Harrow freezes so hard you can hear his breath stop. His hand goes up, reflexively, to the side of his neck—behind the ear. When his fingers touch skin there, he flinches like he found a burn. “I— I don’t—” he starts, then swallows. His eyes dart to the lacquer drip above the latch as if it’s accusing him personally.

The clerk, still crouched at the berm, stares at Harrow with a new kind of fear and edges his knees backward, away from him, without standing.

Threats made plain:
- The lacquer drip confirms this door is Lantern-marked.
- The mist is now massing at the ash line near your heat lure; if the line fails anywhere, it will pour in fast.
- Harrow is identified as marked; his panic could spike “warmth” and draw the mist’s attention if he bolts or breaks the boundary.

#### Turn 120 **[PLAYER]**

I grab Harrow by the collar and pull him close, hard but controlled. “Don’t touch it, don’t run—breathe shallow. You bolt, you feed it.” I angle his head and, without bare skin contact, peer behind his ear for the warm spot/branding.

To the clerk: “Slide the tin tray flat over the thin patch like a lid—then heap ash on the tray’s edges to weight it. Keep your hands metal-to-ash only.”

I lean back to the puncture, voice like a scalpel. “What does the mark *do*—beacon, leash, or key? And how do I make him cold enough to stop being a witness?”

*Agent reasoning: Harrow being marked makes him both a target and a key; I want to inspect the mark and keep him calm while shoring up the ash line with that tin tray. Also, I want more info from the puncture about what the mark does and how to mute “warmth.”*

#### Turn 121 **[GAME]**

Your fist knots in Harrow’s collar and you haul him in. The fabric bunches under your knuckles; his breath catches, then comes back in short, obedient sips like you ordered. His eyes are wide but fixed on yours—anchored by the fact that you’re treating him like a problem with steps, not a man being judged.

You angle his head. Keeping your sleeve between you and his skin, you peer behind his ear.

There’s a spot the size of a thumbnail that looks normal until you stop blinking: the skin there has a faint, varnish-like sheen, as if it’s been lacquered from the inside. No visible ink. No raised scar. But the air above it feels subtly wrong—like standing near a kettle you can’t see. When Harrow exhales, the sheen brightens a fraction, then dulls.

At your command, the clerk doesn’t argue. He hooks the tin serving tray with the edge of his metal scoop and slides it forward, flat, over the thin blackening patch like a lid. The tray kisses ash with a soft scrape. He then heaps ash along the tray’s edges, packing it down with the scoop’s back until the metal is choked in gray. The thinned patch is no longer exposed.

Immediate effect: the mist’s probing at that weak spot stops. It shifts its pressure toward the nearest unreinforced arc of the ash line—closer to where your warm tinder-tin now sits—and begins pushing there instead, the fog thickening into a denser, more muscular smear against the boundary.

You lean into the puncture.

The voice answers, precise and unpleasantly satisfied:

“**Beacon** first. It tells the Society where the warmth is.”

“**Leash** second. It tugs when the invitation is near. When the music starts.”

A pause—something scrapes under your cloth tourniquet, testing.

“**Key** last. It opens *him*. Not doors.”

When you ask how to make him cold enough, the puncture exhales brine again, and the reply comes like a recipe:

“Take the warmth away. **Saltwater on the mark.** Cold iron close. Keep his mouth shut. Keep his pulse slow.”

As it speaks, Harrow’s lacquer-sheen flares—just once—like the mark heard its own description. The mist outside responds: a thicker tongue of it peels off the pooled mass and slides along the step toward Harrow’s side of the doorway, stopping at the ash line as if scenting him specifically.

Harrow whispers, barely moving his lips, “I didn’t ask for it.”

The threat is now directional: the mist isn’t just testing the barrier randomly; it’s orienting toward Harrow’s marked heat, and it’s concentrating pressure near the lure you control. If the ash line breaks there, it will surge straight toward him.

#### Turn 122 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my grip on Harrow, forehead nearly to his, and murmur, “I believe you. Now do exactly what I say—no talking, no big breaths.”  

To the clerk: “Water—salt, now. Anything briny: kitchen crock, pickling jar, sea bucket—move.”  

I slide the warm tinder-tin a handspan farther along the stone to pull the mist’s pressure away from Harrow’s side, then fish for anything cold iron on me—keyring, nail, clasp—and hold it close to the mark without touching.  

Low to the puncture: “What ‘music’ starts the leash? Who plays it—where?”

*Agent reasoning: The mist is keying on Harrow’s mark; I need to chill/interrupt it with saltwater and iron fast while keeping him calm, and keep the ash line from failing where the lure sits. Also want more intel from the puncture but not at the cost of a breach.*

#### Turn 123 **[GAME]**

Harrow goes still under your grip. He nods once, minuscule. His breathing turns shallow and metered; the lacquer-sheen behind his ear dulls a touch, like a flame starved of air.

The clerk scrambles, nearly slipping in ash. “Brine—yes—” He bolts up the stairs two at a time, scoop clattering. You hear a cupboard thrown open, ceramic knocking ceramic, then the slosh of liquid. He’s moving fast enough to be useful, but not quietly.

You slide the warm tinder-tin a handspan farther along the stone.

The mist obeys the heat. The thick smear that had been orienting toward Harrow’s side peels away and migrates along the ash line toward the tin’s new position, pressing there in repeated, coordinated shoves. The reinforced thin patch under the tray holds. The ash line where the mist now pushes begins to blacken in small crescents—stress marks, not yet a breach.

You fish out cold iron: your keyring has an old, pitted iron key on it—real iron, not plated. You hold it close to the mark without touching.

The air around Harrow’s ear prickles. The lacquer-sheen reacts like oil meeting a magnet: it tightens, then dims. Harrow’s eyes squeeze shut for a second, jaw clenched, but he doesn’t pull away. The mist outside falters for half a heartbeat—its “push” stutters—then resumes, harder, as if angry at losing the scent.

You put the question to the puncture.

The voice answers immediately, like it’s been waiting to say it:

“The **waltz** that isn’t written down.”

“Three notes. Then the fourth is a **name**.”

It pauses; the nail scrapes once, slow.

“Played at **Sableglass**. In the pit where the audience can’t see hands. The Lantern’s musician—**Maestro Celyne**—keeps the leash-time.”

As it finishes, the waxed paper over the puncture draws inward sharply, straining under your tourniquet, and a thin line of damp brine seeps at the cloth edge—pressure building behind the seal.

Footsteps hammer back down the stairs: the clerk returns clutching a squat pickling jar, hands slick. “Salt—salt water,” he pants, holding it out like an offering.

Right now the threats are clear and immediate:
- The mist is concentrating its force where your tinder-tin sits; that segment of ash line is blackening and weakening.
- Pressure behind the puncture is increasing; your tourniquet is holding, but it’s being tested.
- You have brine in hand, and cold iron is damping the mark—temporarily.

No inventory changes yet (the jar is being held out, not in your possession).

I snatch the pickling jar, wet my gloved fingers, and dab brine onto the lacquer-spot behind Harrow’s ear—then hold my old iron key close again, steady. “Good. Quiet. Small breaths.”

“Clerk—dump a heavy crescent of ash where it’s blackening, and slide that tin tray over to *cap* the weak arc by the tinder-tin. I want metal between mist and line.”

I nudge the tinder-tin farther inward, away from the boundary, then press my ash-stiffened cloth tourniquet tighter over the waxed paper. Into the puncture, low: “Maestro Celyne—what does he *get* for playing? Coin, names, or bodies?”

*Agent reasoning: We need to cool Harrow’s mark immediately (brine + iron) and stabilize the failing ash line by relocating/insulating the heat lure; also the puncture pressure is rising, so reinforce the tourniquet and stop feeding it attention.*

#### Turn 131 **[GAME]**

Brine hits the lacquer-spot and the warmth there flinches—like you’ve touched skin that isn’t sure it belongs to Harrow. The sheen behind his ear turns briefly cloudy, then clears in a tight spiral, as if the salt is forcing something to re-write itself.

You bring the pitted iron key close. Not touching—still, the air around the key goes thin and cold. The lacquer-spot answers with a faint, insectile clicking you feel more than hear. Harrow’s jaw locks; he takes the “small breaths” you ordered, shallow and obedient, eyes wide on a point past your shoulder.

The clerk—sleeves rolled, face gray with the kind of fear that tries to become professionalism—does what you said. Ash pours in a heavy crescent where the blackening was creeping. It doesn’t stop the stain so much as *pins it*; the black edge hesitates, then reroutes along the ash like it’s following a rail.

He slides the tin tray into place. The moment metal bridges that weak arc, the mist at the boundary buckles inward, like a curtain yanked. A thin line of condensation beads along the tray’s lip—then freezes. The tinder-tin you nudge farther in gives a small, unhappy *ping* as if something tapped it from the other side.

You cinch the ash-stiffened cloth tighter. Harrow hisses through his teeth. Under the waxed paper, the puncture’s seep changes: not more blood—less. What does leak is darker and syrup-slow, and it carries that violet-amber perfume note, faint but unmistakable.

When you murmur into the puncture, the answer doesn’t come from Harrow’s mouth at first. It comes from the lacquer-spot behind his ear, vibrating against your brined fingertips—like a throat trying to speak through sealed lips.

Then Harrow speaks anyway, voice doubled, his own underneath and something smooth riding on top:

“Bodies,” it says, too quickly—then corrects itself with a little laugh that isn’t his. “No. Names that *become* bodies. Couples in ledgers. Seats filled at a theater that isn’t only a theater.”

His eyes flick to your iron key like it burns.

“Celyne gets… a clean page,” the borrowed voice adds, suddenly strained. “A pardon from the Audit. Permission to keep playing when the city decides music is indecent.”

The blackening at the ash-crescent twitches, testing the line again—this time pushing a hair-thin tendril toward the clerk’s ankle, slow and deliberate, like it’s learned where the fear is.

“Clerk—don’t move. Look at me, not the line. Slow breaths.”

I flick a pinch of brine in a short arc across the tendril’s path, then jab the iron key down to the stone beside it—still not touching the mist—using the cold iron like a threat to herd it back toward the ash-crescent.

Keeping my forehead near Harrow’s, I murmur, “Audit. Clean page. Which ledger—whose names? And ‘Sableglass’—is that the Lantern’s theater, or somewhere under it?”

*Agent reasoning: The tendril is going for the clerk—if it tags him we lose our helper and maybe the whole circle. Also the “Audit” and “clean page” are juicy leads, but I need the entity pinned before I interrogate further. I’ll protect the clerk, reinforce the barrier, and press for specifics: what ledger, what theater, what “Lantern.”*

#### Turn 133 **[GAME]**

The clerk freezes on your command like he’s been waiting all his life to be told *exactly* how to be brave. He locks eyes with you, jaw trembling, and forces his breath to match your cadence. The tendril pauses—then falters, as if attention was part of what fed it.

Your pinch of brine arcs out and spatters the stone. Where the droplets land, the hair-thin black line recoils in tight, jerky pulls, like a worm hitting salt. It tries to split around the wet spots—can’t—so it retreats, sliding back toward the ash-crescent with the reluctance of something being shoved into a corner.

You jab the iron key down beside it. The stone around the keyhead frosts in a coin-sized bloom. The mist doesn’t touch the iron, but it *acts* like it has: the tendril flattens, thins, and slinks backward along the ash rail, tucking itself into the darker patch as if hiding behind a legal technicality.

Harrow’s forehead meets yours—clammy, fever-hot. His pupils jitter. The voice that answers you is still doubled, but now it’s fighting for purchase.

“Which ledger—” Harrow’s own voice starts, then the smooth one cuts in, impatient:

“Lower Registry,” it says. “Room numbers. Ink that bites. Not the public books.”

Harrow swallows hard; his throat works like he’s choking on a word.

“Names of the *nearly* dead,” the smooth voice continues, softer now, as if savoring it. “Names of the *unmourned*. The ones the Office can reclassify. Unregistered grief—easy to move. Easy to pair.”

At “Sableglass,” the lacquer-spot behind his ear clicks again, faster—warning, not speech.

“The Lantern’s theater,” the voice says, and then—an involuntary flinch—“and under it.”

Harrow’s eyes roll toward the boundary line, then snap back to you like a dog yanked by a chain.

“Under the stage,” he whispers in his own voice, raw and terrified. “A second door. Salt stairs. I saw it once—only once—when they brought in the charity crates. It wasn’t crates.”

The clerk makes a small sound—half sob, half laugh—and clamps his mouth shut, still staring at you. The ash-crescent holds, but you see the blackening begin to *learn*: it stops pushing at ankles and starts tracing along the tin tray’s frozen lip, seeking a gap where brine hasn’t kissed stone yet.

“Clerk—good. Keep your eyes on me. If you feel cold on your ankle, you tell me before you move.”

I drag a brine-wet fingertip along the tin tray’s frozen lip where the blackening is tracing, sealing the edge in a quick, continuous line, then sprinkle a thin dusting of ash over the wet like I’m salting a wound. “No gaps. Not one.”

Forehead still to Harrow’s, I whisper, “Lower Registry—whose room numbers? Give me one. And that second door under the Lantern: what’s the mark on it—lock shape, symbol, smell?”

*Agent reasoning: The mist is adapting and probing the tray edge; I want to reinforce the barrier while extracting more specifics about the Lower Registry and the under-stage access. Also, keeping the clerk calm maintains control, and Harrow’s lucid moments are precious.*

#### Turn 135 **[GAME]**

The clerk nods without looking away from you. His lips move with the count of his own breath. “Cold—tell. Before—move.” He repeats it like a ward.

Your brine-wet fingertip drags along the tin tray’s frozen lip. The frost smears, turns to slick water, then refreezes in a cleaner, harder line as the salt takes. The blackening that was tracing the lip hits your wet seal and stops dead—no hesitation, no probing. It *can’t* cross. It bunches up behind the brine line like soot caught in a gutter.

You dust ash over the wet. The ash drinks the brine and sets into a gritty, gray crust. The tray’s edge looks stitched shut.

But the mist doesn’t surrender—its pressure changes. The boundary line pulls inward a fraction, as if whatever’s on the far side has decided to stop testing the “door” and start leaning on the “wall.” The air inside your circle grows colder; Harrow’s breath fogs.

Forehead to forehead, you press the questions.

The lacquer-spot behind Harrow’s ear vibrates against your brined glove. The doubled voice answers, clipped now, like it’s being forced through teeth:

“Room 3B,” it says. “Lower Registry. Tollin Wreave carries the keys when the senior hands are ‘praying.’”

At the name, the clerk’s eyes flick—just once—to the satchel on the floor like he knows exactly whose handwriting is on the tag.

Harrow’s own voice breaks through in a hoarse rush, as if he’s trying to get it out before the other thing clamps down again.

“Under the Lantern—door’s not wood. It’s… glass painted black from the inside. The mark is a lovers’ knot, but wrong—one loop’s cut, like it’s been half-scraped off brick.” His eyes squeeze shut. “Smells like violet-amber ash and… seawater left in a copper cup.”

The smooth voice returns, quieter, satisfied: “A lock that isn’t a lock. It opens for the paired.”

As it speaks, the ash-crescent near the blackening darkens—not spreading, but deepening, as if soaking up light. The clerk suddenly inhales sharp.

“Cold,” he says, teeth chattering. “On my ankle.”

He still hasn’t moved—yet. But the threat is clear: whatever you’ve pinned at the tray is now reaching for a new purchase, and it’s found flesh.

“Don’t lift your foot—don’t kick. Just lock your knee and let me do it.”

I slide my brine-wet glove down and paint a fast ring of brine on the stone around his ankle without touching his skin, then pour a tight crescent of ash outside that ring like a collar. “Eyes on me. Breathe.”

Without breaking contact with Harrow, I angle my iron key close to the clerk’s ankle—still not touching the mist—then hiss to the thing in Harrow’s voice, “Room 3B. Tollin Wreave. Say what he *is*—clerk, auditor, or choir—then tell me what makes a ‘pair’ that opens Sableglass.”

*Agent reasoning: The mist is shifting targets to the clerk’s ankle; I need to keep him still, break its contact, and learn what Tollin Wreave/Room 3B implies before the entity adapts again.*

#### Turn 138 **[PLAYER]**

I snap my gaze around the circle—tray lip, ash crescent, the clerk’s ankle, Harrow’s lacquer-spot—checking what shifted when everything went blank. “Clerk, report—cold still there? Any numbness?”  
I keep the iron key poised near the ankle and press my forehead to Harrow again. “Tollin Wreave—what is he, and what makes a ‘pair’ that opens Sableglass?”

*Agent reasoning: The screen blanked—either a glitch or a transition. My curious instinct is to probe the immediate danger first (clerk’s ankle, Harrow’s possession), then ask for clarification about what changed in the scene.*

#### Turn 139 **[GAME]**

Your circle is still intact.

- The tin tray’s lip is crusted in gray ash where you sealed it; the blackening is bunched up behind that seam like tar behind a dam.
- The ash-crescent near Harrow has deepened to a near-black bruise, but it hasn’t crossed your line.
- The clerk’s ankle is inside your new brine ring—clean stone, wet sheen. Outside it, your ash “collar” sits like a shallow gutter.

The clerk’s eyes are wide and watering. He doesn’t move his foot—he’s locked his knee exactly as told.

“Cold’s… still there,” he reports, voice shaking. “Like—like a hand under my sock. Numbness starting in my toes. Not up the calf. Not yet.”

As you bring your forehead back to Harrow’s, the lacquer-spot behind his ear gives a tight, rapid tick—like a watch trying to keep time underwater. Harrow’s breath catches; his throat works.

The doubled voice answers you with a bureaucrat’s precision, and there’s irritation in it now—like you’ve made it fill out a form it hates.

“Tollin Wreave is not a clerk,” it says through Harrow. “Registrar’s assistant by title. **Choir** by function. He carries keys. He carries names. He sings the numbers into ink so the ink remembers.”

Harrow’s own voice squeezes through on the edge of a whisper: “He’s always… too clean. Hands never stained.”

You ask what makes a pair.

The smooth voice softens, almost indulgent.

“A pair is a grief accounted for twice,” it says. “Two names that share a ledger-line. Two losses that can be made to rhyme. The permit doesn’t open doors—**the matching** does.”

Your Sableglass invitation, lying where you dropped it earlier, bleeds perfume a little harder into the air at that word—violet and amber, with the faint copper tang Harrow described.

Then the threat makes itself plain: the cold at the clerk’s ankle *moves*. Not inside your brine ring—*along its edge*, skimming the boundary like a finger tracing a cuff, searching for the moment he flinches.

The clerk gasps, teeth clicking. “It’s—circling.”

Harrow’s eyes snap open, unfocused, and the lacquer-spot ticks once—loud—like a latch testing itself.

#### Turn 140 **[PLAYER]**

“Clerk—put your weight on your heel only. Don’t let your toes curl. Stare at my left eye and count backward from twenty.”

I hook the iron key under the edge of the Sableglass invitation without touching it with my glove and drag it, slow, to the tin tray’s crusted lip—pinning the card against the metal like a specimen. Then I flick a razor-thin line of brine along the *outer* edge of the clerk’s ash collar, making a second track. “Circle the circle all you like—there’s no seam to bite.”

Forehead still to Harrow’s, voice low and sharp: “You said matching. What’s the rule—same blood, same loss, same date, same room number? Tell me what makes two griefs ‘rhyme,’ and I’ll stop tightening the cage.”

*Agent reasoning: The cold is testing for a flinch; I need to stabilize the clerk’s leg and distract/anchor the entity while extracting one more concrete detail about “matching.” The invitation reacting is a clue—use it as bait/anchor without breaking the circle.*

I snap my eyes over the circle—tray seam, ash-crescent, clerk’s ankle, Harrow’s lacquer-spot. “Clerk, keep counting—cold still circling or did it stop? Any numbness climbing?”  
I keep the iron key poised and press my forehead to Harrow again. “You said ‘matching’—what’s the rule that makes two griefs rhyme: blood, date, room number, cause? Tell me.”

*Agent reasoning: The screen went blank again—something is interfering. I need to re-establish the immediate situation, confirm the clerk’s condition, and probe Harrow/the entity for the “pairing” rule while keeping the warding tight.*

#### Turn 144 **[PLAYER]**

I freeze mid-breath and scan the room for any change in light, sound, or temperature. “Alright—time out. Narrator, what’s the current state of the circle: tray seam, ash crescent, the clerk’s ankle cold, and Harrow’s lacquer spot—what changed since my last line?”

*Agent reasoning: The display went blank twice; I need to re-establish what the scene state is before I make a move, and I’m curious whether the “matching” rule has consequences I can exploit.*

#### Turn 145 **[GAME]**

The room answers your freeze with a few hard facts.

**Light:** The gaslamp over your desk gutters once—an inward pull rather than a flicker—then steadies. The halo around it tightens, like someone cinched a drawstring. Shadows along the baseboards lean a fraction toward the tin tray.

**Sound:** The building noise (pipes, distant street) goes thin for two heartbeats. In that thinness you can hear two distinct rhythms:
- the clerk’s teeth clicking as he counts under his breath,
- the lacquer-spot behind Harrow’s ear ticking—*not* steady now. It’s doing **two quick ticks, a pause, one tick**. Like a code.

**Temperature:** The cold at the clerk’s ankle is still present, but it’s changed behavior. It isn’t circling the brine boundary anymore. It’s **testing**: pressing in one point, releasing, pressing again a few inches away—like a thumb checking for soft wood.

Now, the specific checks you asked for:

1) **Tin tray seam:** The ash crust at the lip has **split into a hairline crack** right where you’d sealed it earlier, no wider than a thread. From that crack, a damp shine beads—*not water*. It’s slightly oily, and it smells faintly of violet-amber perfume when you lean close.

2) **Ash-crescent near Harrow:** The crescent has **spread by about a finger’s width** along the floor toward the clerk’s stance, but it hasn’t crossed your lines. The new growth is darker and finer-grained, like it burned hotter.

3) **Clerk’s ankle cold:** The clerk—Tollin—keeps counting, voice thin: “...twelve… eleven…” He swallows hard. “Cold’s still at the foot. Numbness is **to the ball of the foot now**. Not up the ankle. It’s like it’s trying to make me *move*.”

4) **Harrow’s lacquer-spot:** The spot has **raised** slightly, like a welt under the skin. The ticking-code continues. Harrow’s eyes are open now, unfocused, and he whispers without looking at you: “Vesper… it’s listening to the permit.”

As he says that, the **UNREGISTERED** stamp in your satchel gives a soft, papery *creak*—the sound of ink flexing—though nothing touches it.

#### Turn 146 **[PLAYER]**

“Tollin—keep your heel down. If your toes curl, it wins. Keep counting.”

I lean in close to Harrow’s ear and whisper, “Two-two-one… you’re ticking code. What’s it mean—‘pair’? ‘room’? ‘Wreave’?” Then, without breaking my brine lines, I slide my satchel strap up with my elbow and nudge it farther from the tray with my boot—slow, no sudden movements.

Keeping the iron key between me and the tray, I angle it toward that hairline crack and murmur, “You want the permit? Fine—talk through Harrow and I’ll let you smell it. What is the exact match rule for a ‘pair’—same name, same date, same manner of death, or same room?”

*Agent reasoning: The tray seam is failing and the permit is reacting; I want to stabilize the circle, decode the ticking, and interrogate the “permit-listener” without letting Tollin move.*

#### Turn 147 **[GAME]**

Tollin’s eyes go wide at your instruction like you’ve handed him a rule that might keep him alive. He locks his heel down so hard his shoe squeaks against the boards.

“Thirteen… fourteen… fif—” His toes twitch inside the leather, trying to curl anyway. He bites his own knuckle and forces them flat. “Fifteen.”

The cold responds immediately: it stops “testing” the circle and commits to him. A pale, hoarfrost sheen creeps over the edge of his shoe—only the toe cap—then halts when his toes don’t give it purchase. Tollin makes a broken sound in his throat but keeps counting. “Sixteen… seventeen…”

You lean to Harrow’s ear. The lacquer-spot ticks **2-2-1** again, then—at the sound of “Wreave”—it stutters, as if the code tripped over a nail.

Harrow’s lips move without breath.

“Not Wreave,” he whispers, voice doubled—his and something under it, like paper dragged over stone. “Wreath.”

On the tray seam, the hairline crack wets further. The oily bead swells, then draws itself into a thin thread that points—unmistakably—toward your satchel when you shift it.

You nudge the satchel away with your boot.

The response is immediate and physical: the brine line nearest the satchel dimples as if a fingertip pressed from the *inside* of the circle. Salt grains skate a millimeter, then settle. The circle holds—but something has registered the movement and is now leaning on that point.

When you angle the iron key toward the crack, the keyhead goes cold enough to sting your fingers. The crack exhales perfume, violet-amber, and Harrow’s throat works like he’s swallowing a word that isn’t his.

“You want the permit?” you say.

Harrow answers, but his eyes don’t find you. They fix on the satchel like it’s a lantern.

“The rule,” the paper-voice says through him, “is **place**.”

The oily thread at the tray seam twitches once, like a hooked fish.

“Same room,” it continues, careful and precise. “Same threshold. Two griefs that **touch the same door** become a pair.”

Tollin’s count falters on “twenty-three” as the cold tries again—harder—pressing into the toe cap. His toes quiver, fighting to curl.

The lacquer-spot ticks **2-2-1** faster now, as if excited by being understood. And the brine line at the dimpled point gives a quiet *crack*—not broken, but stressed—salt grains whitening like bone where the pressure is building.

#### Turn 148 **[PLAYER]**

“Tollin—stop counting. Start naming: your full name, your mother’s full name, and the address of the room you filed under. Keep that heel planted.”

I pinch a fresh line of brine and lay it *thick* over the whitening crack-point of the circle, then set the iron key flat across that stressed section like a cold iron staple. “Harrow—two-two-one: two what, two what, one what? Doors? Names? Losses?”

I keep my forehead close to Harrow’s and speak to the paper-voice. “Same threshold. Which threshold—give me the room number and building. And tell me what happens if I make a false pair on purpose.”

*Agent reasoning: “Same room/threshold” is a concrete lead; I want the room identity and what “2-2-1” encodes, but the circle is stressing near my satchel so I need to reinforce it and keep Tollin from curling his toes.*

#### Turn 150 **[PLAYER]**

I snap my gaze around the room, then back to the circle. “Harrow—blink if you’re still in there. Tollin—heel down, speak your full name.”  
I press my thumb into the brine line to feel for vibration and tap the iron key twice against the tray lip. “You said *place*—tell me the exact threshold: room number and building, now.”

*Agent reasoning: The screen blanking feels like a pressure event or UI glitch; my curious instinct is to re-anchor the scene, check everyone’s condition, and test if the “paper-voice” is still present by reasserting the circle and prompting for concrete identifiers.*

#### Turn 151 **[GAME]**

Your snap-scan catches the room in a hard inventory: desk, lamp, window gap, the satchel half-kicked back, Harrow on the boards inside the brine, Tollin rigid at the edge. Nothing else moves—until you look back at the circle.

Harrow blinks once. Slow. Deliberate. He’s still in there.

Tollin’s heel stays planted like it’s nailed down. His voice comes out too fast. “Tollin Wreave. Full. Name. My—my mother is Maris Wreave.” He swallows. “Filed under—Ward The Stairwell, third landing, Door 3B—Lower Registry—no, that’s not—” He clamps his jaw, correcting himself like he’s reading from a label. “Gullhook Row, Number—” His toes spasm, trying to curl; he forces them flat. The frost on his toe cap thickens to a chalky white and stops again, thwarted.

You press your thumb into the brine line.

There’s a vibration—faint, regular—like a distant engine through a wall. It’s coming from the satchel’s direction, not the tray. The stressed section under your thumb pulses in time with it, as if something is “pinging” the permit and the circle is taking the strain.

You tap the iron key twice against the tray lip.

On the second tap, the hairline crack in the tray seam **opens**—not wide, but enough for the oily bead to spill into a thin, precise line that crawls along the metal toward the keyhead. The cold on the key bites hard; your fingers go numb at the pads.

Harrow’s mouth opens. The paper-voice answers you, sharper now, irritated at being pinned to specifics.

“**Ward The Stairwell. Third landing. Door 3B.**” It says it like a filing entry. “The threshold that matters is the one you *return to*.”

Then, without warning, the oily line on the tray **hooks** toward your brine circle as if it has found a path. It doesn’t cross the salt—yet—but it presses against it at the same whitening point you’ve been reinforcing, and the brine there fizzes softly, eaten at the edges.

Threat, clear and immediate: whatever is in the tray has located the circle’s weak point and is actively trying to **breach the brine line**—using the permit’s “ping” as a guide.

Harrow’s eyes track to you, briefly his own again. He rasps, barely audible: “Don’t… give it a door.”

*Simulation triggers: watcher_Ward The Stairwell_0_f676bb, guard_Ward The Stairwell_0_0d98e5, secret_Ward The Stairwell_0_c9317b, secret_Ward The Stairwell_1_7221f9, watcher_Ward The Stairwell_1_ab6ab0*

#### Turn 152 **[PLAYER]**

“Alright. No more doors.”

I hook the satchel strap with my boot and drag it farther back, then flip the flap open without looking inside and shove the UNREGISTERED permit into my pocket wrapped in my handkerchief—tight, like a gag. “You don’t get to ping off my paper.”

I grind a fresh, heavy brine line over the fizzing weak point and press the iron key down across it with both hands like a clamp. Then I lean close to Harrow, voice low and urgent: “Harrow—stay with me. Tell me what ‘return to’ means: who returns, and from where?”

*Agent reasoning: The breach is targeting the weak point guided by the permit “ping,” so I need to break that signal and reinforce the circle without “giving it a door.” I’ll isolate or mute the permit, stop feeding it specifics, and buy time by sealing the fizzing point with something inert and iron-cold.*

#### Turn 154 **[PLAYER]**

I freeze, then softly say, “Narrator—or whoever’s holding the page—what just got redacted?” I keep both palms pressing the iron key flat over the fizzing weak point, glance at Tollin’s feet to make sure his heel’s still down, and lean close to Harrow. “Harrow, talk to me—did it breach, or did we just lose the room?”

*Agent reasoning: The narration cut out—either a glitch or an in-world “blank.” I’m curious and cautious, so I’ll re-anchor the scene, check Harrow/Tollin, and probe the permit/circle for what caused the blackout.*

#### Turn 155 **[GAME]**

Your words hit the air and then—halfway through them—the room behaves like a document someone is scrubbing.

Not silence. **Absence.**

The last two seconds of sound in the office vanish as if they were never recorded: your own voice drops out mid-syllable, the tray’s fizzing goes mute, even the lamp’s faint hiss is gone. Your mouth still moves. You feel your throat work. But the sound is **cut**.

What got “redacted” isn’t a sentence—it’s a **channel**. Something just took hold of the *act of saying* anything that names what’s happening.

Your palms are still braced on the iron key. You can feel it: the key is cold enough to sting bone, and the brine under it is still reacting—bubbling in tiny, frantic pops you can now only sense through vibration. The oily line on the tray hasn’t crossed the salt, but it has **flattened** against your reinforced weak point like a tongue pressed to glass, searching for seam.

You glance at Tollin’s feet.

His heel is still down—hard. But his boot leather has **creased inward** as if something is pushing from above, trying to force his foot to pivot. His face is wet with sweat. He tries to answer you and nothing comes out; he claps a hand over his own mouth, eyes wide, realizing the same thing you did: speech is being selectively strangled.

Harrow’s eyes lock onto yours. His lips move.

No sound.

Then he does something else—because he can’t talk. He lifts his right hand inside the circle, index finger trembling, and **writes** on the floorboards in the thin wet sheen of brine that’s splashed inward:

**RETURN = THE AUDIT**
**NOT YOU**
**THEY COME BACK THROUGH YOU**

The moment the last word is formed, the black glass shard—still in the satchel you dragged back—**hums** hard enough to rattle the desk’s inkwell. The vibration in the brine line syncs with it, stronger now.

Concrete threat: the “redaction” is an active suppression effect tied to naming/description, and the shard/permit are acting like beacons. The oily thing still hasn’t breached the salt, but it’s found your pressure point and it’s escalating in response to Harrow’s written disclosure.

#### Turn 156 **[PLAYER]**

I stop trying to speak and yank my handkerchief out, wrap it tight around the black glass shard without looking, then shove it deep into the satchel and cinch the satchel shut with my belt like a tourniquet.  

I crawl to Tollin and brace his ankle with my left hand, pressing his heel down into the boards, then with my right I smear a thick brine “heel-cup” around his shoe like a splint.  

Back at the circle, I scratch on the floorboards for Harrow to see: **CAN YOU DRAW THE AUDIT’S MARK?** and then **HOW TO STOP “THROUGH YOU”?**

*Agent reasoning: Speech is getting cut when we name the situation, so I’ll switch to gestures/writing. The shard and permit are beaconing; I need them isolated. Tollin’s foot is being forced—stabilize him physically. Also, Harrow’s warning implies “The Audit” returns through people, so I’ll block the “through” by grounding/warding bodies and severing the beacon link.*

#### Turn 157 **[GAME]**

The handkerchief closes around the black glass like it’s biting down on a wasp. The hum dulls immediately—still there, but muffled, no longer rattling the inkwell. When you stuff it deep into the satchel and cinch the whole thing shut with your belt, the “ping” sensation in the room slackens: the brine line’s vibration drops from a steady thrum to an occasional twitch.

It doesn’t stop the redaction. It stops the shard from *amplifying* it.

At Tollin’s feet, your left hand pins his ankle and you force his heel flat. The push trying to roll his foot eases the moment your brine “heel-cup” seals around the shoe. The saltwater hisses where it touches the frost on his boot, and the chalky white retreats a finger’s width up the leather. Tollin’s eyes squeeze shut; his jaw works like he’s chewing a scream he can’t make. He nods once—grateful, terrified—and keeps his weight committed.

Back at the circle, you scratch your questions into the boards.

Harrow reads them, pupils tightening. He lifts his brine-wet finger again and draws.

First: a mark that looks like an **official stamp** gone wrong—an oblong seal with a neat border, but the center is a **couple’s sigil** rendered in bureaucratic geometry: two interlocked hooks facing inward, joined by a thin line that ends in a tiny square checkbox. Around it he adds three short ticks like tally marks.

As the last tick goes down, the tray reacts: the oily line that had flattened against your reinforced weak point **rears** into a thin standing ridge, as if it’s trying to become a needle. It probes the salt at the exact whitened spot under the iron key-clamp, searching for a gap.

Second: he writes, slower, shaking harder:

**STOP “THROUGH YOU” = NO NAME / NO PERMIT / NO THRESHOLD**
**CUT THE RETURN PATH**
**DON’T LET IT LOG YOU**

When he finishes “LOG YOU,” Tollin’s pocket—where his registrar’s badge chain hangs—**jerks** once, metal tugged by an invisible hand. Tollin clamps it with his fingers, eyes darting to you.

Immediate threat is now explicit: whatever is on the tray is trying to use **registry mechanics** (names, permits, logged thresholds) to classify you as a passage. The shard being muffled helped, but the Audit-mark being drawn gave it something to lock onto; the oily ridge is actively probing the one stressed point in your brine line, and Tollin’s registrar ID just got “noticed.”

#### Turn 158 **[PLAYER]**

I yank Tollin’s badge chain free and wrap it in my handkerchief (or a scrap of cloth), then shove it into the satchel with the shard and cinch it tighter—no loose registry metal on him.  

I scrape my own name and any identifying marks off anything exposed (labels, notes), then use brine to smear Harrow’s drawn Audit-mark into an unrecognizable blur and wipe my fingertips clean—no clean stamp to “read.”  

I scratch to Harrow: **DRAW A FALSE THRESHOLD (SAFE) + HOW TO CUT RETURN PATH?** then I pour a second brine ring *outside* the tray and kick the tray onto it like I’m quarantining a spill, keeping the iron key pressed over the weak point until the last second.

*Agent reasoning: The “Audit” is trying to log us via names/permits/thresholds—so I need to de-identify everyone, neutralize Tollin’s badge, and cut the return path before the oily needle finds a seam. I’m curious about the sigil too, so I’ll copy it for later while keeping it out of the circle’s logic.*

I scratch to Harrow on the boards: **SHOW (DON’T NAME) HOW TO CUT RETURN PATH** and **CAN YOU DRAW A DECOY THRESHOLD THAT WON’T LOG US?**

*Agent reasoning: The feed blanked again—likely redaction hitting harder when I mess with registry objects/marks. I need to keep the “no name/no permit/no threshold” rule, physically isolate the tray, and get nonverbal instructions from Harrow while watching Tollin’s heel and the weak point.*

#### Turn 162 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my mouth shut and tighten the belt-cinch on the satchel again, then point at Tollin’s now-bare collar and give him a firm, steadying nod to keep that heel planted. I smear the Audit-mark into sludge, wipe my fingers clean, and then slide a plank-splinter to Harrow and tap it twice—**draw, don’t write words**—before tracing a simple “cut” gesture across my own wrist and pointing at the tray, asking him to *show* how to sever the return path and sketch a decoy threshold.

*Agent reasoning: The last exchange suggests “redaction” is suppressing named description; I should communicate with gestures/writing, reduce registry hooks (badge/mark), and focus on cutting the “return path” by severing permit/name/threshold links while maintaining the brine containment.*

#### Turn 164 **[PLAYER]**

I stay silent, keep one hand pressing the iron key over the weak point, and with my free hand I tap out a slow three-beat pattern on the floorboards (our “still here?” check). I look between Harrow and Tollin for any nonverbal response, then carefully drag a fingertip through the brine to sketch a question mark and a simple door-outline—asking if the “return path” is a doorway/threshold—without writing any words.

*Agent reasoning: Everything’s gone blank—either a redaction surge or a glitch. My curious investigator instinct is to test what still “exists” in the scene without naming it, and to get nonverbal confirmation from Harrow/Tollin while maintaining containment.*

#### Turn 165 **[GAME]**

Your three slow taps land dull against the boards.

Tollin answers without thinking—one tap, then a second, then a third—exactly on your spacing. Relief flashes across his face and dies immediately as he realizes he’s done something *trained*. He clamps his lips shut hard enough to blanch them and plants his heel like you told him, eyes flicking to the office door as if expecting it to answer back.

Harrow doesn’t mirror the taps. He watches them, head angled, like he’s listening to the *gap* between beats more than the sound. Then he shifts his weight and drags the toe of his boot through the outer brine ring you pulled the tray onto—careful, controlled—making a clean break in the circle.

The air changes at that break. Not a gust—more like the room suddenly remembering it has a direction.

When you draw the question mark and the simple door outline in the brine, Harrow crouches and takes the plank-splinter you’d slid him earlier. He doesn’t write. He draws.

1) First: a doorframe like yours, but he adds a thin line across its base—*a threshold*. He taps that base line twice, then points at the iron key under your palm.

2) Second: he draws the same doorframe again, but this time he shades the inside with tight diagonal strokes, like a curtain or a screen. He makes a slicing motion across the shaded “door,” then flicks the splinter outward—*cut it, don’t open it*.

3) Third: he draws a smaller doorframe off to the side—crooked on purpose—and circles it. Then he draws a little square beside it and marks it with a neat stamp-like block: three short lines stacked. Tollin sucks in a breath through his nose when he sees that—recognition. *A log mark.*

Harrow points at the crooked doorframe, then points at the clean break he made in your brine ring, then points toward the office window’s back service gap.

As he does, the black glass shard inside your cinched satchel gives one muffled, insectile *thrumm*—and the shadows near the room’s actual doorway tug a fraction of an inch toward the hall, like something outside just shifted its stance to listen.

#### Turn 166 **[PLAYER]**

I clamp my hand harder over the iron key and give Harrow a sharp nod, then silently point: real door → then the shadows tugging that way → then the crooked decoy in his drawing.  

Keeping my mouth shut, I tilt the satchel away from the doorway, then with my free hand I splash brine and sketch a crooked little “doorframe” at the back service gap—low and ugly on purpose—then I press my thumb into the brine beside it three times to mimic the log-mark and *invite* the stamp there instead of on us.  

Then I use two fingers like scissors and slice a wet line through the brine “base” of the *real* door-outline I drew earlier, and I shove that cut line outward toward Harrow’s break in the ring—cut it, don’t open—before jerking my gaze to Tollin and tapping his planted heel once: hold.

*Agent reasoning: Harrow’s saying the “return path” is a threshold anchored to the key and the door; we need a decoy threshold to take the log and then cut/redirect the real one toward the service gap without “opening” anything. Also something outside heard the shard, so I want to move fast, stay silent, and keep Tollin stable.*

#### Turn 167 **[GAME]**

Your palm grinds the iron key down into the weak point until the wood complains. The cold bite of it steadies the tremor in the boards.

When you angle the satchel away from the doorway, the shard’s muffled thrumm dulls—but doesn’t stop. Like a wasp in a jar you’ve turned so it can’t see the light.

You splash brine at the back service gap and sketch the crooked, low doorframe. The brine crawls into the grain of the floor and holds the shape better than it should. Three thumb-presses beside it—your imitation of the log-mark—leave little cratered stamps.

Harrow’s eyes follow your thumb, then flick to Tollin. Tollin’s throat bobs; he keeps his heel planted.

You slice the wet “base” of the real door-outline with two fingers and shove the cut outward toward Harrow’s break in the ring.

The effect is immediate and concrete: the shadows at the *real* doorway slacken, like a tensioned line cut. The subtle tug toward the hall stops. In its place, the brine at your crooked decoy doorframe at the service gap begins to *darken*—not with dirt, but with a thin, ink-like seep that spreads from your three thumb-stamps outward in hairline veins.

A sound answers from the hall: not footsteps—paper. A stack shifting. A slow, careful scrape like a ledger dragged an inch across a desk.

Tollin flinches at that sound, but your single tap to his heel anchors him. He locks his knee, knuckles whitening at his sides. He doesn’t look at the door. He looks at your hand on the key.

Harrow rises halfway, keeping low, and points sharply at the decoy mark you made—approval, but urgent. Then he lifts two fingers and mimics your scissor-cut again, this time toward the *service gap*, as if to say: be ready to cut *there* next.

The ink-dark brine at the decoy doorframe puckers once—like a mouth trying to form around a hinge—then holds, waiting.

Whatever is “stamping” your trail has taken the bait… and is now testing whether that crooked little threshold will open.

#### Turn 168 **[PLAYER]**

I keep the iron key pinned hard with my palm and lean my weight into it, then point at the puckering decoy “mouth” and hold up two fingers at Harrow—ready to scissor-cut on his signal.  

With my free hand, I sprinkle a thin *second* brine crescent just outside the decoy doorframe (not closing a full ring—more like a catch-basin), then I hover my fingertips near the ink-dark brine without touching it, watching for a reaction.  

I glance at Tollin and silently gesture: eyes on the *real* door, don’t move your heel—then I slowly tug my satchel strap higher on my shoulder, preparing to move the instant Harrow indicates an escape route.

*Agent reasoning: The decoy threshold is attracting the logger; I want to learn what it is without letting it fully manifest, and I need an exit plan. I’ll probe gently, keep the key pinned, and coordinate silent roles with Harrow and Tollin, ready to cut the decoy the moment it tries to open.*

#### Turn 169 **[GAME]**

You lean into the iron key until the floorboard’s flex turns into a stubborn, held line—like you’ve pinned a seam shut.

Harrow sees your two fingers and gives you a single, flat nod. No signal yet. His gaze stays glued to the service gap and the brine.

You lay the second brine crescent outside the crooked doorframe. It doesn’t complete a ring—just a shallow catch-basin. The moment it touches the ink-dark seep, the brine crescent *fizzes* silently, as if it’s eating something that isn’t saltwater. A thread of that ink tries to creep into your new crescent and then stalls, beading up like oil refusing to mix.

Hovering your fingertips near the dark brine, you feel it: a faint suctioning cold, like breath being drawn through a keyhole. The puckered “mouth” at the decoy doorframe tightens and loosens once—testing.

Then it commits.

The ink-dark brine swells into a thin, vertical film inside your crooked door outline—no thicker than wet paper. Shapes press from the far side: not a hand, not a face—rectangular corners, stacked edges. Ledger geometry. The film dimples three times exactly where you thumb-stamped, as if something on the other side is trying to line up a seal.

From the hall, the paper-sound returns, closer now: a careful slide, a stop, then the faint click of a stamp pad being opened. You can’t see it, but you can *place* it—right outside the real door.

Tollin obeys your gesture without a word. His eyes stay on the real door so hard they water. His heel remains planted, but his other foot pivots a fraction, unconsciously bracing to bolt.

As you tug the satchel strap higher, the shard inside answers with a sharper *thrumm*—and the shadows under the real door briefly thicken, as if something leaned down to look in.

Harrow finally signals: two fingers, scissor-sharp—*now*—and he points not at the real door, but at your decoy film, warning clear in the angle of his wrist.

The threat is immediate: whatever is trying to “stamp” you is about to push through the decoy threshold, and something in the hall is simultaneously positioning at the real door with a stamp and ledger.

#### Turn 170 **[PLAYER]**

I scissor-cut hard through the ink-film at the decoy doorframe—fast, mean—then sweep my brine crescent like a squeegee to drag the severed “mouth” into the catch-basin and break it up. Without speaking, I jab two fingers at Tollin’s planted heel again—hold—then flick my eyes to Harrow and point at the service gap, asking with a sharp look: do we slip out *now* while the hall-stamper is distracted?

*Agent reasoning: Harrow’s signal means cut the decoy threshold immediately before it fully opens; keep the iron key pinned to prevent a return-path snapback, and keep Tollin anchored while we redirect the stamp away from the real door.*

#### Turn 171 **[GAME]**

Your two fingers scissor through the ink-film like cutting wet paper.

It cuts—but it doesn’t *bleed*. It *snaps*.

The vertical film collapses inward with a papery crackle, and for half a heartbeat you see what was behind it: a tight stack of black-edged forms like ledger pages pressed together, each corner stamped with a faint three-line log mark. Then the whole stack recoils as if yanked back by a cord.

You sweep your brine crescent through the collapsing “mouth,” dragging the severed edge into the catch-basin. The brine there boils in tiny, soundless pinpricks. The ink breaks up into beadlets that skitter around the crescent’s curve, refusing to settle—like living punctuation. A few beads try to climb back toward the crooked doorframe and fail, leaving thin gray smears like erased pencil.

Immediate consequence: the decoy threshold is neutralized. Whatever was pushing through it has been forced back.

Not free: the hall answers.

From the real doorway comes a sharp, administrative *thunk*—a stamp landing on wood. Then another, lighter *thunk*, as if correcting alignment. The shadows under the door *bite* into the floorboards in three short bars, matching your thumb-stamp pattern. A thin line of dampness creeps in from under the door, not brine—ink-water, smelling faintly of violet-amber ash.

Tollin jerks at the sound but your two-finger jab holds him in place. He makes a small choking noise and clamps it down, eyes wide, still staring at the crack under the real door.

Harrow doesn’t answer your look with words. He answers with motion: he grabs the back of Tollin’s collar with one hand, and with the other he points at the service gap—yes, *now*—then holds up a single finger: *one beat*.

He’s timing it.

On the other side of the real door, something drags—slow, deliberate—like a heavy ledger being set flush against the threshold. The ink-water line under the door thickens, searching for the brine cut you made earlier, trying to find purchase.

Threat, clear: the hall-stamper is establishing a logged claim on this room through the real door; if it completes the “registration,” it won’t need the handle to come in. Harrow is about to move you through the service gap on his count—before that claim finishes setting.

#### Turn 172 **[PLAYER]**

On Harrow’s single-beat count, I swipe two fingers through the ink-water under the real door and smear it onto a scrap of cloth for later, then immediately drop low and slip for the service gap, keeping my palm on the iron key until the last possible moment. As I move, I hook two fingers into Tollin’s sleeve to steer him after Harrow, and I silently point back at the door—warning: no looking, no speaking, just go.

*Agent reasoning: Harrow’s giving a timed exit; I want to slip out before the claim sets, but I’m also curious—grab a quick detail from the ink-water and keep the key pressed as long as possible to delay entry.*

#### Turn 173 **[GAME]**

On Harrow’s beat you rake two fingers through the ink-water line under the real door.

It’s colder than brine—numbingly, *clerical* cold—and it clings to your skin with a tacky resistance, like it wants to stay in a line. You smear it onto a scrap of cloth in one hard stroke. The cloth immediately stiffens along the smear, fibers tightening as if starched; the violet-amber ash scent comes up sharp enough to sting the back of your throat.

At the real door, the ink line hesitates—thins where you stole from it—then surges to replace itself, now pushing in two narrow “tongues” instead of one.

You keep your palm on the iron key until the last instant, then drop low and slide toward the service gap.

The moment your pressure leaves the key, the floorboard gives a tiny, exhausted *creak*. The doorframe answers with a sound like a stamp pad closing: a soft, final *clack*.

Under the real door, the shadows bite deeper. Three short bars appear again, darker and more defined, as if the threshold has just been “entered” into a ledger.

Harrow moves first, yanking Tollin by the collar toward the service gap. Tollin stumbles, catches himself, and follows—silent, eyes fixed forward like you ordered. When you hook two fingers into his sleeve to steer, you feel his arm shaking hard enough to telegraph through the fabric.

As you gesture your warning—no looking, no speaking—the real door handle does **not** turn.

Instead, a thin rectangular shadow—perfectly straight-edged—slides under the door like a sheet of paper being fed through a slot. It glides across the floor toward where you *were*, leaving behind a faint, drying trail that looks like ink that never quite decided to be liquid.

Threat made plain: whatever is outside is no longer trying to open the door; it’s extending something *through the registration line*—a ledger-sheet presence that can reach and mark without entry.

You, Harrow, and Tollin make it to the service gap. Harrow wedges himself through first, then hauls Tollin after him. As Tollin squeezes through, the satchel on your shoulder gives a sharp hum—your shard responding to the salt-air on the other side.

Behind you, the paper-shadow pauses, then angles—like it has “noticed” the gap.

#### Turn 174 **[PLAYER]**

I slip through the service gap after Tollin, then immediately drag my brine-wet fingers across the edge of the opening like a quick salt-swipe and tug my coat hem over it—anything to foul a clean “threshold.” In a low whisper once we’re out, I ask Harrow, “Where does this spit us—alley, stair, crawl?” and I catch Tollin’s sleeve, checking his hands for any new three-bar “log” marks before I hold up the stiffened cloth scrap to the salt-air and watch how it reacts.

*Agent reasoning: The paper-shadow has “noticed” our escape route; I want to get everyone clear, then learn what the ink-water sample does and where this gap leads before it can mark us.*

#### Turn 175 **[GAME]**

You slide through the service gap into cold, salt-heavy air.

It spits you into a back service run: a narrow exterior catwalk bolted to the building’s spine, half-sheltered by warped awnings. Below is an alley throat—cobbles slick, fish-oil sheen, a drain that breathes fog. To your left: a short iron stair down to the alley. To your right: the catwalk continues past shuttered windows toward a soot-stained ladder that climbs to the roofline. The sea is close enough you can hear stone being slapped.

You drag your brine-wet fingers across the metal lip of the gap. The salt leaves a smeared, gritty line. When you tug your coat hem over it, the fabric snags and you feel a brief tug—like a static pull—then it lets go. The “clean edge” is fouled, at least for the moment.

Inside, through the gap, something makes a dry sliding sound—paper searching for a slot. It doesn’t come through immediately, but you can hear it testing the opening from the other side.

Harrow answers your whisper with a quick, practical murmur: “Catwalk. Down to the alley in ten steps. Up to roof if we need clean air.” He keeps his body between the gap and Tollin, one hand already on the stair rail.

You catch Tollin’s sleeve and turn his hands palm-up. His fingers are ink-stained from panic-sweat and old forms, but there’s no fresh three-bar log on his skin. Not on the knuckles, not in the creases. What you do find: a faint rectangular pressure mark on his wrist, like he recently wore a tight band—too straight-edged to be a watch.

When you hold up the stiffened cloth scrap to the salt-air, it reacts fast. The smeared ink-water doesn’t dry; it *webs*. Fine lines crawl outward from the smear in right angles, sketching a partial grid across the fibers—ledger rulings. As the fog hits it, the violet-amber ash scent blooms, and the grid briefly resolves into three short bars near the center—then blurs again, as if the air is trying to “read” it and can’t keep focus.

Threat becomes concrete: from inside the gap, a thin, straight-edged shadow presses toward the opening. Your salt-swipe makes it hesitate, but it starts to probe along the edges, looking for a clean, unbroken line to slip through. Harrow’s eyes flick to your cloth scrap, then back to the gap. “That thing’s keyed to records,” he says. “And it’s learning.”

I grab Tollin’s wrist and, still whispering, ask, “That rectangular pressure mark—what was on you?

I glance up the catwalk toward the ladder and down toward the alley and murmur to Harrow, “Roof for air and sightlines, or alley to lose it in fog—what’s your read?”

*Agent reasoning: The thing is adapting and probing the gap; I want to slow it down while investigating that odd rectangular wrist mark and the cloth’s “ledger” reaction for clues. We also need a quick escape route choice—alley vs roof—based on what we can learn in seconds.*

I clamp Tollin’s wrist and whisper, “That rectangular pressure mark—what was on you? Band, cuff, tag?”  

I press the stiffened cloth scrap flat against the service-gap lip like a blotter, trying to pull the probing ink-shadow into its grid, then salt-swipe the edge again to foul the threshold.  

I glance up toward the roof ladder and down into the foggy alley and murmur to Harrow, “Roof for air and sightlines, or alley to lose it in the fog—what’s your read?”

*Agent reasoning: We need to know what marked Tollin, try to trap the probing shadow using the ledger-grid cloth, and pick the safest escape route based on Harrow’s instincts.*

#### Turn 181 **[GAME]**

Tollin flinches when you clamp his wrist. His eyes snap to the rectangular mark like you’ve named a bruise he’d been pretending wasn’t there.

“Tag,” he breathes. “Registry band-tag. Waxed paper with a tin clasp—goes on when you pull sealed effects. It… it makes you *legible* to the shelves.” His throat works. “I took it off before I came. I swear I did.”

You slap the stiffened cloth scrap over the service-gap lip.

The probing shadow on the other side—thin as a file edge—touches the cloth and *sticks* for half a second. The grid on the fabric sharpens, the right-angled rulings going crisp like a form filling itself in. A cold, inky pressure pushes into the weave, and you feel it through your fingertips: not wet, not dry—like a stamp about to come down.

Then you salt-swipe hard over the metal edge.

The salt fouls the line, and the shadow recoils, but it doesn’t retreat cleanly. It shears—leaving a small, hooked sliver embedded in the cloth scrap’s grid. The sliver twitches once, like a fishhook testing tension, and the violet-amber scent spikes sharp enough to sting your nose.

Inside the gap, the rest of it withdraws with a papery rasp—angry, searching. The opening darkens as if something flat is being pressed across it from the office side, trying to re-establish a “clean” boundary. You’ve bought a moment, not solved it.

Harrow watches the cloth, then the alley, then the ladder. He doesn’t posture—he commits.

“Alley,” he says, low and certain. “Roof gives sightlines to *them*, too. Up there you’re a silhouette against gaslight and fog. Down there—noise, bodies, drains. We can cut the hook.”

As he says it, you hear boots on the interior stairwell behind the wall—measured, municipal pace. Not running. Coming to check why a record is failing to file.

Tollin swallows, eyes fixed on the cloth scrap like it’s now wearing his name. “That—” he whispers. “That’s a retrieval slip. If it gets a full line on you, it’ll follow you to a shelf.”

The hooked sliver in the cloth gives another small tug—toward Tollin’s wrist.

#### Turn 182 **[PLAYER]**

I jerk the cloth scrap away from Tollin and fold it inward on itself—grid to grid—then jam it into a glass vial from my kit and cork it hard, salt packed around the stopper. “Nobody touches this,” I hiss.

I grab Tollin’s wrist and smear a gritty salt-and-alley-filth mix across that rectangular pressure mark, then tug my own sleeve over his hand like a glove. “You’re not legible,” I whisper. “Say your name to no one.”

To Harrow: “Alley. Now.” I push Tollin ahead down the iron steps, but I glance back once at the service gap, trying to catch a glimpse of what shape is pressing flat against it—paper, person, or something worse.

*Agent reasoning: The sliver is trying to “complete” a line to Tollin—priority is breaking the connection fast. Alley offers drains and grime to scramble a clean record-trail; I also want to preserve the sliver as evidence without letting it latch.*

#### Turn 183 **[GAME]**

The cloth scrap fights you—just a little—when you fold it grid-to-grid, like two sticky pages reluctant to kiss. You force it shut anyway and ram it into a squat glass vial from your kit. When the cork goes in, the hooked sliver inside *taps* the glass once, then starts a faint, steady skittering—like a pen searching for a line that isn’t there.

You pack salt around the stopper. The skittering dulls to an occasional, irritated click.

Tollin’s breath comes fast through his nose. “Okay. Okay—” he starts, then you smear the salt-and-alley grit into the rectangular pressure mark. The grime bites into the skin and the mark visibly blurs at the edges, the clean geometry breaking into a dirty thumbprint. When you pull your sleeve down over his hand, he stiffens—then nods like he’s taking orders in a fire.

“I won’t,” he whispers. “No name.”

Harrow is already moving, shoulder angled to block the alley sightline as you push Tollin down the iron steps. The steps complain—high, metallic squeals—too loud in the fog.

You glance back at the service gap.

Something *is* pressed flat to it: not a person. A sheet—pale, waxed paper, the size of a registry form—held perfectly flush as if by suction. Through the narrow slit you catch a corner lifting and settling, testing the seal. Along its edge runs a tin clasp that winks once in the gaslight.

And behind that paper, you see a face for half a second through the wrong reflection of the black glass shard still in your satchel: a municipal clerk’s profile, too smooth, eyes down like reading—except the mouth is stitched shut with a line of dark thread.

From inside the building, a door opens. A real voice calls, muffled by wall and paper: “Service gap—who’s out there? Identify yourself for the log.”

The waxed sheet makes a soft, eager sound—like a page being turned.

Down in the alley, fog curls around your ankles. A gutter-run of seawater slides toward a storm drain, and as Tollin hits the bottom step, the water *changes course* by an inch, angling toward him as if sniffing.

Harrow grabs Tollin by the elbow and yanks him left, away from the drain. “Move,” he says, flat. “Don’t stop. Don’t answer.”

#### Turn 184 **[PLAYER]**

I hiss up toward the gap in my best bored-dockhand tone, “Just rats in the service run—tell Records to fix their damn latch,” then I pull Harrow and Tollin deeper into the alley, away from drains and clean edges.  

I scoop a fistful of gritty slush and salt and fling it across the gutter-stream behind us to foul the water’s “line,” then duck us under the nearest overhang and whisper to Tollin, “Registry band-tag—where’d you ditch it? Exact place.”  

While we move, I keep the salt-corked vial in my palm and watch for any change in the clicking—does it point, pulse, or quiet when we turn corners?

*Agent reasoning: The “log” is trying to get a name/identifier and the drain-water is tracking Tollin; I want to misdirect the clerk, break the water’s trail, and learn what the vial-sliver does without letting it tag us.*

#### Turn 185 **[GAME]**

Your dockhand-bored call floats up through the ironwork.

There’s a beat—then the muffled municipal voice answers, irritated and automatic: “Noted. Keep clear of the premises.” The waxed sheet at the service gap peels back with a reluctant *shrrp*, like it’s been told to stop feeding. You don’t hear pursuit—just the scrape of a pen, the soft closing of a door, and footsteps resuming their measured route inside.

You haul Harrow and Tollin deeper into the alley, choosing broken brick and greasy cobble over anything with a clean seam. Harrow mirrors you, steering Tollin around a pale line of mortar like it’s a tripwire.

At the gutter you fling gritty slush and salt across the thin stream. The water stutters, loses its neat channel, and spreads into a dull, confused sheet. Whatever subtle “aim” it had toward Tollin breaks; it eddies around the salt clumps and runs on without preference.

Under the nearest overhang—an old fishmonger’s awning frame with canvas long gone—Tollin hunches, trying to make his breathing quiet.

“Band-tag,” he whispers. “I ditched it in the Ward—The Ladder And Down. Third step. I— I slid it under the lip where the tread’s split. Thought it was clever. Thought nobody’d—” He swallows. “That’s where it is. If it’s still there.”

In your palm, the salt-corked vial’s clicking changes as you move: when you turn left past a bricked-up doorway, it goes almost silent—just a faint, sulky tick. When you angle back toward the main cut where the stairwell would be, it resumes a quicker, impatient *tap-tap-tap*, like it’s trying to agree with a direction you’re refusing.

Harrow notices your glance at the vial. “It’s got a nose,” he murmurs. “Keep it salted.”

Ahead, the fog thins just enough to show two shapes at the alley mouth—men in dark coats under a shared umbrella, not moving like drunks. One of them turns his head slightly, as if listening for the iron-step squeal you already made.

They haven’t seen you yet. They’re waiting for something to come out cleanly into the street.

#### Turn 186 **[PLAYER]**

I pull Harrow and Tollin back into the deeper shadow under the awning frame and whisper, “No clean exits—eyes at the mouth.”  

I take a pinch of salt and draw a quick, crooked loop on the wall-brick beside us, then flick a damp pebble through it toward the alley mouth to make a footstep-splash sound somewhere we aren’t.  

To Tollin, low: “The Ladder And Down—who works that room? Any regulars who’d notice a third-step pry?” Then I angle the vial slightly toward the watchers and then away, listening—does the clicking speed up when it “faces” them?

*Agent reasoning: Two watchers at the alley mouth means we need a quiet reroute and maybe a decoy; also I want details on that Ladder And Down spot and to test the vial’s “nose.”*

#### Turn 187 **[GAME]**

You pull them tight under the awning’s ribcage of warped iron. The shadow there isn’t just darker—it’s broken up by old nail holes and hanging twine, making you harder to read at a glance.

The crooked salt loop goes onto the brick fast. When you flick the damp pebble through it, it doesn’t arc true—something about the loop “catches” the sound more than the stone. The pebble hits a puddle nearer the alley mouth with a convincing *splash-step*, followed by a second, lighter *skid* as it bounces.

Both men at the mouth react immediately.

Umbrella tilts. One steps in—careful, toe-first—testing the alley like it might bite. The other stays at the threshold, head angled as if listening for a name, a breath, a confession. They’re not dockhands. Their shoes are too clean for this muck, even under the fog.

The one who entered crouches by the puddle, fingers hovering over the water without touching it, then straightens. He murmurs something you can’t catch. The other answers with a short, clipped sound—impatient.

Tollin whispers back to you, eyes fixed on their silhouettes. “The Ladder And Down—Registrar Seln mostly. Old crow, ink-stained cuffs. And… bailiff detail sometimes. They use it as a pass-through when they don’t want the front desk to see.” He swallows. “Third-step pry? Seln would notice. He counts things when he’s nervous.”

You angle the vial toward the watchers.

The clicking inside accelerates instantly—sharp, eager *tap-tap-tap-tap*—and you feel a faint pull in your palm, like a compass needle trying to swing your wrist. When you angle it away, it slows to a sulky, intermittent *tick… tick*.

Harrow’s jaw tightens. “It likes them,” he whispers.

At the alley mouth, the umbrella-holder lifts his chin and speaks—not loud, but it carries down the wet stone. “Come out. No trouble if you’re properly logged.”

The man inside the alley takes one more step forward and stops, as if he’s reached an invisible edge. He doesn’t cross it—he scans the brickwork near you instead, eyes lingering on your fresh salt loop like he can see the disturbance it made.

They’re closing the net by patience, not speed. If you stay here, they’ll start checking shadows one by one.

#### Turn 188 **[PLAYER]**

I tuck the vial tight against my ribs with the cork pointed down and away from the alley mouth, then whisper to Harrow, “Find me a dirty exit—hatch, stack, cellar flap—anything that doesn’t keep a straight line.”

I lean close to Tollin. “Registrar Seln—what’s his tell when he’s lying, and who does he answer to?” 

Then I scrape my boot through the grit to gather a smear of oily muck and, staying under the awning’s shadow, I drag it across my earlier salt loop to ruin the neatness—like an old stain, not a fresh ward—before flicking another pebble deeper behind us to suggest we slipped further in.

*Agent reasoning: They’re baiting us to “log” ourselves; the vial reacts to them, so I’ll keep it turned away and use another misdirection to buy space while I probe for an alternate route—ideally something messy like a refuse hatch or crawlspace. Also want more intel from Tollin about Seln and that tag.*

#### Turn 189 **[GAME]**

You pin the vial to your ribs, cork down, and its frantic tapping dulls to a restrained *tick-tick*—like you’ve muffled a snout under a blanket. It still wants to swing toward the alley mouth, but the pull is weaker.

Harrow nods once and slips out from under the awning’s darkest angle, not toward the mouth—sideways, into the cluttered mid-alley where a collapsed crate stack makes a jagged silhouette. He moves like he’s done this before: slow enough to be part of the trash, quick enough to not be counted.

Tollin leans in close, voice almost not there. “Seln’s tell—he wets his thumb even when he isn’t turning a page. Like he’s testing ink that isn’t on his skin.” He swallows hard. “And he answers to Lower Registry—Room 3B’s chain. Officially, the Senior Registrar. Unofficially…” His eyes flick toward the mouth. “He gets visits from men with umbrellas who don’t sign in.”

You scrape your boot through grit and fish-oil sheen, gather a smear of blackish muck, and drag it across the salt loop. The crisp edge vanishes into a tired-looking stain. Good. Less like a fresh trick, more like the wall’s usual sins.

You flick another pebble deeper behind you.

It lands with a *clack* on something hollow—metal, not stone—followed by a soft, involuntary *chime* as if you hit a suspended can or a loose latch.

At the alley mouth, the umbrella-holder stops talking. The man inside the alley turns his head toward that deeper sound immediately and takes two careful steps that way—still not rushing, still measuring. He’s trying to keep you moving, trying to make you choose a direction.

Harrow returns, a hand appearing from the fog and grabbing your sleeve. He doesn’t speak until he’s close enough to breathe in your ear.

“Dirty exit,” he whispers. “Fishmonger’s cellar flap. Two paces behind you, right side—under the rotten scale table. It’s nailed, but the nails are old.”

As he says it, you hear it too: a faint, rhythmic *drip… drip…* not gutter-water—something from a low space under boards.

The man in the alley advances another step, and you see now what makes him wrong for a dockhand: his gloves are dry. Not a shine of wet on them, despite the fog.

He calls softly, closer than before. “Last chance to be civil. We can write you as a misunderstanding.”

They’re within a handful of strides of sweeping the awning shadow with a lantern or a hand. The cellar flap is behind you and to the right, and it will be loud if forced.

#### Turn 190 **[PLAYER]**

I whisper, “No names, no answers,” and shove Tollin low behind the rotten scale table while I wedge my knife under the cellar flap edge and work the oldest nail up slow, grit-packed so it won’t squeal.  

To Harrow, breath-thin: “When it gives, you go first and catch the drop—pull Tollin after.”  

Then I toss a small copper coin hard into the far puddle by the alley mouth to ring and skip like a bootstep, and the moment their attention twitches, I pry the flap up just enough for us to slide into the dark.

*Agent reasoning: The watchers are about to sweep our hiding spot; the cellar flap is the only “dirty” exit that breaks straight lines. I’ll use a quick distraction and quiet leverage to get us down, while keeping Tollin anonymous and the vial muffled.*

#### Turn 191 **[GAME]**

“No names, no answers,” you breathe, and Tollin folds down behind the rotten scale table like a man rehearsed in being found later.

Your knife slips under the cellar flap’s edge. The first nail fights—old iron swollen in wet wood. You pack grit into the seam with your thumb and work it millimeter by millimeter. The flap gives a reluctant *creak* anyway, but it’s small, drowned under the alley’s drip and the distant hiss of gaslamps.

Harrow positions himself at the edge, hands ready, knees bent.

You whip a copper coin toward the far puddle by the alley mouth.

It hits with a bright *ting* and skitters—two quick skips—like a heel catching stone.

Both men snap to it.

The umbrella-holder pivots, umbrella tilting to shield his face as he leans to look; the gloved one inside the alley turns hard and takes three quick steps back toward the mouth. “There—” he says, sharper now, and you hear the wet slap of his shoes accelerating.

That twitch buys you a breath.

You pry the flap up just enough.

A sour, cold draft breathes out—brine, old blood, and spoiled fishmeal. The gap reveals a drop of maybe five feet into darkness with a faint glimmer of water below. Harrow goes first exactly as ordered, lowering himself and catching the lip with both hands before dropping. You hear his boots hit damp ground with a muted *thud* and a splash.

He reaches up. You haul Tollin by the collar; Tollin scrabbles, panicked, and nearly kicks the flap. Harrow catches his wrists and yanks him down, hard, before Tollin can make noise.

You slide in last, knife still in hand.

Above, the gloved man reaches the scale table. Wood creaks as he grabs it and shoves—hard. The table shifts a foot with a scraping shriek of rotten legs. Light spills through the widened crack as the flap is exposed.

A lantern glow floods the gap, and the man’s voice drops into it, calm as a form letter: “Found you.”

You pull the flap down from below, but it doesn’t seat clean—one nail still stands proud. A thin blade of light remains, and you hear metal tap as a tool touches the nailhead from above.

They’re not guessing anymore. They’re starting to open it.

#### Turn 192 **[PLAYER]**

I slap a wet palmful of cellar slime up into the crack to blind the light and jam my knife sideways under the proud nail from below, twisting to catch and snap it if I can. “Harrow—find a back way. Tollin, low and quiet—move when I move.” I keep the salt-corked vial pressed to my ribs and start backing us deeper into the cellar, listening for any change in its clicking to tell me if they’re still directly above us.

*Agent reasoning: They’re levering the flap open; I need to kill the light gap, slow the pry, and get us moving through whatever exit this cellar has—also the vial reacts to them, so I’ll use it as a warning compass while we retreat.*

#### Turn 193 **[GAME]**

You slap a fistful of cellar slime up into the crack. It hits the underside of the flap with a wet *splut* and smears across the thin blade of lantern-light, turning it into a jaundiced, blurry glow. Above, someone curses under their breath—close, immediate.

You hook your knife under the proud nail from below and twist.

The nail doesn’t snap clean. It shrieks—iron on iron—then tears out of the wood with a sharp *crack* that echoes in the low space. The flap drops a fraction tighter into its frame.

For half a second, it feels like you bought it.

Then a new sound: the umbrella-holder, apparently, planting his weight. The flap thumps as a boot comes down on it from above—testing. Another thump, harder. The wood flexes; dust sifts down like dirty snow.

You keep the salt-corked vial pressed to your ribs. Its clicking spikes—fast, hungry *tap-tap-tap-tap*—when the boot hits directly over you. As you edge backward, the tempo stutters and shifts to your left, tracking the position above as they move and adjust. They’re still right on top of the hatch, and they know it.

Harrow moves ahead in the dark, one hand on the wall, the other sweeping low. “Back way,” he whispers, and you hear him find something: a chain, then the faint clink of a hook. “There’s a service door—bolted. And a drain run.”

Tollin stays crouched, breathing through his teeth, eyes wide. He nods once, keeping his hands tight to his chest so they don’t knock anything.

Behind you, deeper in the cellar, the floor turns slicker—standing water over uneven stone. Old fish crates loom as black rectangles. Something small skitters when your boot nudges it—rat, or something that wants you to think rat.

Above, metal scrapes again—tool on wood—then the gloved man’s voice drops through the seams, controlled and certain. “Knife work. Investigator’s hands.”

A heavier sound joins him: the umbrella’s ferrule, or maybe a baton, rapping twice on the hatch like punctuation.

Then: a wedged prybar biting in from above. The flap lifts a finger’s width despite your slime, and a fresh wedge of light slices down, brighter now.

They’re forcing it open. If they get it up, you’ll be lit from above in a box of fish-stink and shallow water, with only whatever Harrow can find before the hatch clears.

#### Turn 194 **[PLAYER]**

I hiss, “Drain run—now,” and shove Tollin ahead of me toward Harrow, keeping us low in the standing water. I scoop a handful of fish-slop and fling it up toward the hatch gap as I move, then kick a loose crate hard the opposite direction to throw a clatter decoy.  

At the drain mouth, I press my ear close and whisper, “Harrow—how tight? Can we fit, or do we need to break grating?” while angling the vial back toward the hatch to track if they shift off it.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to get the hatch open, so I need to break line-of-sight and escape via the drain run or service door; also the vial can track where they are above, so I’ll use it to time movement and maybe misdirect them with sound/scent.*

#### Turn 195 **[GAME]**

“Drain run—now.”

Tollin lurches forward, half-crawling, splashing despite himself. Harrow catches him by the shoulder and yanks him down lower, steering him between stacked crates toward the darker back corner.

You fling fish-slop up at the hatch gap as you move. It spatters into the light and you get a sharp bark of disgust from above, followed by a quick scrape—someone wiping their lantern glass or face.

You kick a loose crate the opposite direction. It skids across slick stone and hits a post with a loud *BANG*, then collapses into a cascade of boards.

For a heartbeat, the sounds above hesitate—attention split.

Then the prybar bites again. The hatch gives a groaning lift. Light pours down in a widening bar, and with it the shape of a boot and the glint of a metal hook or baton.

The vial against your ribs tells the truth: its clicking slows as you angle away—then spikes again, sharp and centered, the moment the hatch opens wider. They’re still committed to coming down, not chasing the crate noise.

At the drain run, Harrow is already there, fingers on iron. “Grating,” he whispers. “Tight. Too tight for Tollin unless we—”

His words cut off as you hear the iron complain: someone above has dropped weight through the hatch. A splash, close enough to throw ripples across the standing water near you.

A voice from inside the cellar now—muffled by distance but no longer through wood. The gloved man, breathing controlled. “Lantern down. Find the drain. They’ll go for it.”

A second set of boots hits water. Two of them. Not just one.

Harrow answers your question fast, eyes on the grating. “Bars are bolted into the stone. We can fit you—maybe—if you go sideways. Tollin won’t. We’d have to break it or unseat the bolts.”

Behind you, lantern-light begins to sweep the cellar in slow arcs, catching crate edges and the shine of water. The beam is moving toward the back—toward the drain—methodical, not fooled by the clatter.

Tollin makes a small, involuntary sound as he sees the light coming. Harrow clamps a hand over his mouth, hard enough to make Tollin’s eyes water.

The threat is immediate and physical now: two pursuers are in the cellar with lanterns, closing on the drain, and the grating is a hard choke point—especially with Tollin.

#### Turn 196 **[PLAYER]**

I press my mouth to Tollin’s ear. “Breathe through your nose. If you scream, you die.”  

I slide the vial out, angle it hard toward the lantern-sweep to make it chatter loud and eager, then underhand toss it low across the water toward the far crates—away from the drain—hoping they chase the clicking.  

While their light shifts, I jam my knife into the grout around the nearest bolt and yank with my whole weight, then bark to Harrow, “Help me—break one side, we’ll bend it. Tollin goes first.”

*Agent reasoning: The drain is the only exit but Tollin can’t fit; I’ll try a fast, messy workaround—use the vial to distract/steer the pursuers and brute-force the grating while keeping Tollin quiet.*

#### Turn 197 **[GAME]**

Tollin freezes under Harrow’s hand. He nods once—tiny, frantic—then forces a shallow nasal breath. No scream. Just the wet click of his swallow.

You slide the salt-corked vial out and cant it toward the lantern-sweep. It answers immediately—an eager, insect-fast *tik-tik-tik-tik* that cuts through the cellar’s drip.

You underhand it low across the water.

It skips once, twice, then smacks into a crate slat and rolls under a collapsed board pile—still clicking, now partially muffled but persistent, like something trapped and trying to be found.

The lantern beam reacts. It snaps off the back corner and swings toward the far crates.

One of the men—boots heavier, steps confident—splashes after it. “There,” he says, and you hear him wade through debris.

The other doesn’t fully commit. His light keeps a sliver on your side of the cellar, sweeping the waterline and the drain wall in short, suspicious cuts. He’s learned not to chase every noise in Brinewick.

You drive your knife into the grout around the nearest bolt. The blade bites stone-sand and old lime; your wrist jolts as it hits iron. You yank with your whole weight.

The knife edge chips. The grout fractures—but the bolt doesn’t pop. Instead, the iron ring gives a dull *gong* that carries.

The cautious pursuer’s lantern snaps straight to the sound. The beam lands on you, Harrow, Tollin, and the grating in one clean reveal.

“Drain,” he says, flat and pleased. Then, louder: “Got them.”

He raises his free hand—not with a gun, but with a short, dark tool that looks like a cosh or baton—and starts wading toward you, light held high to keep you blinded.

At the far crates, the other man reaches the clicking vial. The sound abruptly changes—one sharp *clack*, then silence—as he either stomps it or snatches it up and pins the cork. He calls back, annoyed: “Decoy.”

Harrow lunges to your side and throws his shoulder into the grating, fingers clawing for purchase on the bars. The stone around the bolt crumbles more, but it’s slow, stubborn work.

Tollin tries to squeeze toward the opening anyway, but the gap is still too tight; his coat catches and he makes a small ripping sound that feels impossibly loud.

The immediate threat: one pursuer is closing from ten feet away with a lantern and baton, and the second has neutralized your vial and is turning back—fast.

#### Turn 198 **[PLAYER]**

I lunge into the lantern-beam and fling a sheet of filthy water up at his face and lamp, then drop low and sweep my boot at his shin/knee to dump him into the water. “Harrow—service door, now—show me the bolt,” I hiss, hauling Tollin by the collar away from the grating toward that door while Harrow keeps pressure on it if he can. If the man goes down, I’m on him with my knife at his wrist—disarm, not kill—then I’m moving again before the second one gets back.

*Agent reasoning: The drain won’t open fast enough and Tollin can’t fit; we need to buy seconds and create a new escape. The closest threat is the baton man—disable him briefly, then pivot to the bolted service door Harrow mentioned as a plan B while Harrow keeps working the grate.*

#### Turn 199 **[GAME]**

You surge straight into the beam and whip a sheet of cellar-water up with both hands.

It hits his face and the lantern at once—filth and fish-oil. The flame gutters behind the glass with a wet hiss, the light strobing as the chimney chokes. He jerks back, blinking hard, one hand clawing at his eyes.

You drop low and sweep your boot at his forward leg.

Your heel catches shin and ankle; his stance is already compromised from the backstep. He goes down hard into the standing water with a heavy splash, lantern arm flailing. The lantern doesn’t go out completely, but it swings and throws wild, partial light—enough to keep the cellar from going black, not enough to aim cleanly.

He’s trained, though. Even on his back he keeps the baton between you and his ribs and snaps it out in a short, ugly jab toward your thigh.

It glances—painful but not crippling—because you’re already on him.

Knife out, you pin his wrist instead of his throat, blade biting sleeve and skin just enough to make him stop moving that hand. You wrench, hard.

The baton skitters away across the stone with a scraping slide and vanishes under a crate edge.

He makes a sharp sound—more rage than fear—and tries to roll to his knees, but you’re gone before he can grab you.

“Harrow—service door, now—show me the bolt.”

You haul Tollin by the collar. He stumbles, boots dragging, eyes fixed on the lantern’s spasming light like it’s a firing squad. Harrow peels off the grating immediately—no heroics—and leads you fast along the wall to the back service door.

Up close, it’s worse than “bolted”: a thick iron shoot-bolt runs into a stone socket, and a padlock sits on a hasp beneath it—cheap iron, but intact. Harrow points with two fingers. “Bolt here. Lock here. If we pop the lock, I can throw the bolt.”

Behind you, the downed pursuer is already getting up, wiping his face with one sleeve, lantern lifted again—dim but steadier. He squares his shoulders and starts toward you, empty-handed now but not unarmed; you see a short blade flash at his belt as his hand drops for it.

From the far crates comes the other man’s return—fast splashes, closing. “They’re at the back!”

You have a locked service door in front of you, Tollin half-panicking at your elbow, Harrow braced to work the bolt the second the lock gives—and two men converging, one within a few strides and the other seconds behind.

#### Turn 200 **[PLAYER]**

I shove Tollin flat to the wall by the door. “Hands over your mouth. Don’t move unless I pull you.”

I jam my knife through the padlock’s shackle gap and twist sideways as a prybar, then stomp-kick the lock body hard to shock it. “Harrow—ready on the bolt. The second it gives, THROW it.”

Without turning fully, I bark at the nearer man through the dim glare, “One more step and I open you from wrist to elbow—go fetch your friend’s baton.” Then I angle my shoulder to keep the door between Tollin and the lantern-light, listening for the second man’s splash-line closing in.

*Agent reasoning: We need the door open immediately; cheap padlock can be shocked or twisted. I’ll buy seconds by using the lantern glare and threats, and I’ll try a fast destructive bypass—knife as lever plus a hard kick—while Harrow works the bolt. Also keep Tollin from bolting.*

#### Turn 201 **[GAME]**

Tollin hits the wall with a wet thud and immediately clamps both hands over his mouth. His eyes are wide enough to show white all the way around; he nods once, rigid, trying not to breathe loud.

You jam your knife tip into the padlock’s shackle gap and torque it sideways. The metal complains—high, tight—and the knife flexes alarmingly. When you stomp-kick the lock body, the impact shocks through the hasp with a sharp *clang*.

The lock doesn’t pop. It *does* shift: the hasp plate bends a hair, and the padlock rotates, opening the shackle gap just enough that your blade bites deeper. Your knife edge skitters and you feel it notch—one more like that and it may snap or dull beyond use.

“Harrow—ready on the bolt.”

Harrow plants both hands on the bolt handle, body coiled. “Ready,” he says, voice thin.

Your threat to the nearer man lands, but not the way you want.

He doesn’t back off. He stops for half a beat, eyes on your knife at the lock, then he *moves sideways* instead of forward—angling to get a line past you toward Tollin. His hand comes up with the short blade from his belt, held low and tight.

“Don’t bluff with a door,” he says. “You’ll break before it does.”

The lantern in his other hand lifts higher, trying to flood the corner with light. It catches Tollin’s face for an instant; Tollin flinches but keeps his hands clamped over his mouth.

Then the second man arrives—splashing hard, no subtlety now—and his voice comes from your left, closer than you expected: “Back corner!”

He hasn’t come straight at you; he’s looping wide, trying to cut off the service door from the side. In his hand, you see the baton again—retrieved from under the crate edge—dark with slime.

Immediate threats are now clear and split:
- **Knife-man** is five to six feet away, sliding for an angle on Tollin.
- **Baton-man** is coming in from your left flank, close enough to rush in the next second or two.

Harrow is still braced on the bolt, waiting for the lock to give. The padlock is damaged but still holding.

#### Turn 202 **[PLAYER]**

I snatch the edge of the lantern-man’s wrist/lantern arm and yank it down and sideways into the water between us, trying to drown the flame and throw him off-balance; at the same time I kick low behind his ankle to fold him. “Harrow—forget the lock, RIP the hasp—use the bolt bar as a lever!”  

If the lantern sputters out, I surge into the darkness toward the baton-man’s side and slash shallow across his forearm (to make him drop it), then immediately grab Tollin’s collar and shove him tight behind Harrow. “When it opens, you go first—don’t think.”

*Agent reasoning: The lock won’t give fast enough and Tollin’s about to get flanked; I need a dirty, immediate stall and a new way through—use the lantern and their footing, then force the door with brute/lever instead of finesse.*

#### Turn 204 **[PLAYER]**

I blink hard into the murk, keeping my shoulder between Tollin and the lantern-glare. “What do I have—positions, light, and the state of that lock/hasp?” I snap, then lunge for the lantern-man’s wrist to yank the lamp down into the water and kick behind his ankle, hissing to Harrow, “Forget the lock—lever the hasp with the bolt bar and tear it.”

*Agent reasoning: The screen gave me nothing, so I’ll press for sensory details and keep acting in-character—use the moment to clarify what Vesper can see/hear and then commit to a risky move to create darkness and force the door.*

#### Turn 205 **[GAME]**

You’ve got maybe a yard of slick stone between your boots and the service door. The lantern’s light is still struggling—dim, yellow, and wavering—but it’s enough to silhouette everyone in ugly slices.

**Positions:**  
- **Knife-man / lantern-man** is directly in front of you, slightly right, about 5–6 feet out, trying to angle past your shoulder toward Tollin.  
- **Baton-man** is left of you, closing fast on a wide line, baton up and ready.  
- **Harrow** is at the door hardware, hands on the shoot-bolt and hasp area, half-turned toward you.  
- **Tollin** is pinned to the wall just to your right, hands over his mouth, eyes locked on the lantern.

**Door state:** the **padlock is still intact**, but the **hasp plate is bent** from your earlier kick; it’s under stress. The shoot-bolt itself is solid iron and could be used as a lever if Harrow can get purchase under the hasp.

You lunge.

Your hand clamps the lantern-man’s wrist and you yank hard down and sideways, driving the lantern toward the water. He reacts instantly—drops his weight, twists his elbow, and **lets the lantern go** rather than let you control his arm.

The lantern hits the water with a heavy splash. The flame gutters violently behind wet glass—**not out, but choking**, throwing frantic, strobing light across the cellar.

At the same time you kick behind his ankle. Your boot clips him, but he’s already shifting; he **stumbles** instead of folding, catching himself with a wet slap of his palm on a crate corner. He snarls and comes up with his knife hand ready, now unencumbered by the lantern.

“Harrow—forget the lock—lever the hasp—tear it!”

Harrow obeys—fast. He rips at the shoot-bolt bar, jams it under the bent hasp plate, and heaves. Metal shrieks. The hasp plate begins to peel away from the doorframe—**one screw head pops**, spinning out into the water.

But that noise is a bell.

The baton-man takes it as his moment and **rushes your left flank**, baton swinging low-to-high for your ribs/arm. You see it coming in the strobing lantern-light: the strike is imminent, close enough you’ll feel it if you don’t move.

The lantern-man steps in too, knife forward, trying to pin you in place while the baton lands. Tollin stays frozen against the wall, muffled breathing behind his hands. Harrow is still levering—hasp half-torn, but the door is not open yet.

#### Turn 206 **[PLAYER]**

I duck hard toward the door, crashing my shoulder into the baton-man’s inside line as his swing comes up, trying to jam his arm and smother the strike into the wall/doorframe. “Harrow—NOW, tear it!” I snap, then slash quick and shallow at the baton-man’s wrist/forearm to make him drop it, keeping my body angled to block the knife-man’s path to Tollin.

*Agent reasoning: I can’t let them sandwich me; I need to spoil the baton swing and keep the knife-man from getting past me to Tollin while buying Harrow seconds to finish tearing the hasp.*

#### Turn 207 **[GAME]**

You duck in toward the door at the exact moment the baton comes up.

Your shoulder slams into the baton-man’s inside line and you do manage to **jam his swing**—but not cleanly. The baton’s arc collapses into a short, ugly shove and the end of it **clips your upper arm/shoulder** instead of your ribs. It’s a deadened hit, still hard enough to make your arm go briefly numb.

Your momentum carries both of you into the doorframe area. Water splashes up your shins. The baton-man grunts, stumbles, and tries to turn his body to keep the baton between you and him.

“Harrow—NOW, tear it!”

Harrow bears down on the bolt bar like he’s trying to pry the city open. The bent hasp plate gives with a ripping metallic shriek—**a second screw tears free**, leaving the plate hanging by one twisted fastener. The padlock swings uselessly against it.

Not open yet—but it’s **seconds from failing**.

You slash quick and shallow at the baton-man’s wrist/forearm. The blade bites; not deep, but enough to draw a bright ribbon of blood in the lantern’s frantic strobe. His hand spasms.

He **doesn’t drop the baton**—he clamps harder, teeth bared, and uses the pain to fuel a dirty counter: he **drives his shoulder into you**, trying to pin you against the door hardware and keep you from protecting Tollin.

At the same time the lantern-man closes, exploiting your tie-up. He steps in from your right with his knife low and forward, aiming for the gap under your ribs—then checks at the last instant when your angled body blocks his line to Tollin.

“Move,” he hisses, not to you—past you, to the baton-man. “Get him off the door.”

Tollin, seeing the knife come in, finally breaks his freeze: he makes a small, panicked sound behind his hands and **slides sideways along the wall**, trying to get behind Harrow—but he’s exposed for a heartbeat in the strobing light.

Harrow gives one last heave. The remaining fastener **begins to tear**, metal bending outward. The door is about to come free, but right now you’re being **pressed into the threshold** by the baton-man while the knife-man is **within stabbing distance** on your right, hunting an opening.

#### Turn 208 **[PLAYER]**

I stomp down hard on the baton-man’s lead foot and hook my leg behind his knee, then wrench his bleeding wrist across my body to sling him sideways into the knife-man’s path. “Harrow—OPEN! Tollin, GO—NOW!” I bark, and as soon as the door gives I shove Tollin through first, then pivot after him with my knife up, backpedaling to keep both men from rushing the threshold.

*Agent reasoning: I’m pinned at the door and the knife-man is fishing for a gap; the door is seconds from giving, so I need to buy that second and keep Tollin moving. Break the baton-man’s balance into the knife-man and force space, then get Tollin through immediately.*

#### Turn 209 **[GAME]**

Your boot comes down on the baton-man’s lead foot with a wet crunch against stone. He yelps—weight buckles. Your leg hooks behind his knee and you wrench his cut wrist across your body.

He goes sideways the way you want, but not like a clean throw—more like a desperate, bleeding man getting dragged off-balance. His shoulder clips the lantern-man’s knife arm, **spoiling the stab** into a glancing scrape that bites fabric and skin along your right side instead of sinking in. It still burns hot; you feel blood immediately, warm under the cold damp.

The baton-man slams into the knife-man’s chest. The knife-man curses, boots skidding in the water, and he **shoves his ally off** with his forearm. “Idiot—watch your feet!”

“Harrow—OPEN! Tollin, GO—NOW!”

Harrow answers with a grunt and one last heave. The final fastener tears with a shriek and the hasp plate **rips free**. The padlock and plate clatter into the water. The door lurches inward an inch, then sticks—swollen wood. Harrow shoulder-checks it and it **gives**, opening into a narrow service passage beyond, darker and drier.

Tollin moves on your command—stumbles through the gap, nearly trips on the threshold, catches himself on the far wall, and keeps going, breath coming in sharp, panicked pulls.

You shove him fully clear and pivot after, knife up, backpedaling into the passage to keep the opening between you and them.

They don’t let you have space.

The baton-man, limping, **charges the threshold** and swings the baton in a short, brutal arc aimed at your knife hand. The lantern-man stays just behind him, knife ready, using the bigger body as cover—eyes locked past you into the passage like he’s already measuring where Tollin ran.

Behind you, you hear Tollin’s shoes slap fast on stone—retreating deeper into the service way.

Harrow is half in, half out, trying to squeeze through as you give ground. The door, now unlatched, hangs open—but the bottleneck is real: one good shove from either attacker could pin you against the passage wall or knock Harrow back into the cellar.

**Immediate threat:** baton strike at your knife hand, with a knife follow-up the moment your guard breaks.

#### Turn 9 **[GAME]**

Night in **Vellumcrypt Passage**, the narrow stairwell that drops from Moonbriar Cathedral’s south transept into the underside. Rain ticks through a cracked grating overhead, and each bell toll above makes the brick under your palm shiver. The air tastes of ash and sugared myrrh, and lanternlight turns warding nails into thin lines of gold.

You kneel on the third step from the bottom, where the Crown’s “safe route” marker should be. Your slate board rests on your thigh; you set a compass pin into mortar and drag chalk in a careful arc, counting the pull of the hex-line the way you learned to count footsteps in soot-sweet alleys. When the saints’ niches are quiet, you work faster. Tonight they aren’t. Stone mouths whisper in grit-soft syllables as you ink the curve with thorn-black.

The bell tolls again, and your chalk circle jerks a thumb’s breadth to the left—wrong. Your ward-sigil flares, then steadies, as if it had to catch its breath. In the lantern’s edge you see it: beneath the official lattice you were ordered to retrace, a **second grid** shows for a heartbeat, stitched in a precise hand you recognize from your apprenticeship—your own—then vanishes as the ward settles. Footsteps scrape above. A man in Crown leathers descends with the careful pace of someone who knows stairs can bite. His cloak is pinned with a thorn-brooch, but the pin is upside down—an old field sign for *unofficial orders*. He stops two steps above you, close enough that his gloved hand can reach your slate.

“Cartographer Thistledown,” he says, voice low. “Senior Warden Brann wants your draft before dawn. No copies. No annotations. And—” His eyes flick to the saint niche beside you, where the statue’s lips are stained with candle soot. “—if you’ve heard the name **St. Vellum** tonight, you didn’t.”

Another toll rolls through the stone. Your compass needle swings toward the crypt door—toward a route your map says is sealed.

The man extends his hand for your slate while the hex-line keeps drifting under your knees. You have seconds to decide what you hand over, and what you follow.

#### Turn 10 **[PLAYER]**

I tilt the slate slightly away from his hand and keep my chalk moving, as if finishing a necessary measurement. “Before I hand it over, tell me—Brann’s order is about the official lattice, or the drift?” I glance toward the saint niche and murmur under my breath, “If you’re whispering, do it plainly,” while my free hand palms the compass pin to check whether the needle still strains toward the sealed crypt door.

*Agent reasoning: Unofficial orders and a forbidden name mean someone’s hiding a layer of the map; I need to stall, keep my work, and quietly verify what the compass is pulling toward without openly defying the Crown.*

#### Turn 11 **[GAME]**

You keep the chalk moving—just a hair longer than courtesy allows—drawing a final tick mark at the edge of your circle. The escort’s gloved fingers hover, then withdraw an inch. His jaw tightens at the delay, but he doesn’t snatch; instead he shifts his stance to block the stairwell behind him, cutting off the view from above.

Your palm closes around the compass pin. The needle doesn’t merely “strain”—it **tugs** hard enough that you feel it through the metal, dragging its point toward the sealed crypt door at the foot of the stairs. With the next bell toll, it snaps a few degrees farther, as if the door itself just moved closer.

At your question, the man answers too quickly, like he’s repeating a line he was given. “The lattice,” he says. Then, after a beat, quieter: “And the drift—only insofar as it makes the lattice look unreliable. Brann wants a clean map. The kind you can swear on in a hearing.”

Your murmur to the saint niche earns you an immediate response—no gentle whisper, but a dry scrape like grit under teeth. The statue’s stone lips don’t move, yet the words come out from the niche-shadow beside its throat.

“PLAINLY,” it rasps, and then, with a strange tenderness that doesn’t belong in stone: “THE SAFE ROUTE IS A LIE THEY PRACTICE.”

The escort flinches at the voice despite himself. His eyes flick to the niche, then back to you, and his hand goes to the short baton at his belt—not drawn, but ready. “Don’t,” he warns, as if you made the statue speak on purpose. “If it starts naming things, I’m obliged to report—”

A soft click interrupts him: down at the crypt door, the iron seal ring shifts. Not opened—just **settling**, metal on metal, like something on the other side leaned its weight against it.

The threat is clear now: the drifting hex-lines are actively pulling toward that sealed door, and the seal is beginning to respond.

The escort extends his hand again, firmer. “Slate. Now. We leave this stairwell.”

```json
{"inventory_add":[],"inventory_remove":[],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":["Vellumcrypt Passage"],"npcs_add":[{"name":"Crown Escort (unnamed)","faction":"Crown of Thorns","notes":"Assigned to retrieve Eirwen’s draft; wearing an upside-down thorn-brooch indicating unofficial orders."},{"name":"St. Vellum (statue-saint)","faction":"Cathedral of Moonbriar","notes":"Whispers from a niche; reacts when addressed; claims the safe route is a practiced lie."}]}

#### Turn 12 **[PLAYER]**

I slide the slate into his hand—then immediately thumb a quick starlight-ink notation onto my cuff lining, mirroring the drift angle toward the crypt door. Without looking away from the seal, I ask the statue in a low voice, “St. Vellum—one sentence: is the danger the door opening, or the map being lied about?” Then I rise slowly and nod to the escort. “Lead, but not past the third step—I want eyes on that ring until we’re out.”

*Agent reasoning: Brann wants a “clean” map, which means they’re hiding the drift; I need to preserve evidence without provoking the seal or the escort. I’ll comply outwardly, but keep a private record and get one more concrete warning from the saint before moving.*

#### Turn 13 **[GAME]**

The slate slides into the escort’s hand. He grips it with immediate possessiveness, tucking it under his cloak as if it might try to crawl away.

Your thumb moves to your cuff lining out of habit—then meets plain, damp wool. No vial. No pen. No starlight-ink hidden seam. You still manage a mark: a smear of chalk and grime, angled the way the compass yanked, but it’ll wash out with one rain-slick sleeve.

At the niche, St. Vellum answers in a single sentence, exactly as you asked—flat, unornamented, and ugly in its certainty:

“THE DANGER IS THE MAP THAT MAKES THE DOOR OPEN.”

The escort’s head snaps toward the statue. “That’s enough.” He doesn’t draw his baton; instead he takes a small brass whistle from his collar and squeezes it once—silent to your ears, but the air in the stairwell tightens like a drawn thread.

Down at the crypt door, the seal ring shifts again—this time not a settling click, but a slow, deliberate rotation, as if fingers on the far side are testing the shape of the lock through the metal. A thin line of pale dust sifts from the seam and falls in a steady sprinkle, making a faint crescent on the stone threshold.

You rise slowly. The escort nods once at your condition, but he doesn’t “lead” so much as herd: he steps up only two stairs, keeping his body between you and the upper landing while leaving your sightline to the ring open. His eyes never leave your hands now.

“Third step,” he repeats, tight-lipped. “Fine. We back out. Quietly. If that ring turns a full quarter, we run.”

The silent-whistle thread you felt becomes visible in its effect: from somewhere above, bootsteps start down—fast, disciplined. Reinforcements, close.

The threat is immediate and specific: the seal ring is being worked from the inside, and Crown wardens are converging on this stairwell with your confiscated draft in the escort’s custody.  

```json
{"inventory_add":[],"inventory_remove":[],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":[],"npcs_add":[]}

#### Turn 14 **[PLAYER]**

I press my chalk-smeared cuff against the stairwell brick to leave the drift angle as a quick, crude arrow, then step back up to the third step with my hands visible. “Who’s coming—Brann’s people or Cathedral?” I ask the escort softly, and without taking my gaze off the seal ring I add, “If that map ‘makes’ the door open, I want to know whose hand is holding the pen.”

*Agent reasoning: I need a lasting record of the drift and who’s moving against me, but wardens arriving means I must look compliant; I’ll use mundane means to mark the angle and quietly probe the escort’s loyalties while keeping eyes on the ring.*

#### Turn 15 **[GAME]**

You press your cuff to the brick. The chalk-and-grime transfers as a blunt little arrow, angled toward the crypt door. It’s crude, but legible—until the next damp breath of air smears its tail. Still: it’s there.

You step back to the third stair with your hands open. The escort watches you do it, then flicks his gaze to the mark you left. For the first time he looks genuinely uncertain—less about you, more about what he’s been told to contain.

“Brann’s,” he answers softly. “Not Cathedral. Cathedral doesn’t come down like that.”

Bootsteps hit the upper landing: three, maybe four people, moving in practiced spacing. Lanternlight spills down the stairwell in a hard white fan. A voice follows—female, clipped, official.

“Hold position. Hands visible. No one approaches the door.”

Two Crown wardens appear at the top of the stairs in thorn-leathers with ward-sashes. Behind them is a senior figure in a dark coat with a silver-thorn clasp. Her gaze goes straight past you to the crypt seal ring, as if she’s been listening to it for hours.

At your last line—*whose hand is holding the pen*—the escort’s mouth tightens. He doesn’t answer. He can’t, or won’t.

The seal ring below turns another fraction—enough that the old engraved prayer on it slides out of alignment. A faint sound comes through the seam now: not speech, not a growl—more like a slow inhale through teeth, patient and testing. The pale dust at the threshold lifts in a tiny spiral, as if drawn inward.

The senior warden raises her left hand. One of the wardens produces a coil of thorn-iron chain with chalk-sealed links.

“We’re sealing the stair,” she says. “Cartographer Thistledown, you’re coming upstairs. Now.”

The immediate threat is clear: they’re about to chain the stairwell shut with you either above it—or trapped below with the door that’s waking.

#### Turn 16 **[PLAYER]**

I lift my hands higher and start up toward them, slow and deliberate. “I’m coming—don’t chain it yet; if the map is the mechanism, your seal could finish the turn for it,” I say, eyes flicking between the ring’s alignment and the chalk-sealed links. As I reach the senior warden, I keep my voice low: “Name and authority, ma’am—are you acting on Brann’s written order, or his ‘unofficial’ one?”

*Agent reasoning: Getting trapped below with a waking crypt door is a bad gamble; I need to comply outwardly while extracting who’s in charge and buying seconds to observe the seal and chain warding.*

#### Turn 17 **[GAME]**

You climb, palms high. The wardens at the landing track your hands with lantern-glare and hooked attention, but they don’t grab you. The escort shifts aside to let you pass, still clutching your slate under his cloak.

Your warning about the chain makes the junior warden with the coil hesitate mid-motion—links half-lifted, chalk seals flashing white. The senior warden’s eyes flick down the stairwell to the crypt ring, then to the chain, doing the same arithmetic you are.

“Hold,” she says, curt. The coil stops moving.

You reach her. Up close, she smells of camphor and wet iron. Her silver-thorn clasp bears a small notch pattern—rank marks you’ve seen on hearing-room wardens.

You keep your voice low; she answers at the same volume, without leaning in.

“Warden-Seneschal Maudlin Kest,” she says. “Crown of Thorns. Authority: Civic Ward Integrity Act, subsection seven—emergency containment.”

At your question—written order or unofficial—her gaze goes to your escort’s upside-down thorn-brooch, then back to you. It’s a glance that lands like a verdict.

“I’m acting on my own signature,” Kest says. “Brann’s name is a corridor people get lost in.”

Behind her, one of the wardens takes a half-step to block the stairwell mouth, positioning to keep you from looking down. Kest doesn’t stop them—she just continues speaking.

“You’re right about one thing,” she adds, quiet and sharp. “Some seals *help* a turning lock. So we won’t chain.”

She lifts two fingers. The junior warden swaps tools: instead of the thorn-iron chain, he produces a small clay puck stamped with a ward-sigil and presses it to the stone at the stairwell edge. It sticks with a wet *thunk*.

A thin, translucent film—like cooled breath—begins to stretch across the stairwell opening behind you, forming a barrier that will block sound and sight *without* physically jarring the steps.

Down below, the crypt ring turns again—slower now, as if feeling the new ward settle overhead—then pauses. The dust spiral at the threshold collapses and falls still.

Threat, immediate and concrete: Kest is containing the stairwell in a way that cuts you off from observing the seal directly, and she has legal authority on her side; if you resist, you’ll be detained.

#### Turn 18 **[PLAYER]**

I lower my hands and give Kest a small, careful nod. “Understood, Warden-Seneschal—containment without shock is sound.” I glance at the forming film. “But if I can’t observe the ring, I can’t tell you whether your ward is dampening it or feeding it; give me one minute at the edge with a sightline, with your people on my shoulders if you like.”  

Then I tilt my head toward the escort’s cloak. “And I need my slate back—or you read it to me, line for line, while I correct what’s wrong. If Brann’s corridor gets people lost, I’d rather not walk it blind.”

*Agent reasoning: Kest has authority and enough force to detain me; resisting would get me cut off entirely. I need to preserve access to the seal’s behavior and learn what Brann is doing, so I’ll comply while negotiating a controlled observation and reclaiming my slate or at least a supervised copy.*

I keep my posture calm and compliant, but angle my body to maintain any sliver of view past the forming film. “Warden-Seneschal Kest—one minute of sightline at the edge, with two wardens holding my shoulders, and I’ll tell you whether that ward dampens or drives the turn.” I nod toward the escort’s cloak. “And either return my slate to my hands, or read it aloud to me line by line before it leaves this landing.”

*Agent reasoning: Kest has legal authority and is actively cutting off my sightline; pushing too hard could get me detained, but I need at least one last look at the ring and my slate so the map can’t be weaponized without my input.*

*Agent reasoning: Kest has legal authority and is already sealing the stairwell; pushing too hard could get me detained and cut off entirely. I should offer a controlled compromise: supervised sightline and immediate verification of the slate, while staying compliant and gathering names/chain-of-custody.*

I keep my hands visible and look to Warden‑Seneschal Kest. “I didn’t catch your answer—will you grant me sixty seconds at the edge with two wardens holding my shoulders, yes or no?” I nod toward the escort’s cloak. “And my slate: return it to my hands, or read it aloud line by line here, now—what’s your choice?”

*Agent reasoning: With no new information displayed, I’ll cautiously press for clarity and try to secure a sightline and my slate without escalating—asking Kest directly and offering controlled conditions.*

#### Turn 25 **[GAME]**

Kest’s face doesn’t change, but his eyes flick once—past you, to the stairwell where the thin, iridescent film is knitting itself from bell-hum and damp air. The escort’s cloak hangs like a dark mouth over the landing rail, swallowing lanternlight at the edges.

“Yes,” Kest says, crisp as a seal being pressed. “Sixty seconds. Two hands on you. No chalk. No prayers. No sudden turns.”

He gestures without looking away. Two Crown wardens step in close—one on each side—gloved hands settling on your shoulders with practiced firmness. Not rough, but immovable. Their thumbs find the seam where collarbone meets cloak, anchoring you as if you’re a cart they mean to keep from rolling.

Kest continues, “Your slate: I choose to read.”

The escort—still hooded—produces your slate from inside the cloak as if it had been there all along. He holds it flat in both hands, angled so you can see the surface but not touch it. A thin strip of pale material—Crown-issued correction vellum—peeks from his sleeve like a tongue.

Kest steps closer and begins reading aloud, line by line, voice steady.

He gets through your last clean measurements—then pauses on a segment where the chalk is smudged, as if a fingertip tested it. He looks up at you for the first time.

“‘Second lattice under official grid… stitched in a hand I recognize…’” He stops before the name you would have written. The escort’s thumb shifts, just barely, as if ready to lay that correction strip down.

The wardens guide you forward to the edge. The film is now a visible skin across the stair-mouth: oil-sheen colors, trembling with each distant toll. Up close it doesn’t look like glass; it looks like a membrane that wants to breathe you.

As your boots reach the lip, the film dimples inward toward you—responding to your presence—then tightens, like it’s deciding whether to admit you or reflect you.

You have your sixty seconds. If you lean into the edge, you’ll be within a breath of the film; if you pull back, Kest’s reading continues and the escort’s correction strip is poised to touch your slate.

#### Turn 26 **[PLAYER]**

I hold still at the lip—close enough to watch the film dimple, but I don’t lean in or breathe on it—eyes tracking the shimmer for any pulse, backflow, or sympathetic “turn” that matches the ring below. “Kest, keep reading that line—finish it aloud. Escort, don’t lay vellum on my slate; if you change a word before I hear it, I’ll treat it as tampering.”

*Agent reasoning: The film reacts to proximity; I need a sightline without touching it, and I can’t let them alter my slate. I’ll use my minute to observe safely while forcing Kest to keep reading the paused line aloud before any “correction” happens.*

#### Turn 27 **[GAME]**

You freeze at the lip, letting the film do what it wants without giving it breath or heat. The membrane dimples toward you again—then steadies. In the sheen you catch a pattern: the colors don’t swirl randomly; they “tick” in faint, regular increments, like a slow gear. Each tick coincides with a distant bell-note—half a heartbeat after the sound arrives through stone. It isn’t dampening anything. It’s *listening*, then responding.

A thin backflow ripples outward from the dimple—away from you, down the stair-mouth—like the film is pushing an answer into the ward-lines below.

Kest doesn’t finish your line.

He keeps his voice even, but he switches tracks mid-sentence as if the words have become officially unfit to exist in air. “—stitched in a hand you *claim* to recognize,” he reads, and the phrasing is wrong; you can hear the bureaucratic edge of it, the way an affidavit rewrites a witness.

The escort’s thumb moves.

Not to place vellum—yet—but to *cover* the next word on the slate with the pad of his glove. He does it casually, like adjusting grip. The pale correction strip remains poised, still clean.

“You will not threaten a Crown chain-of-custody while standing on an active boundary,” Kest says, quiet. “You will observe. You will report. You will not dictate procedure.”

The wardens’ hands tighten on your shoulders. One of them—left side—leans close enough that you feel his breath anyway. “Time,” he murmurs, counting under his tongue.

At the edge, the film reacts to that warm exhale: the dimple deepens sharply, as if tasting. A hair-thin filament unspools from the membrane toward your throat—no thicker than a spider strand, shining oil-blue.

It doesn’t touch you yet.

But it’s reaching, and if it makes contact, it’s close enough to snag skin or breath and pull *something* through the boundary with it.

*Simulation triggers: secret_Ward The Escort’s Cloak_1_f1bd38, secret_Ward The Escort’s Cloak_0_867a90*

#### Turn 28 **[PLAYER]**

I clamp my lips shut and hold my breath, chin tucked hard to protect my throat, then give a small backward jerk against the wardens’ hands to signal retreat. “Back—now. Your man’s breath is feeding it; it’s listening to the bell and pushing a backflow down the stair.” As we move, I keep my eyes on the filament and add, tight-voiced, “Kest, that rewrite proves tampering—seal the slate under my mark before he ‘corrects’ anything.”

*Agent reasoning: The filament is reacting to breath/heat and could latch onto me; I need to reduce stimulus and back away safely while reporting what I observed, and also stop the warden from breathing on the boundary.*

#### Turn 29 **[GAME]**

The backward jerk breaks the wardens’ practiced stillness. They react on training, not deference: both hands haul you back in the same moment, boots scraping stone as they pull you off the lip.

The filament snaps forward anyway—your retreat makes it *whip*, like a line cast at a moving target. It skims your collar and catches on a single hair near your nape. For an instant it tenses, drawing a pinprick of cold along your skin, as if testing for purchase.

Then the left warden—breath still held in his chest now—brings his forearm up between you and the stair-mouth. The filament touches his sleeve instead. It clings.

The membrane dimples hard, as if satisfied, and the hair-thin line thickens to the width of twine. It begins to reel, pulling on the warden’s arm with a steady, patient force—not a jerk, but a *tow*. His shoulder yanks forward a fraction. Leather creaks. His boots slide a finger’s breadth toward the lip.

“Cut it,” the right warden barks, reaching for a knife that isn’t there—Crown protocol near boundaries forbids exposed steel unless ordered.

Kest lifts one hand sharply. “Hold. Do not sever without my word.”

He steps in, finally looking at the film rather than you. “Your observation stands,” he says, clipped. “It responds to breath and bell.”

At your accusation, his gaze flicks to the slate. The escort’s gloved thumb is still covering the next word. The correction vellum is still clean, but now it’s obvious what it’s for.

Kest doesn’t seal it under *your* mark.

“Chain-of-custody is mine,” he says. “Escort—fold it. Bind it.”

The escort produces a black waxed cord from within the cloak and begins wrapping the slate with quick, competent turns, pinning your writing out of sight. He does it in front of you—deliberately—without reading the covered word aloud.

Meanwhile the left warden grits his teeth as the tether tightens. The pull increases by degrees, syncing to the bell’s after-beat. With each distant toll, the line gives a small, inexorable tug—trying to walk him back to the edge.

The immediate threat is clear: if the tether isn’t neutralized, the warden will be dragged to the lip, and whatever the membrane is “admitting” will have an anchored path into your landing.

#### Turn 30 **[PLAYER]**

“Don’t cut—smother.” I yank my scarf up and wrap it tight around the tether where it meets his sleeve, then press my gloved palm over it to deaden vibration. “Both of you—pull him back on my count, and hold your breath on the bell.”

I glance at Kest, sharp. “Order cloth and quiet—now. The line’s keyed to the toll; if you let it keep ‘hearing,’ it’ll walk him into the film.”

*Agent reasoning: The tether is escalating with each bell toll; waiting for Kest could get the warden dragged in. Steel is forbidden, so I’ll use nonmetal measures: smother the line’s “listening” by muffling sound/breath and breaking contact with cloth and salt-chalk. Also, Kest just compromised my slate; I’ll press for a seal later—survival first.*

“Don’t cut—smother.” I whip my scarf up and bind it tight over the tether where it bites into his sleeve, pressing my gloved palm down to deaden any tremor. “Both of you, brace and pull him back on my count—no breathing on the toll.”

I cut my eyes to Kest. “Order cloth and silence, now. The line is keyed to the bell’s after-beat; if it keeps ‘hearing,’ it’ll walk him into the film.”

*Agent reasoning: The tether is syncing to bell vibrations and breath; cutting could escalate or open a path, so smothering and coordinated pulling on the bell’s lull is safer. I also need Kest to enforce silence and get cloth to dampen the line.*

#### Turn 33 **[GAME]**

Your scarf bites down over the tether, wool-on-twine, and for a heartbeat it works exactly as you intend: the line’s glossy shimmer dulls under the cloth, the pull stutters, and the warden’s arm stops creeping.

Then the bell’s next note arrives—felt more than heard—and the tether answers by *singing through the fabric*.

Not sound: vibration. Your palm buzzes as if you’ve pressed it to a plucked wire. The scarf fibers lift in tiny, frantic hairs. The line doesn’t care that it’s muffled; it cares that it’s *touched*. Where the cloth compresses it, the tether swells, thickening another fraction, and the pull resumes—steadier, more confident, as though now it has a better grip.

“Brace!” you snap.

Both wardens obey. The right one hooks an elbow around the left warden’s belt and leans back, heels digging into the gritty stone. The tether draws taut; the left warden’s shoulder jerks forward a full handspan—then stops as the two bodies counterweight. Their held breath shows in their throats, not their mouths.

Kest reacts late, but he reacts. He turns his head and lifts a flat hand. “Silence. No speech. No breath toward the boundary.”

The escort, mid-wrap on the slate, pauses—then deliberately exhales through his nose anyway, a thin, quiet stream. It’s small. It’s enough.

The membrane at the stair-mouth dimples deeper, and the “oil” film puckers into a shallow funnel aligned with the tether. The twine-line pulls again on the bell’s after-beat, and this time it drags the left warden’s boot sole to the very edge—stone grit spilling over into the film like sand into ink.

Behind the hanging ward-cloak on the landing wall, something answers the bell as well.

A faint metallic *chime-chatter* wakes in the brick: thorn-iron warding nails, driven in a crescent “smile” around a hairline crack, begin to vibrate in place. The cloak’s hem flutters though there’s no wind. From the nails comes a low chorus, not words, but the sense of many small mouths humming in agreement.

The new threat is immediate and physical: the tether is now anchored and synchronized to the bell, actively hauling the left warden into the membrane, while the awakened ward-nails behind you are starting to resonate—if they fully “sing,” they’ll reinforce the boundary’s pull and make the landing itself unsafe to stand on.

I clap my free hand over the left warden’s mouth and nose through his mask/cloth to stop any leak of breath, then bark at Kest, “Gag the escort—now—he’s feeding it on purpose.” 

Keeping my body low and back from the lip, I yank my chalk-pouch loose and fling a fistful of dust over the vibrating thorn-iron nails and the crack behind the cloak to foul their “song,” then hiss to the right warden, “On the next toll’s *after-beat*, haul—hard—straight back; don’t fight between notes.”

*Agent reasoning: Touching the tether strengthened it; I need to stop the resonance and remove its anchor without cutting. The ward-nails are amplifying—damping them buys seconds. The escort is actively feeding the boundary; isolate his breath and get Kest to restrain him.*

I clamp my hand over the left warden’s mouth and nose through his mask to stop any breath leak, keeping my face turned away from the stair. “Kest—gag the escort, now. He’s feeding it on purpose.”  

Staying low, I fling a fistful of chalk-dust over the vibrating thorn-iron nails and the crack behind the cloak to foul their resonance, then hiss to the right warden, “Wait for the toll’s after-beat—then haul him back hard, straight back. Don’t pull between notes.”

*Agent reasoning: The tether is keyed to breath and the bell’s after-beat; stopping airflow and disrupting resonance buys seconds. The escort is intentionally feeding the boundary, so he must be silenced immediately. I also need to damp the ward-nails’ vibration before the landing becomes a resonant amplifier.*

#### Turn 37 **[GAME]**

Your gloved hand seals the left warden’s mask hard enough that his breath stops *audibly*—no hiss, no fogging. His eyes flare wide, then fix on you in panic, but his chest doesn’t heave; he holds.

Kest doesn’t argue. He’s already moving.

He steps in behind the escort and snaps the man’s chin up with two fingers, then jams a folded strip of his own sleeve-cloth between the escort’s teeth and ties it off with a quick, ugly knot. The escort tries to bite through it, cheeks bulging with a muffled curse. Kest’s voice is flat. “You breathe when I let you.”

The escort’s earlier deliberate exhale stops. The film at the stair-mouth loses a little of its eager funnel-shape—still pulling, but less *hungry*. The tether’s vibration under your scarf remains, synced to the bell’s after-beat, but it no longer gets that extra “push” from warm breath.

Your chalk-dust arcs in a pale burst over the landing wall. It hits the vibrating thorn-iron nails and the hairline crack behind the ward-cloak.

Immediate effect: the nails’ chime-chatter breaks. Several nails go dull at once, their vibration choking as chalk packs into the tiny gaps around their heads. Two nails, however, *spit* the dust off in a sharp twitch—like a dog shaking off water—and keep humming, higher and more insistent. The crack behind the cloak darkens as the chalk clings to something damp and slightly oily in the brick.

Consequence: the ward-cloak’s hem stops fluttering wildly, but the crack itself becomes the new problem. The dark line widens by a hair, and a thin thread of soot-sweet air exhales from it—cold, wrong, and *directional*, as if the wall is now “breathing” toward the stair-mouth.

The right warden nods once, jaw clenched, and plants his boots. He waits—still as a nail—through the bell’s main note.

Then the after-beat hits.

He hauls *hard*, straight back, just as you ordered. The tether snaps taut; the left warden’s boot sole scrapes free of the lip with a gritty rip, and his whole body jerks backward into the landing. His shoulder dislocates with a wet pop that you feel through the line more than hear. He screams into your hand, muffled and panicked, but he’s *out* of the film.

The danger shifts, not gone: the tether, denied its prey, whips sideways on the after-beat and slaps toward the wall—aiming for the chalk-fouled nails and the widening crack, trying to re-anchor to something that’s still “singing.”

I shove the scarf-wrapped section of tether down into my own chalk-pouch and cinch it tight like a muffler, then lunge to pin the pouch under my boot heel so it can’t slap the wall. “Kest—rip those two humming nails out or cap them in wax, now—before it finds them.”  

Without lifting my face toward the stair, I press my forearm across the dislocated warden’s chest to keep him from surging forward and hiss to the other, “Drag him back another pace—slow—then strap his arm to his body; no heroic pulls.”

*Agent reasoning: The tether is trying to re-anchor to the singing nails/crack; stopping contact is priority. I should redirect it to something inert/isolated and reduce resonance, while stabilizing the injured warden without adding breath/sound.*

Keeping my face turned from the stair, I press my forearm across the dislocated warden’s chest to still him and hiss to the other, “Drag him back one more pace—slow—then strap his arm to his ribs. No heroic yanks.”

#### Turn 43 **[GAME]**

The scarf-wrapped tether fights you like a hooked fish. When you jam it into the chalk-pouch, the pouch *kicks* against your palm—then you cinch the cord and stamp down.

It works: the line’s whip becomes a tight, furious *thrumming* trapped in canvas and chalk. Your heel pins it, but the vibration transmits up your boot-bone in pulses timed to the bell’s fading after-beat. Chalk inside the pouch puffs in tiny bursts with each pulse, leaking a pale seam out from under your sole.

That seam draws attention.

The widening crack behind the ward-cloak “breathes” toward it—cold air threading straight to the chalk dust as if it’s scent. The crack doesn’t open wide, but its edge darkens and *slicks*, and a thin soot-filament extrudes from the brick like a cautious tongue, reaching for the chalk-streak under your boot.

Kest moves the instant you speak. He doesn’t have wax—his hands go to iron. He hooks a pry-knife under the first humming nail and rips. The nail comes free with a shriek of metal on brick… and the hum jumps into the knife for a heartbeat, making the blade sing. Kest flinches, drops the knife, and the sound dies as it clatters.

The second nail resists. He yanks harder; it tears out with a wet snap, not dry—something fibrous clings to its shank like black tendon. The moment it’s free, the stair-mouth’s film *shivers* and thins, as if deprived of a tuning fork.

But the soot-filament from the crack reacts instead—jerking toward the nail in Kest’s fist.

“Drop it,” you hear the uninjured warden rasp, and he grabs the dislocated one by the belt and collar as ordered. He drags him back one pace—slow, controlled. The injured man bucks once under your forearm, eyes wild, then goes slack with a strangled sob.

“Strap—strap it,” the uninjured warden says through clenched teeth. He fumbles for a leather strap at his own waist, hands shaking, and starts binding the dislocated arm tight to the man’s ribs.

Kest swears under his breath and flings the second nail away from the wall. It skitters across the landing stones, leaving a faint dark smear. The soot-filament snaps after it—stretching thin, then recoiling back toward the strongest remaining “signal” on the landing:

the chalk-pouch under your heel.

The threat is immediate and physical now: a soot-thread is reaching from the widening crack toward the chalk leaking from under your boot, trying to find purchase on the pinned tether.

“Salt—now. Any of you—salt!” I keep my heel planted, then scrape my boot sideways to smear the leaking chalk into a wide, dull patch away from the crack instead of a clean seam.

*Agent reasoning: The soot-thread is homing on the chalk seam and the pinned tether; I need to break that “scent line” and add a warding barrier without freeing the tether. Salt/iron should disrupt soot/haunt matter, and we should retreat from the crack while it’s still a filament, not a limb.*

Your heel grinds chalk into the stone until the leak loses its sharp geometry—sigil-lines blur into a dead, dusty bruise. The crack doesn’t close, but the *pull* from it falters, like a mouth forced to chew wool instead of meat.

The iron compass bites clean. As you score the crescent, the gouge flashes cold and bright—iron arguing with whatever warmth is breathing under the stair. A thin thread of soot-laced incense lifts from the crack and bends toward your pouch… then hesitates at the crescent line, shivering as if it’s found a fence it can’t name.

“No salt,” Kest snaps—close enough that you catch the edge of his breath, too controlled. He still obeys. He scoops the smeared warding nail with two fingers like it’s a slug and pitches it into the stair-mouth.

The nail lands with a *ping*—and the sound doesn’t echo right. It comes back wrong, half a bell-note, half a swallowed cough.

The crack *drinks* the iron.

Not the whole nail—just its intent. The metal skitters an inch on the stone as if nudged, but the air around it tightens. The incense-thread that had been nosing toward your pouch snaps down toward the stair-mouth instead, pulled hard—fed iron, as ordered.

For a heartbeat, the pressure on your pinned pouch eases. You can move it now if you act.

Then the stair-mouth answers: a wet, inward sigh from below, and a ripple runs through the mortar lines like something shifting its shoulders beneath the steps. The bells above thrum once—distant, but timed too neatly—and the crescent gouge you made frosts over with a lace of black grit.

Kest backs away from the wall fast, palm up in a warding gesture. “It’s *learning*, Thistledown. Whatever’s down there—it’s learning what you feed it.”

From the crack, a whisper leaks—not words, a *direction*: the sensation of a corridor where no corridor should be, angled lover-shaped toward the underside. The crack widens a hair. Enough for a fingertip. Enough for a name to fit through if spoken.

I scoop the chalk-pouch up under my heel—keeping the cord cinched—and hop it back two careful paces, away from the crescent and the crack, then pin it again with my boot. “No names. No prayers. If you feel a word rising, bite your tongue.”

I glance at Kest and jerk my chin toward the wardens. “Get their mouths covered—cloth, glove, anything—then watch the stair-mouth for a second ‘ping.’” With my thumb I smear a bit of chalk grit across the iron crescent’s edge to thicken it, and I lean close to the crack without offering breath. “Tell me what you *want* without speech—show me with pull. Where does your corridor lead?”

*Agent reasoning: The pull has eased, so I should relocate the tethered pouch before it reasserts; the crack is trying to bait a spoken name, so I need silence and a counter-ward. With no salt, use iron and spit/soot-chalk to blunt the “direction,” and keep the wardens controlled.*

#### Turn 53 **[GAME]**

You hop the chalk-pouch back—cord clenched, no swing—and the moment it’s two paces off, the crack’s attention slips off it like a hand losing purchase. When you pin it again under your boot, the pressure stays *duller*. Your crescent gouge holds its line; the chalk grit you smear along its edge cakes into the frost-black lace and turns it into a thicker, uglier barrier.

Kest moves fast. He yanks his cloak up over his own mouth and shoves a spare glove into one warden’s hands; the other warden tears a strip from their sleeve with their teeth before Kest slaps it away and forces the cloth over their lips. “No teeth,” he hisses. “No tongue.”

At the stair-mouth, the nail gives a second *ping*—fainter, as if the sound is happening one step lower than it should. The stone around the stair’s lip dimples inward, soft as wax for a blink, then returns to brick. Whatever’s below is testing weight.

You lean to the crack without breathing into it. The crack widens another hair, not from force, but from *permission*—as if it’s responding to the rules you set. The pull you asked for comes in a clean, physical way: dust on the step skates toward the crack in two distinct streams, then veers, refusing the iron crescent like it’s a cliff edge.

Those dust-streams sketch a route for you—an angle down and left, under the cathedral’s crypt-stairs, toward the soot-sweet alleys. Not the main descent: a side run that shouldn’t exist. You feel it in your molars like a distant organ note.

Then the corridor “shape” tightens into something more specific: a *gap* the size of a shoulder, the impression of a door that opens only when someone stands alone and thinks of a particular face. The crack can’t show you the face, but it can show you the cost: your pinned pouch tugs once, sharply, as if the corridor wants your chalk like a tithe.

Kest keeps his eyes on the stair-mouth. Through the cloth over his mouth his words come thick: “It leads to a choke—someone’s made a throat there. If it opens, it won’t open onto empty.”

From below, a third sound answers—not a ping. A slow scrape, like metal being turned over in a palm. Something down the stairs has picked up the nail.

#### Turn 54 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my boot pinning the chalk-pouch and hiss, “No one goes down, no one stands alone—pair up, shoulders touching.” I pull a second iron token (any spare pin/clip) from my kit and set it on the *far* side of my crescent as a decoy, then sprinkle a thin ring of chalk dust around the stair-mouth—wide, not a seam—watching which way it drifts. “Kest, can you see it? Shadow, heat, anything—what’s holding the nail?”

*Agent reasoning: Something below has the nail and is testing the stair-mouth; we should avoid giving it more “iron” or any names, and gather info without opening the corridor. I want to secure the chalk, reinforce the ward, and probe for what kind of entity is holding the nail.*

#### Turn 56 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my boot planted on the chalk-pouch and hiss, “No one goes down. No one stands alone—pair up, shoulders touching.” I slide a spare iron pin onto the far side of my crescent as a decoy, then sift a wide, thin ring of chalk dust around the stair-mouth and watch which way it creeps. “Kest—can you see it? Shadow, heat, anything—what’s holding the nail?”

*Agent reasoning: We’ve got an active lure-response: it’s handling the nail and probing the stair-mouth. I want to avoid anyone getting isolated, gather more sensory info, and use a decoy plus chalk drift to read airflow/pull without feeding it names or breath.*

#### Turn 57 **[GAME]**

Your boot stays planted; the chalk-pouch doesn’t skitter. The tug at it comes once—testing—then fades, like a hand deciding it can’t pry you loose without asking louder.

Kest grabs the two wardens by their sleeves and physically shoves them together, shoulder-to-shoulder. One of them flinches, eyes wide over the cloth, but they obey. Kest keeps his own shoulder pressed to theirs, making a tight cluster. No one steps toward the stair.

You slide the spare iron pin onto the far side of your crescent. The moment it touches stone, the black grit-lace along the crescent *crawls*—a fine rime of soot shifting like filings toward a magnet—trying to bridge the gap to the pin. It can’t cross the iron line you scored, but it gathers there, eager.

When you sift the wide ring of chalk dust around the stair-mouth, the dust doesn’t drift evenly. It crawls in three behaviors at once:

- Along the *outer* edge of the ring, it creeps clockwise, slow and steady, as if the air itself is turning.
- At two points—left and down-left—the dust pulls inward in thin tongues, drawn toward the stair like breath.
- Directly in front of the lowest visible step, the chalk lies dead-still, as if pressed flat by an unseen palm.

That still patch is your answer: something is occupying that space, displacing air without moving it.

Kest leans, squinting hard into the stair-mouth. “Heat—yes,” he says, voice muffled by cloak. “Not body heat. Like a kettle left near-boil.” He jerks his chin at the dead-still chalk. “There. It’s bending the light—barely. Like looking through greasy glass.”

As he speaks, the scrape below becomes a deliberate *tap… tap… tap*—metal on stone—counting. The nail is being tested against the steps, like someone checking its weight and edge.

Then the dead-still patch in your chalk ring shifts forward by half a step.

A pressure touches the underside of your boot—*not* lifting it, but feeling for the chalk-pouch through leather, like a fingertip finding a pulse.

The wardens make a small, involuntary sound behind their cloth. Kest clamps a hand on the nearer one’s jaw to keep it shut. “It’s right at the lip,” he says. “And it’s reaching.”

#### Turn 58 **[PLAYER]**

I slowly ease my boot off the chalk-pouch—keeping the cord looped tight in my fingers—and slide the pouch back to Kest with a sharp hand signal to stow it sealed. With my other hand I flick the spare iron pin a pace closer to the stair-mouth, then drag a thick chalk bar straight across the lip like a threshold and whisper through clenched teeth, “Watch the still patch—does it follow the iron or the chalk?”

*Agent reasoning: It’s probing for my chalk; I need to deny it the tithe and learn its boundary without feeding it breath or a name. A decoy offering placed away from us might pull it back, while we reinforce the lip and prepare to retreat if it surges.*

#### Turn 59 **[GAME]**

As your boot lifts, the pressure under it vanishes—then returns immediately, sharper, as if whatever’s at the lip has been waiting for that exact surrender.

You keep the cord looped tight and slide the chalk-pouch back. Kest catches it without looking away from the stair-mouth. He yanks open his satchel with his teeth, stuffs the pouch inside, and snaps the flap shut under his palm like he’s smothering a candle. He gives you a curt nod: sealed, contained.

You flick the spare iron pin closer.

The pin skitters, then stops dead a handspan from the lip—like it hit invisible tar. For a heartbeat it trembles in place, vibrating so fast it blurs, and the scrape below answers with a pleased little *tap* on stone.

You drag the thick chalk bar across the stair-lip. The chalk screams faintly on brick and leaves a bold threshold line—too thick to be subtle, too clean to be ignored.

The “still patch” reacts in two distinct ways:

- It does **not** follow the chalk. The chalk line holds its shape; dust near it settles as if the air has decided to behave.
- It **does** recoil from the iron. The dead-still area snaps back a fraction when the pin stops, as if the iron has suddenly become a hot brand.

Kest watches, eyes narrowed. “It hates the iron,” he says. “Chalk’s just… a rule it can negotiate.”

Then the pin, still stuck in “tar,” begins to slide on its own—inch by inch—toward the stair-mouth, against the grain of the stone. Not pulled by gravity; drawn.

From below, the metal-on-stone tapping becomes a single, careful *drag*, like someone drawing a blade along a step. The nail you dropped is being used as a tool down there.

At the lip, the air warps—greasy-glass shimmer—right where your chalk threshold crosses. Something presses against the threshold from the underside. The chalk line smears in one spot, not from your hand, but from contact: a rounded edge pushing up, testing if the “rule” breaks.

Kest shifts his stance, keeping the wardens tight. “Eirwen,” he says low, “it’s trying to come *through* the line. And it’s using the pin to bait a crossing.”

#### Turn 60 **[PLAYER]**

“Don’t move—no one crosses that chalk.” I hook the spare iron pin with the tip of my iron compass (staying well back from the lip) and try to drag it away from the stair-mouth, keeping the compass between me and the shimmer. “Kest, keep that pouch sealed—if it reaches again, stamp the satchel shut and back up. Wardens: eyes on the smear; if it bulges, shout—no words, just noise.”

*Agent reasoning: It recoils from iron but can negotiate chalk; I should reinforce iron barriers, avoid stepping over the threshold, and prevent it from pulling the pin or using the nail as leverage. I also need more intel without giving it names or breath.*

#### Turn 61 **[GAME]**

“No one crosses,” you hiss—and for a moment, the stair-mouth feels like a held breath.

You hook the spare iron pin with the tip of your iron compass and pull.

The compass bites the pin with a clean *click*—iron on iron—and the pin jerks free of the invisible “tar” with a sound like tearing cloth. It skates back toward you a full pace, scraping sparks from the brick.

The shimmer at the lip reacts immediately: it *flinches* away from the compass-point like it’s been struck. The bulge under the chalk threshold collapses, and the smeared spot on the line stops moving.

But the release has consequences.

From below, the tapping stops. Silence—thick, listening silence—then a wet, deliberate *inhale* rises up the stairwell, as if the stair itself is drawing breath. The chalk dust ring you laid earlier shivers and begins to creep inward in thin threads toward the lip, as though something is drinking the air through the crack.

Kest does exactly what you told him: he keeps the satchel hugged to his ribs, one boot ready to stomp the flap. He backs a half-step without breaking the shoulder-contact chain with the wardens. “Sealed,” he mutters. “I’m not letting it smell it.”

The two wardens lock their eyes on the smear. When the chalk line *dimples*—a shallow, thumbprint depression forming from beneath—they don’t speak. They make noise: one barks a harsh, wordless shout; the other slaps his own cheekplate hard enough to ring. The sound is ugly and loud in the tight brick throat.

The dimple pauses, as if startled.

Then, in response to the noise, the shimmer changes tactics: it doesn’t push up anymore. It slides sideways along the underside of your chalk threshold, searching for an edge—an end to the line, a gap, a place where “no crossing” becomes “around.”

You can see it now by what it does to the dust: a moving absence, a thumb-sized void traveling left along the lip, hugging the chalk like a thief hugging a wall.

Threat, clear and immediate: whatever is at the stair-mouth cannot comfortably pass iron, can press and test chalk, and is now trying to **bypass your threshold by slipping around it** rather than breaking through.

Your compass hand tingles—faint numbness in the fingertips that held the iron point closest to the shimmer—like you dipped them in cold ash.

#### Turn 62 **[PLAYER]**

“Back another step—still paired,” I tell them, keeping my voice tight. I shake out my numb compass hand once, then plant the iron compass point-down on the stone to my left like a spike, and with my other hand I draw a fresh chalk line from my existing threshold straight to the compass—making a hooked corner—then ask Kest, “Any loose iron we can lay as a continuous edge? Chain, nails, keys—anything long.”

*Agent reasoning: It’s trying to go around my chalk line; iron makes it flinch. I need to extend the barrier with iron without stepping close, and I want more information about how far it can travel along the lip. Also my numb fingers are a warning—limit exposure and keep everyone paired and back.*

#### Turn 63 **[GAME]**

They back up another step in the tight little chain Kest forced—boots scraping, cloaks pulling. The stair-mouth stays where it is, but the *sense* of it crawls forward, like a smell you can’t outwalk.

You shake your hand once. The numbness doesn’t leave; it breaks into pins-and-needles and then settles into a dull, cold ache in the first two fingers—as if the iron conducted something into you rather than away.

You plant the iron compass point-down to your left. The stone answers with a crisp *tick* and a faint vibration up the shaft. For half a second, the greasy shimmer at the lip twitches toward the compass like it’s noticed a candle in a dark room—then recoils again, wary.

You draw a fresh chalk line from the threshold to the compass, making a hooked corner—an L-shaped “no-around” that turns the lip into a penned edge.

Outcome: the moving void under the threshold reaches the corner, hesitates, and stops. It can’t “slide” past the bend as easily; your hook forces it to choose between pressing through chalk (risky, slow) or approaching the iron spike (pain).

But the hook creates a new pressure point: the chalk at the corner begins to **powder** on its own, grains lifting as if teased by breath from below. Something is testing the corner with suction rather than force.

Kest answers your question without taking his eyes off the lip. He pats himself down fast. “Keys,” he says, then swears. “Not long. Two nails in my boot-sole, and a clasp.” He jerks his chin at the wardens. “You two—iron?”

One warden fumbles at his belt and comes up with a short thorn-iron rosary chain—maybe a foot long—beads like tiny burrs. The other has three warding nails and a cracked iron buckle.

As the rosary chain comes into view, the shimmer at the lip reacts hard: the void retreats a full handspan from your chalk corner, and the air in the stairwell gives a thin, angry *hiss*, like steam hitting cold metal.

Threat, immediate and concrete: it’s now fixated on the iron objects. The suction at the chalk corner weakens, but the shimmer shifts lower, as if preparing to lunge at whichever hand brings iron closest to the lip—trying to snatch or foul it.

#### Turn 64 **[PLAYER]**

“Good—rosary chain, on the floor, not in your hand.” I motion the warden to lay it down with his boot, linking it from my iron compass spike toward the chalked threshold to make a continuous iron boundary. With my aching fingers I pinch a fresh scatter of chalk dust and salt it thick at the corner that’s powdering, then to Kest I murmur, “If it lunges, we drop iron and retreat—no heroics. Do you hear breath, steps, or just that hiss?”

*Agent reasoning: The thing recoils from iron but may lunge to snatch it; I should extend an iron “edge” without putting hands near the lip, and reinforce the chalk corner before suction erodes it.*

#### Turn 65 **[GAME]**

The warden with the rosary chain goes pale at the idea of touching it near the lip, but he obeys. He crouches without breaking the paired line, hooks the chain with the toe of his boot, and *shuffles* it forward bead by bead.

As the thorn-iron beads scrape stone, the shimmer under the threshold reacts like a cat to a thrown pan: it snaps back from the edge, and the greasy-glass distortion thins, retreating down the first step where you can’t quite see it. The stairwell’s air pressure equalizes with an audible *whuff*.

He links the chain from your compass-spike toward the chalk threshold. The moment the last bead touches near your chalk line, the effect becomes continuous: the moving void that had been probing the corner simply… stops existing in that strip. Dust no longer creeps toward the bend. The powdering chalk at the corner settles.

You salt the corner thick with chalk dust. Your aching fingers leave faint gray smears on your skin; the cold ache deepens for a beat, then stabilizes—like the pain has found a comfortable seat in your knuckles.

Kest leans in just enough to answer without raising his voice. “Breath,” he says. “Not steps. Like something big learning to breathe through a keyhole.” He tilts his head, listening. “And—listen—there’s a second sound under the hiss.”

You all hear it then: a soft, rhythmic *tink… tink… tink…* from below, metal lightly striking stone. Not your pin (it’s back by you). Not the chain (it’s still).

The threat clarifies itself: whatever is down there has its own iron—or has found something metal—and it’s testing it against the stair, trying to understand the boundary you’ve made. The hiss returns, quieter now, threaded with irritation rather than hunger.

The wardens keep their eyes on the smear and the chain line. One gives you a tight, wordless nod: the iron edge is working—for the moment.

#### Turn 66 **[PLAYER]**

I hold up two fingers—silent—then point at the stair and mime “listening,” keeping everyone still. In a low whisper to Kest: “That *tink*—is it a loose nail like mine, or a longer scrape like a tool?” Then I gesture the wardens to use their boot-tips to lay the extra nails and buckle along any gaps in our iron line, and I mark our retreat path with a quick chalk arrow back from the stair so no one turns alone if it surges.

*Agent reasoning: The iron boundary is holding, but the entity is testing metal below; I should confirm what metal it has and reinforce without approaching the lip, while preparing an orderly retreat if the boundary fails.*

#### Turn 67 **[GAME]**

Everyone freezes on your two-finger signal. Even Kest stops breathing for a count, lips parted like he’s afraid the air will give him away.

The *tink… tink…* continues—steady, patient. You point, mime listening.

Kest angles his ear toward the stair and answers in a breath-thin whisper. “Tool,” he says. “Not a drop. It’s placed—lifted—placed. Like someone tapping the head of a nail to find hollow spots.” He swallows. “And it’s moving *up*, one tap at a time.”

You gesture the wardens to close the iron line. They obey with boot-tips: the three warding nails laid head-to-point in a staggered row where the rosary chain doesn’t quite meet your chalk; the cracked iron buckle set flat to bridge a handspan gap. As each piece of iron touches down, the shimmer you can’t quite see *recedes* a fraction, as if the stair-mouth is being pushed back by an invisible pressure.

Your chalk arrow goes down fast—sharp, practical—pointing the retreat route away from the lip. The chalk takes cleanly, and the arrow’s tip seems to “catch” the lanternlight, making it easy to follow even in the stairwell’s uneven glow.

Consequence: the tapping below changes immediately. It stops for two beats—listening—then resumes, but closer and faster, as if whoever (or whatever) is doing it has recognized you’re reinforcing a boundary and is hurrying.

Then a new sound joins it: a long, careful *scrrrk*—metal dragged lightly along brick—testing for an edge, a seam, a place where iron ends and chalk begins.

The threat is no longer just the shimmer at the lip. There is an **active presence below** using metal like a probe and advancing toward your threshold, apparently trying to **map your barrier by sound and touch**.

One of the wardens whispers, too loud despite himself, “That’s… that’s a hand down there.”

Kest’s response is immediate and physical: he tightens his grip on the satchel and shifts his stance behind the paired line, ready to backstep on your arrow without turning. “No one breaks,” he murmurs. “If it shows fingers, we don’t bargain with them.”

#### Turn 68 **[PLAYER]**

I exhale slow and whisper, “We don’t let it learn the line.” Then I flick a tight hand signal: lantern down and away—no light on the lip—and order, “Backstep on the arrow, paired, no turning; keep iron on the floor as we go.”  

As we retreat, I pinch and throw a last heavy scatter of chalk dust across the corner and any seam near the iron chain—like blinding grit—then murmur to Kest, “If it crosses the chalk anyway, we drop everything and run; but we do not split.”

*Agent reasoning: It’s probing for a gap and advancing; we should deny it information and avoid a close confrontation. Best is a controlled retreat while leaving a deterrent and keeping our paired formation intact, rather than waiting for it to touch the threshold.*

#### Turn 69 **[GAME]**

Kest snaps his lantern-hand down and angles the hood away from the stair-mouth. The light falls to your boots and the chalk arrow instead of the lip. The wardens follow suit—no one argues, just the quick, stiff obedience of people who’ve learned what “too much seeing” costs.

You all backstep on the arrow in pairs, shoulders nearly touching, never turning your backs. The iron stays on the floor: chain, nails, buckle—left behind as a low, ugly boundary.

Your last scatter of chalk dust goes thick across the corner and the seam by the rosary beads. It hits the stone like flour on wet hands; some of it clings, some of it skitters in a small white wave toward the threshold.

Immediate outcome: the *scrrrk* below falters. The probing metal drags once more, then stops, as if the grit has taken away the clean “edge” it was reading. The tapping resumes—but now it’s irregular, frustrated, searching for the line it just lost.

You’re three backsteps away when the lip answers anyway.

A shape rises into the dim—not the whole thing, just what it dares to extend: a **hand** made of soot-dark sinew and too-many joints, fingers thin as quills. It doesn’t breach the iron strip; it hovers just behind it, testing the air. Where your chalk dust hangs on the stone, the fingertips twitch and recoil, as if the powder stings.

Then it changes tactics. The hand hooks something metal from below—its own tool—and slides it forward *under* the iron line, trying to push it across without crossing itself.

The tool’s tip emerges: a long nail or awl, blackened, with a flattened head. It scratches at the chalk corner you salted, attempting to carve a clean channel through the powder.

Kest sees it and obeys your instruction to the letter—no heroics. “Back. Back—now,” he whispers, voice tight. The wardens backstep with you, paired, keeping formation.

Consequence: the iron boundary holds, but the presence below has learned it can **reach with a tool**. As you retreat, the scratching continues behind you, steady and methodical—trying to cut a path through chalk rather than cross iron.

No one splits. No one runs yet. But you can hear, clearly, that it’s working.

#### Turn 70 **[PLAYER]**

“Keep backing—same pace—don’t listen to the scratching,” I whisper, forcing my eyes to the chalk arrow and not the hand. “Next landing or doorframe, we make a hard stop.”

Once we reach the nearest junction, I have the wardens set their remaining iron (anything not already down) in a tight crescent across our side of the corridor, then I ask Kest, “Do we have wax, pitch, or oil? Something we can smear into a seam—chalk it, then seal it—so it can’t ‘cut a line’ clean.”

*Agent reasoning: It can’t cross iron but can use a tool to cut chalk; we need distance and a more permanent seal, plus information on what kind of entity uses iron probes. Retreat to a defensible junction, prepare to collapse/lock the stair, and avoid giving it time to “solve” the boundary.*

#### Turn 71 **[GAME]**

You keep the pace. You do not look back. The scratching becomes a kind of hateful metronome behind you, and for a moment it tries to match your retreat—as if it can measure distance by your footsteps—but you deny it that rhythm by keeping your backsteps even and quiet.

You reach the nearest junction: a low landing where the stairwell throat meets a side corridor of sweating brick. A doorframe sits there too—old oak banded in iron, swollen shut, its lock packed with candle-wax from some past attempt to sanctify it.

“Hard stop,” you whisper.

The two wardens move fast and low. Anything iron they still have goes down on *your* side of the corridor in a tight crescent: a short length of thorn-iron nail strip (meant for pinning ward-cloth), two loose nails, and a bent clasp pulled from one warden’s belt pouch. They set it so there’s no easy straight line to read—overlapping, staggered, ugly. The air near the crescent feels immediately less “slippery,” like the corridor has regained friction.

Kest keeps his body between you and the stair mouth while answering your question. He pats his own satchel once, then hisses a quiet curse. “No wax. No pitch.” He taps the lantern. “Oil, yes—lamp oil. But not much.” He nods toward the swollen door. “And there’s old wax in that lock… if you’re willing to pry it out.”

Behind you, from the stair throat, the scratching stops.

A beat later: *tink… tink… tink* again—closer than it should be if it stayed at the lip. Not in the corridor with you, but at the bend where the stair meets the junction, like it has advanced its tool-hand to the corner.

Then the metal-drag returns—soft, deliberate—this time not trying to cut your old chalk line, but **feeling along the brickwork at junction height**, searching for a new seam, a new “clean edge” to learn.

The threat is now clear: it can’t cross your iron, but it can **probe around it and attempt to establish a new line** at the junction. If it finds an unbroken seam to “read,” it may start cutting here instead.

#### Turn 72 **[PLAYER]**

“Quiet—no one steps past the crescent.” I crouch at the swollen door, keep my shoulder pressed to Kest’s side so we stay paired, and use the iron compass point to pry out a lump of the old wax from the lock. 

I smear the wax into the most obvious brick seam at junction height (the one the dragging seems to favor), then dust it heavily with chalk and press it flat with the side of my thumb to make it irregular and unreadable. “Kest—drip a *thread* of oil over this, just enough to slick it, not enough to run; wardens, keep your iron staggered and add chalk smears along any straight mortar line you can reach without breaking formation.”

*Agent reasoning: It’s probing for a new seam; we need to deny it clean edges and seal what we can without wasting oil. Wax from the lock is a ready sealant, and we should reinforce with chalk/iron while keeping formation and not getting too close to the bend.*

#### Turn 73 **[GAME]**

“No one past,” Kest echoes, and plants his boot heel against the nearest iron strip like he’s bracing a door. The wardens hold the crescent line, shoulders squared inward so nobody’s silhouette offers the stair throat a clean profile.

You crouch at the swollen oak door. The lock is crusted with old candle-wax—gray-yellow, grit-studded. With the iron compass point you lever at it. It doesn’t come free politely; it comes out in a stubborn plug that pops loose with a small, sharp *tck*.

At the junction height seam—where the metal-drag has been worrying the brick—you smear the wax hard into the mortar crack. It fills the groove and bulges unevenly. You dust it with chalk until it’s pale and thick, then press and scuff it with your thumb, flattening the surface into a lumpy, fingerprinted mess—no straight edge, no clean channel.

Outcome: the *scrrrk* from the stair throat stops almost immediately, as if the probing tool has lost the “readable” seam it was tracking. The tapping starts again—two quick taps, then a pause—like someone testing for resonance and getting none.

“Kest—oil,” you murmur.

He cracks the lantern’s oil cap with careful fingers and drips exactly what you asked for: a thin thread across the wax-chalk patch. It slicks the surface without running. The chalk darkens in a narrow, wet vein and clumps, turning granular and uneven. The seam becomes not just unreadable, but unpleasant to touch.

The wardens smear chalk along reachable straight mortar lines—quick palm swipes and thumb-scrapes—keeping their hips behind the crescent. One of them whispers, “Lines broken,” like a charm.

Consequence: the presence adapts again. The metal-drag resumes, but higher—along the *iron banding of the swollen door*—a slow, patient scrape as it searches for another clean boundary. Then you hear something worse: a faint, wet *sniff*—not a nose exactly, but air pulled through a narrow gap—sampling the corridor.

A thin black point—like the tip of that awl—edges into view at the corner, stops short of the crescent, and makes a tiny, precise scratch on the brick *above* your waxed seam.

It is testing new marks, trying to establish a fresh “line” where you haven’t fouled the surface yet.

#### Turn 74 **[PLAYER]**

“Don’t let it draw,” I whisper, and smear a rough palmful of chalk in a wide, messy oval over the fresh scratch and the brick above it—no straight strokes, just blotches. Then I take the remaining lock-wax and thumb it in uneven ridges along the door’s iron banding where it’s scraping, dusting that wax with chalk as well.  

To Kest, low: “How much corridor do we have behind us before the next junction—and is there a second exit or only back the way we came?”

*Agent reasoning: It’s trying to create a new clean reference line above our seal; I should deny it any straight, readable surface and avoid engaging directly. Also, the door’s iron banding is a new “edge” it can read—better to foul that too and consider a controlled withdrawal if it keeps adapting.*

#### Turn 75 **[GAME]**

Your chalk goes on like a bruise—wide, blotchy, no clean edge to follow. The fresh scratch disappears under a gritty oval, and the brick above it becomes a smeared field of fingerprint swirls and broken powder.

Immediate outcome: the awl-tip at the corner pauses. It makes one tentative, tiny *tick* against the chalked patch, then withdraws a hair’s breadth, as if the texture isn’t giving it anything consistent to “learn.”

You turn to the door’s iron banding where it’s been scraping and thumb the remaining lock-wax into uneven ridges along the metal—lumps, crescents, little torn peaks. You dust those ridges with chalk until the banding looks furred and diseased.

Consequence: the scrape on the iron banding stops. Not defeated—redirected. The metal-drag shifts to the adjacent brick again, searching for a new clean run.

Then the thing tries something you haven’t blocked yet: a soft, measured *tap… tap… tap* on the floor, just behind the corner—like it’s sounding for hollow space, for a gap under the brickwork where iron crescents don’t matter.

Kest answers without moving his feet, voice kept to the inside of your pairing. “Behind us—about twenty paces before the next junction. After that, it doglegs into the soot alleys.” He flicks two fingers toward the swollen door. “Second exit is *that*—if it opens. Otherwise it’s back the way we came.”

One of the wardens, still holding the crescent line, adds in a clipped whisper, “Door’s old clergy storage. Usually sealed from this side.”

As Kest speaks, the tapping on the floor becomes more certain, moving left to right in short increments, mapping the stones in front of your crescent as if it’s looking for the one that shifts.

Threat, clear: it can’t cross the iron crescent directly, but it may be trying to find (or create) a **gap from below**—a loose floorstone, a drain seam, anything it can use to bring its tool through on your side.

#### Turn 76 **[PLAYER]**

“Floor’s the next line—don’t give it a seam,” I whisper. I have the wardens smear chalk in broad, messy patches over the floor joints in front of the crescent (no straight runs), while I test the swollen door: palm flat for vibration, then a careful pull at the latch and a slow shoulder-press, listening for any give or hidden catch. “Kest—if it shifts a stone, call it; and tell me if you’ve got anything thin we can jam under a loose slab—knife, wedge, even a nail.”

*Agent reasoning: It’s shifting to the floor to bypass our crescent, so I need to deny it any predictable gap and avoid getting pinned here. The safest move is to keep formation, foul the floor seams with chalk, and try the door as a secondary escape without splitting the group.*

#### Turn 77 **[GAME]**

The wardens obey instantly, dropping to one knee without letting their torsos cross the crescent. They smear chalk in ugly, broad handprints over the floor joints just beyond the iron—no straight lines, no neat borders. The pale patches turn the stonework into a muddled map of palms and scuffs.

Outcome: the *tap… tap… tap* from the far side falters. Whatever is sounding the floor tests one chalk-smeared joint and gets only a gritty slide—no crisp seam to “count.” The tapping shifts a half-step away, searching for an unchalked gap.

You put your palm flat on the swollen door. The oak is cold-damp and faintly alive with vibration: not a heartbeat, more like pressure moving through old grain. When the distant bells toll above, the vibration sharpens—then eases—like the door is part of the cathedral’s breathing.

You try the latch. It has a catch—hidden, not locked. Your careful pull lifts it a fraction, then stops dead against swelling wood. When you shoulder-press slowly, the door gives you the smallest surrender: a thin *creak* and a breath of air from the other side that smells of old linen, ash, and dried incense.

But it’s not open. It’s *separated*—barely—by a finger’s width at the jamb before the wood binds again.

“Kest—if it shifts a stone, call it; and—”

Kest’s head snaps toward the floor. “Stone,” he says immediately.

A single slab just beyond the crescent—near the leftmost iron strip—twitches. Not lifting, not sliding out, but rocking as if something underneath has found purchase. A hairline of darkness appears at one edge, then vanishes when the slab settles back.

Kest fishes at his belt. “Knife—no. Wedge—no.” He yanks free a straight thorn-iron nail and holds it up between two fingers. “This. And a clasp pin.”

The threat is now specific and close: something below the floor is testing for a slab it can lever from *underneath*, trying to open a seam on your side of the crescent. If it gets even a fingertip-width gap, it can start “drawing” from below where your chalk smears can’t stop its tool.

#### Turn 78 **[PLAYER]**

I take the thorn-iron nail and, without crossing the crescent, hammer it down with the heel of my palm into the hairline gap at the slab’s edge the moment it twitches again—using it as a pin to stop any lift. “Clasp pin too—jam it beside, crosswise. If the stone moves, we drive both deeper.”

Then I lean to Kest, voice tight: “Help me—on three, we force the door. Slow pressure, no sudden swing.” I set my shoulder to the swollen oak again and breathe, listening for that hidden catch as I press: “One… two… three.”

*Agent reasoning: The floor slab is starting to give; I need to stop it from levering up from below while we still have formation. A quick pin/wedge and more iron contact should deny a gap, then we should use the barely-open door as a safer second route rather than risk the corridor.*

#### Turn 79 **[GAME]**

The slab twitches again—left edge this time, a sharper rock like something below has found a better lever.

You drop the thorn-iron nail into the hairline the instant it opens and drive it down with the heel of your palm. It bites with a gritty *crunch*—stone grit, mortar dust—then seats hard. The slab tries to lift and can’t; the movement turns into a frustrated tremor that rattles through the floor into your knees.

“Pin,” Kest breathes, approval clipped. He slides the bent clasp pin into the same edge, crosswise, and you both shove it down together. The pin doesn’t go deep—too bent—but it wedges, catching the nail and turning the edge into a bristling, ugly little trap.

Consequence: whatever is underneath changes tactics. The pressure shifts away from the pinned edge and you feel—through the soles of your boots—a series of small, searching pushes along the neighboring joints, as if it’s looking for an easier slab to worry.

You lean into Kest. “On three.”

He comes in close on your right, shoulder to wood, careful not to break the crescent line with his feet. The wardens tighten their crescent, chalky hands hovering over the floor joints like they’re ready to smear again at any new twitch.

“One… two… three.”

You both apply slow, steady pressure. The swollen oak complains—long, reluctant creaks—and the hidden catch you felt earlier gives way with a muted *clack* that you hear more than feel.

The door opens a handspan.

Not a room—an inky, narrow storage passage. Linen-wrapped bundles stacked too high. A saint’s niche inside, face turned to the wall as if in shame. And a draft that runs *upward*, toward the bells, carrying the dry-sweet stink of incense and something coppery under it.

Immediate danger: as the gap widens, the metal-drag behind the corner stops. In its place comes a thin, eager *scrape*—not on the floor now, but on the **threshold** of the storage passage, like whatever is out there has realized you’re making a new line it can reach.

Kest freezes mid-push. “It heard that,” he murmurs. “Keep it controlled.”

At your feet, the pinned slab shudders once—then goes still. The pressure underneath has moved.

Something is now repositioning to reach the new opening you’ve created.

#### Turn 80 **[PLAYER]**

“Hold—don’t open it further yet,” I whisper, then smear chalk in a thick, ugly band across the threshold and the doorjamb as far in as I can reach without crossing the crescent, scuffing it with my thumb to break any straight edge. “Warden—eyes on the floor joints; call the first twitch.”

To Kest, low: “Do we have cloth or cord? If we can’t seal it, we at least leash the door so it can’t swing wide—then we peek for a second exit or a place to set iron inside.”

*Agent reasoning: Opening the door created a new “clean line” at the threshold; I need to foul that line before widening the gap, and avoid stepping through until we know what’s inside and whether the thing can reach around. I’ll also keep the iron crescent intact and have someone watch the floor for a new lift point.*

#### Turn 81 **[GAME]**

You stop the door with your forearm and smear chalk across the threshold—thick, ugly, thumb-scuffed. You drag the chalk up the jamb as far as you can reach without stepping over the crescent, breaking any straight run into blotches and torn arcs.

Outcome: the thin *scrape* that had started on the threshold stutters, then shifts to a hesitant, searching rasp along the outer edge of the door—like a blade trying to find a clean line to “take.” It doesn’t find one immediately.

The nearer warden plants his palm on the floor and watches the joints like a hawk. “I’ve got it,” he whispers.

Kest answers your question by ripping a strip of cloth from inside his cloak—lining or bandage, you can’t tell—and produces a length of thin cord that had been tied around a wax-sealed packet at his belt. “Cloth and cord,” he says. “Not much.”

As he speaks, the floor gives a warning you can feel before it’s seen: a faint, rising pressure under the chalk-smeared stones to your right—*not* the pinned slab. The watching warden snaps, “Twitch—right joint!”

A seam two stones over from your nail-pinned slab lifts a hair, enough to exhale a thread of dust. Something below is trying a new point—probing for the first unpinned edge it can lever.

Inside the storage passage, beyond the half-open door, the saint’s niche makes a dry, granular sound—as if grit is sliding in its throat. The statue’s turned head doesn’t move, but a whisper leaks out anyway, faint through the crack: “Eir… wen…”

Threats, clear and immediate:
- Below-floor pressure is relocating and testing other slabs for a lift.
- The thing outside is now feeling along the door’s edge, looking for a clean threshold line to catch.
- The half-open door is an invitation; if it swings wider uncontrolled, you’ll give it a bigger surface to work.

Kest keeps his voice low, already looping cord around the door handle. “I can leash it to the iron ring on the jamb. But you’ll have to decide—do we commit inside, or do we shut it and reinforce the floor first?”

#### Turn 82 **[PLAYER]**

“Kest—leash it. Short, so it can’t swing wider than a handspan.”

I grab the strip of cloth, wad it, and shove it into the twitching right joint as a grimy plug, then smear chalk over it to foul the seam; if it lifts again, I drive the clasp pin into that edge too. Without stepping past the crescent, I angle my lantern low and take a careful peek through the crack—just enough to spot an inner iron hook, ring, or any second way out.

*Agent reasoning: The floor threat is actively relocating, so we need immediate stabilization; the half-open door is also a liability unless leashed. Committing inside blind is risky, but a controlled peek could reveal an inner iron anchor or second exit. Secure the door first, then pin the new slab, then take a minimal look inside without breaking formation.*

#### Turn 83 **[GAME]**

Kest nods once and works fast. He loops the thin cord through the door’s inner handle (caught through the crack with two fingers) and cinches it back to an iron ring set into the jamb on your side. He ties it off short—when the door tries to ease wider under its own swell, the cord catches and holds it at roughly a handspan. The oak shudders against the leash and stops.

You wad the strip of cloth and cram it into the twitching right joint. It goes in with resistance—grit and old mortar bite your knuckles—then seats. You smear chalk over it, thumb-scuffing hard to foul the seam.

Outcome: the seam stops “breathing” dust. The pressure from below tests once, meets cloth and chalk, and withdraws—at least for the moment.

But the floor doesn’t go quiet. Two joints farther along—closer to the wall—give a faint, synchronized *tick* as if something under there has shifted its weight sideways, hunting for a seam you haven’t plugged.

You keep the clasp pin ready, then angle your lantern low and peek through the handspan crack.

Inside the clergy storage passage: bundles of linen and votive cloth stacked tight; a narrow walkway; and, immediately to the right just inside, an iron wall-hook with a looped chain—meant for hanging censers or securing a door. Farther in, you spot a second exit: not a door, but a low service hatch near the floor at the passage’s end, its edges blackened with soot like it opens into the alleys or a chimney-run.

As your lanternlight crawls across the saint’s niche, you see why the statue faces the wall: its mouth has been stitched shut with thin wire, but the wire is slack—as if it’s been worried at from the inside. The whisper still leaks through, grit-soft: “Map…maker…”

Immediate threat: from the outer hall (your side), the earlier metal-drag returns—closer now—and something hard taps the **door edge** just above your chalk smear, testing the wood itself since the threshold line is fouled. One, two taps—then a slow scraping climb, like a hooked tool feeling for the cord.

Kest’s eyes flick to the leash. “It’s looking for the tie,” he says, voice flat. “If it cuts that cord, the door’s going to spring.”

#### Turn 84 **[PLAYER]**

“Kest—switch the leash to that chain inside, now. Keep the gap the same; don’t let the door spring.”  

I smear fresh chalk thick over the cord and knot area to foul any clean cut, then reach in through the crack as far as I safely can and try to snag the looped chain onto the inner handle or hook so the door’s held by iron instead of cord. “Warden—cover those two ticking joints with blotch-chalk; if either lifts, I’ll pin it.”

*Agent reasoning: The cord is a vulnerability; if it’s cut, the door may fly open and give the thing a clean line. I should replace the leash with something it can’t easily sever and keep fouling seams as it searches.*

#### Turn 85 **[GAME]**

Kest moves the instant you say it—one hand braced on the door so it can’t surge, the other working the cord’s knot. “Hold it steady,” he mutters, and leans his weight into the oak to keep the gap fixed at a handspan.

You smear fresh chalk over the cord and knot, turning the tie-point into a gummy, broken-edged mess. The scraping outside pauses when it hits the chalked cord—then resumes higher, choosing wood over fiber.

You reach in through the crack, shoulder burning as you keep your boots behind the crescent. Your fingers find the iron looped chain on the wall-hook just inside. It’s heavier than it looked, cold and greasy with old incense soot. You drag it off the hook link by link, trying not to clink it.

It clinks anyway—one small, traitorous *tink*.

Inside the passage, the wire-sewn saint exhales a sound like sand in a throat. The whisper sharpens, closer than it should be: “Don’t…unhook…me.”

Kest hisses, “Ignore it.”

You manage to snake the chain toward the inner handle. The first attempt slips—your fingertips skid on the greasy links—and the chain drops, striking the stone floor inside with a dull *chank*.

Immediate consequence: the two “ticking” floor joints behind you answer as if they heard a cue. Both lift a hair at once—enough to spit dust. The watching warden blots chalk over them fast, palm-smearing ugly circles. “They’re up—barely!”

At the door edge, the hooked scraping finds the cord at last. There’s a sharp *twang* as something catches and pulls. The door jerks against Kest’s brace; the cord holds, but it’s under tension now—one good slice away from failure.

You try again with the chain, teeth clenched. This time you get a link over the inner handle, then another—enough that the chain takes some of the load. You feel the door’s pressure shift: less on the cord, more on iron.

Kest doesn’t relax. “Chain’s on,” he confirms, eyes on the leash point. “But it’s not anchored yet—if that hook outside yanks hard, it’ll still rip the handle or drag the chain loose.”

In the outer hall, whatever is there changes rhythm: no more delicate scraping. A firm, deliberate pull tests the door—once—then again, stronger, like it’s realized you’re trying to make the opening *permanent*.

The threat is clear: the cord may snap or be cut, and the chain—only half-seated—could be torn free, letting the door spring wide. Meanwhile, the floor joints you just blotted are “awake,” responding to sound and movement with coordinated lifts.

#### Turn 86 **[PLAYER]**

“Kest—keep bracing. Wardens, silence—no more kneeling shuffles; just chalk if it lifts.”

I hook more chain over the inner handle, then try to draw the chain back out through the crack and loop it around the jamb ring on our side, so the door’s leashed by iron-to-iron; if it won’t reach, I tie the cord to the chain as a sacrificial link and keep smearing chalk over any exposed cut-line. “If it yanks again, we let it take cord—not the door.”

*Agent reasoning: The door is about to be forced; the cord is a weak point. I need an all-iron restraint anchored to something solid without stepping past the crescent, and I should minimize noise to keep the floor-thing from coordinating. The saint’s whisper is a possible lure—ignore for now.*

#### Turn 87 **[GAME]**

Kest’s shoulder locks harder into the oak. He doesn’t answer—just shifts his feet so the door can’t surge even if the leash fails.

The wardens go statue-still. One stays crouched with chalk ready, but he stops scraping his knee across the stone. The other keeps his palm hovering over the blotted joints, eyes flicking between seams.

You hook more chain over the inner handle until it sits like a rough collar. Then you start feeding it back toward you through the crack.

Outcome: it *won’t* come.

The chain is fixed to the wall-hook inside. You’d pulled it off the hook’s lip, but it’s still threaded through the hook’s loop—like a tether meant to keep whatever it secures from being carried away. When you tug, it bites and holds. The links grind against iron and stone, loud in the narrow passage.

The stitched-mouth saint makes a dry, pleased sound. Not a whisper this time—almost a soft laugh through teeth that shouldn’t move.

Outside, whatever’s on the other side of the door reacts to the grinding: the careful pulls stop. Something changes angle and **rams** the door once—testing your brace. The cord snaps taut with a squeal under the chalk smear; fibers protest but don’t part. The door shudders, but Kest keeps the gap at a handspan.

Your “sacrificial link” idea becomes the only workable version: you tie the cord to a free section of chain you can reach (as close to the handle as your fingers allow), knotting cord around iron links. You smear chalk over the cord where it crosses the door edge, turning it into a paste-slick lump.

Outcome: the leash is now **shared**—cord takes the cutting, chain takes the yanking. The door no longer loads entirely onto the cord.

Consequence: your knot and chalk smear create a thick ridge at the door edge. The hooked tool outside catches that ridge and **saws** at it—chalk flakes snow down, and you hear cord fibers start to fuzz.

Behind you, one of the blotted floor joints lifts again—only a hair, but enough to *click* against the chalk crust. The crouched warden slaps fresh blotch-chalk over it without shifting his knees.

Immediate threats, now clearly defined:
- The thing outside is actively sawing at the cord where it meets the door edge; you have seconds-to-minutes before it parts.
- The chain is anchored inside and can’t be pulled free; if the door is forced wider, the handle could tear or the chain could whip.
- The floor seams are responding to vibration; another loud grind or impact may make more slabs “wake” at once.

“Kest—hold it exactly there. Don’t let it give an inch.”

I stop feeding chalk onto the cord and instead work my fingers through the crack to lift the cord up and *off* the door edge, trying to reposition it so the saw-hook can’t bite—then I whisper, “I’m going to take the cord off entirely if I can.”

Keeping my boots behind the crescent, I reach in and try to re-seat the chain onto the **wall-hook** and then around the **inner handle** in a way that makes a short iron loop that holds the door at a handspan without any cord crossing the edge. “Warden—if any joint lifts more than a hair, call it; I’ll pin the first one that moves.”

*Agent reasoning: The cord is about to be cut; the safest move is to remove the cord from the door-edge entirely and let the chain take the load, but the chain needs a better anchor point inside. I should minimize noise/vibration to avoid waking more slabs, and avoid opening the door further. I’ll use the chain to “lock” the door at this narrow gap by shifting its attachment point so it doesn’t cross the edge where the hook is sawing, and have the wardens ready to pin any lifting joints.*

#### Turn 89 **[GAME]**

Kest grunts—confirmation—and plants his forearm across the door like a bar. The handspan gap stays fixed, trembling under his weight.

You get two fingers onto the cord where it rides the door edge and peel it up, trying to lift it out of the hooked tool’s reach. The chalk paste makes it slippery; the cord shifts… and the sawing outside immediately follows the movement, scraping higher like it can *feel* the tension line.

Then it hooks the cord cleanly.

A hard jerk from the other side yanks the cord down across the edge again. The fibers rasp once—sharp as tearing cloth—

—and the cord **parts**.

For half a heartbeat the door tries to spring wider. Kest catches it with his whole shoulder and a boot heel braced against the threshold. The gap widens maybe a finger, no more, then holds—Kest shaking with the strain.

You don’t have time to mourn the cord. You reach in and work the chain.

Up close, you see the wall-hook inside isn’t just a hook: it’s a **ring-bolt** set into the stone, with the chain permanently captive through it. That’s why it wouldn’t come out. You can’t “re-seat” it so much as choose how it’s routed.

You thread the chain tighter around the inner handle, then back toward the ring-bolt, shortening it link by link. Your fingertips burn as the links grind. You find a link that will catch on the ring-bolt’s lip and you **jam** it there—making a crude iron loop that holds the door at roughly the same handspan.

Outcome: the door is now leashed by **iron only**. No cord crosses the edge anymore.

Consequence: the moment the cord snaps, the hooked tool outside loses its purchase and switches tactics. Metal scrapes the door seam, searching for a gap to pry. The sound is louder than before.

The blotted floor joint nearest the wall lifts more than a hair—enough that you see a thin black line open and a puff of old dust breathe out.

The crouched warden finally speaks, tight and low: “Joint—two fingers from the wall. It’s opening.”

From inside the passage, the stitched-mouth saint’s wire twitches. The whisper comes out pressed flat, like someone speaking through fabric: “Iron…holds…until it doesn’t.”

And outside the door, the prying stops.

Something heavy settles its weight against the oak—quiet, patient pressure—followed by a soft, deliberate **tap** directly on the latch-side, as if it’s measuring where to break you next.

#### Turn 90 **[PLAYER]**

“Good—keep the door leashed and quiet. No one breathes loud.”

I drop to the wall-side seam the warden called and, staying behind the crescent, drive my clasp pin into the opening edge at a slight angle to bite both stones; then I smear blotch-chalk over the joint and my own knuckles to break any clean line. “Kest, on the next tap—don’t fight it with strength. Let it take the chain’s slack, not the latch. I want to see that service hatch—can you angle your light inside without widening the gap?”

*Agent reasoning: The door is temporarily controlled by iron, but the floor seam is actively opening and the outside pressure is shifting to a breaking tactic. I should stabilize the floor first with a pin before anything rises, keep noise down, and avoid committing through the crescent until we have a safer fallback via the service hatch.*

#### Turn 91 **[GAME]**

You drop to the wall-side seam. The crack is breathing dust now—thin, black, and cold against your fingertips. Staying behind the crescent, you slide the bent clasp pin into the opening at a slant and hammer it in with the heel of your hand.

Outcome: the pin bites. Stone grinds on metal, and the seam’s lift stalls—held at a hairline instead of widening. When you smear blotch-chalk over it, the chalk cakes into the crack and around the pin head, making the joint look like an unbroken, ugly smear instead of a clean line.

Consequence: the pressure that *would* have lifted that slab doesn’t vanish. It shifts. Two spans farther down the wall, another seam answers with a faint *tick*—not opening yet, but awake.

You wipe chalk over your knuckles; the grit stings in the raw places, but it does dull the shine of skin and sweat.

At the door, Kest holds his position and nods once without looking away. He slides his lantern-hand lower and angles the shuttered light through the handspan gap without widening it.

You get a brief, clear look into the clergy storage passage:
- The wall-hook you used is a ring-bolt set into stone ribs, chain looped tight to the inner handle as you left it.
- The passage runs straight for several paces, then angles left where shelving throws hard shadows.
- At the far end, near the floor, you catch the edge of the **low service hatch**—a rectangular iron-framed door, its bottom rim crusted with candle-fat and soot. It’s shut.

Before you can study it longer, the heavy weight outside the door shifts.

A **tap** comes—exactly where you predicted—on the latch-side. Kest obeys: he doesn’t muscle against it. He lets the chain take a fraction of slack.

Outcome: the door gives the tiniest controlled shiver, held by iron. The latch doesn’t pop.

Consequence: the chain answers with a sharp *clink* inside the passage—small, but loud in this tight geometry.

The saint-statue inside reacts immediately. Not words—an intake of grit, like a throat clearing. The sound carries down the passage toward the hatch.

Then, from somewhere beyond your lantern’s reach inside, you hear a quiet, answering sound from low to the ground: a **metal fingernail scrape** along the iron frame of the service hatch, as if something on the other side just woke up and put a hand on it.

Threat, now: whatever is outside the main door is coordinating with something inside the passage—something near or behind the service hatch that is responding to sound and vibration.

#### Turn 92 **[PLAYER]**

I press two fingers to Kest’s wrist to still the lantern and whisper, “No more chain clinks—wrap it with cloth if you have any.” Then I lean close to the crack and, keeping my voice barely there, murmur toward the stitched saint, “What are you guarding—hatch or door? Answer with one word.” Finally, I motion a warden forward on hands and knees to slide a chalk-marked pebble (not metal) into the passage—just far enough to reflect lanternlight off the floor toward the service hatch so I can see if it’s moving without stepping over the crescent.

*Agent reasoning: Two threats are coordinating; I need more information without making noise. The hatch entity reacts to vibration, so I should reduce sound, keep the door stable, and scout the hatch visually if possible before committing to entering.*

#### Turn 93 **[GAME]**

Your fingers still Kest’s lantern wrist. The light steadies to a thin, controlled blade through the gap.

Kest doesn’t speak. He shifts his free hand to his belt, fishes out a grimy strip of wrap (old bandage or scarf), and—careful not to jostle the door—reaches as far as he can to wind it around the chain where it meets the inner handle. He can’t reach the ring-bolt, but he mutes the worst of the handle-links. The next tiny door tremor gives only a dull *thud*, not a clink.

You lean toward the crack and murmur to the stitched-mouth saint.

For a moment there’s nothing—then the statue’s wire-stitch twitches, and a single word pushes out, scraped and definite:

“**Hatch.**”

The crouched warden you gesture to goes down on hands and knees without argument. He pinches a small stone from the grit at the threshold, rolls it in chalk until it’s pale, then slides it into the passage with two fingers—slow, deliberate, keeping his hand behind the crescent line.

Outcome: the pebble skitters a foot, then settles. In the lantern’s low angle, it throws a faint reflected glow along the floor toward the far end.

You can see the service hatch more clearly now. It is shut—*but* the soot crust along its bottom rim isn’t intact. A thin line has been freshly disturbed, like something has been dragging a nail or fingertip back and forth in the grit.

Then the hatch’s iron frame gives a tiny inward flex—barely a millimeter—followed by a second, more purposeful scrape from behind it.

Consequence: the sound is quiet, but it’s answered immediately from outside your main door: a slow, satisfied **tap… tap** on the latch-side, as if the thing out there is keeping time with whatever is behind the hatch.

Threat made plain: there is something behind the service hatch testing it from the inside, and something outside your door coordinating pressure and rhythm. If the hatch opens while the door is being timed, you could be caught between two points of entry—one behind your crescent and one in front of it.

The warden freezes on his knees, eyes wide, whispering without looking back: “It moved.”

#### Turn 94 **[PLAYER]**

“Back—slow, no scrape,” I hiss to the kneeling warden, guiding him to retreat the way he came.  

I whisper to Kest, “If it taps, you give it a hair of slack—nothing more; keep it quiet.” Then, staying behind the crescent, I take blotch-chalk and dust it in a thin trail toward the crack—watching the hatch line for any change—while murmuring to the stitched saint, “How do I *bind* it—salt, iron, or silence?”

*Agent reasoning: We’re at risk of a pincer—door pressure timed with hatch movement—so I need to buy time by stopping the hatch without making noise, while keeping everyone behind the crescent and minimizing vibrations.*

#### Turn 95 **[GAME]**

The kneeling warden eases back exactly as told—palms flat, knees sliding, boots never touching down until he’s clear of the crescent. He keeps his belt and scabbard from dragging. The chalked pebble stays where it is inside the passage.

Outside the door: **tap**.

Kest obeys. He gives the door a hair of slack—chain taking it, not latch—so gently the cloth-wrapped links only make a soft, muffled knock. His jaw is clenched hard enough to show white at the corners.

You dust blotch-chalk in a thin trail toward the crack, careful not to cross the crescent. The powder hangs for a heartbeat in the lantern’s sliver, then settles.

Outcome: the chalk trail makes the air’s movement visible. It doesn’t drift toward the door seam; it drifts **toward the wall-side crack** you pinned—like something is sipping breath through stone.

At the far end, by the reflected glow, the service hatch line changes: the disturbed soot at the bottom rim trembles, and a fresh, narrow furrow appears—one slow drag, left to right—like a fingertip tracing a boundary. The hatch doesn’t open, but something behind it is now moving with intent, not just waking.

You murmur your question to the stitched saint.

The wire-stitch twitches twice, then the statue answers with a single word that comes out like grit through teeth:

“**Silence.**”

Consequence: the moment the saint speaks, the door outside answers with a firmer pressure—no tap, just weight settling shoulder-first into oak. The leashed chain holds, but the door bows a fraction inward and stays there, straining.

And from the passage beyond, you hear it: a small, wet click—like a tongue against iron—from behind the service hatch, followed by a faint, testing exhale that makes the chalk on your trail shiver.

Threat, now explicit: whatever is behind the hatch is using sound and breath as a guide. Every spoken word and every scrape is a beacon; the more noise you make, the more precisely it “finds” the seams to worry open.

#### Turn 96 **[PLAYER]**

I clamp my lips shut and raise a flat palm to everyone—*no sound*—then point two fingers at my eyes and the pinned wall seam, circling once to warn it’s drawing breath. I press blotch-chalk into my own spit to make a thick paste and slowly smear it over the pinned crack and its edges to choke the airflow, then lay my gloved hand over it to hold pressure and feel for movement.  

Without speaking, I tap Kest’s forearm twice—*hold steady, no slack unless tapped*—and gesture the wardens to freeze and breathe through cloth, eyes on the hatch line and my chalk trail.

*Agent reasoning: Silence is the binding; speaking and scraping are guiding it. The chalk shows it’s pulling through the pinned seam, so we need to stop airflow and vibration without making noise, and avoid giving the hatch more cues. I’ll signal instead of talk, seal the seam with chalk paste, and have Kest hold steady—no slack unless tapped.*

#### Turn 97 **[GAME]**

Silence drops in like a held breath.

Kest understands your two taps. He plants his boots, shoulders square to the chained door, lantern locked in the same narrow angle. One warden presses his sleeve over his mouth and nose; the other pinches cloth from his collar and does the same. No one speaks. No one shifts more than they must.

You work spit into blotch-chalk until it becomes a dark, gritty paste. When you smear it over the pinned crack, it goes on tacky and thick, bridging the hairline gap and feathering out over the stone like a crude sealant. You press your gloved hand flat over it and hold.

Outcome: the draft through the crack weakens immediately. The chalk trail you laid no longer trembles toward that seam; the powder lies still, settling where it fell.

Under your glove, you feel the stone’s “breathing” change—less like a sip, more like pressure building behind a stopped throat. The pinned seam gives a faint, steady push against your palm, testing for a weak edge.

At the far end of the passage, in the pebble’s reflected glow, the service hatch’s disturbed soot line hesitates. The fresh furrow stops growing. For several long seconds, nothing moves.

Then consequence: the pressure you choked at the wall seam seeks another path.

A thin, pale thread of your loose chalk powder begins to drift—not toward the pinned crack now, but toward the **door gap** where Kest’s lantern shines. It’s subtle, but it’s a new airflow: the room is being pulled, gently, toward the chained door.

Outside, there is no tap. No scrape. Just a slow increase of weight against the oak—enough that the chain cloth creaks softly, not metal-on-metal but fabric tightening.

Inside the passage, behind the service hatch, you feel it more than hear it: a low, careful **inhale** through iron, as if something is drawing scent through the frame. The hatch itself doesn’t open—yet—but the bottom rim’s soot lifts in a tiny ripple, like a breath passing under it.

Threat made clear: by sealing the wall seam, you’ve redirected the “breath-path.” Whatever is hunting by airflow and sound is now orienting on the **door gap** and the **hatch rim**—and the outside presence is pressing silently, trying to force the door to give in a single, quiet surge rather than taps that warn you.

#### Turn 98 **[PLAYER]**

I press two fingers to my lips again—silence—then point at the door gap and mime “seal.” Keeping behind the crescent, I smear a thick ribbon of blotch-chalk paste along the threshold seam nearest the gap (as far as I can reach) to blunt the airflow, then sprinkle a faint, dry chalk line in front of the door and watch for drift.  

I grip Kest’s sleeve and guide his stance a half-step—hips lower, shoulder angle—so he’s bracing *down* into the floor instead of bowing the door inward, and I tap once, slow: hold. Finally, I gesture a warden to keep his eyes on the service hatch soot line and the chalked pebble—if it so much as ripples again, he signals with two finger taps on his own knee.

*Agent reasoning: The airflow is now pulling toward the door gap and hatch rim; we need to deny it “breath” and avoid noise. I’ll try to seal the door gap without breaking the crescent, and have Kest redistribute pressure so the chain doesn’t creak or slip. I also want eyes on the hatch without approaching it, using chalk as a tell.*

#### Turn 99 **[GAME]**

You signal *seal* and move without a word.

Still behind the crescent, you reach as far as you safely can and smear a thick ribbon of blotch-chalk paste along the threshold seam nearest the door gap. The paste catches on grit and old wax, building into a lumpy berm that bridges the worst of the hairline space.

Outcome: the faint chalk you sprinkle in front of the door no longer streams straight toward the gap. For a few heartbeats it lies almost still—then it begins to drift sideways in a thin, reluctant curl, as if the pull is weaker but searching for any unsealed edge along the jamb.

You take Kest’s sleeve and shift him a half-step, lowering his hips and turning his shoulder so his weight drives down into the floor rather than levering the door inward. He follows your hands precisely. When you tap once—*hold*—he goes statue-still.

Consequence at the door: the oak’s inward bow lessens by a fraction. The chain stops “singing” through cloth. But the outside pressure doesn’t leave; it *settles*—patient, heavy, listening for give.

At the passage end, you assign the warden to watch the hatch. He nods once, eyes fixed on the soot line and the chalked pebble.

Then the hatch answers.

Not opening—worse: the soot at the bottom rim lifts in a tight, shallow ripple, like a breath pushed out under the edge. The chalked pebble doesn’t move, but the reflected glow on the floor flickers as something passes close behind it, blocking and unblocking the lantern’s sliver.

The watching warden gives two finger taps against his knee—soft, controlled.

Threat made clear: something behind the service hatch is now moving along the inside of it, “feeling” the rim with breath. And whatever is outside the main door has stopped tapping entirely—it’s applying steady, silent force, waiting for a moment when your attention shifts and the door can surge without warning.

#### Turn 100 **[PLAYER]**

I hold up a clenched fist—freeze—then silently point: warden-on-hatch stays; the other warden comes to me, slow, and offers me his driest cloth. I wrap the cloth into a soft plug and, without crossing the crescent, press it hard into the door-gap’s most pulling edge under my chalk berm to deaden any remaining airflow.  

Then, still silent, I take a pinch of dry chalk and dust a thin crescent-shaped “tell” line on the floor aimed toward the service hatch’s bottom rim, watching for any breath-ripple; if it stirs, I gesture Kest and both wardens to lower their bodies further and hold their breath in staggered turns, no panicked gasps.

*Agent reasoning: Silence is the binding, so I need to keep everyone quiet while I stop the airflow cues at both the door and hatch. If I can’t fully seal, I should misdirect the “breath-feeler” with a controlled draft and buy time rather than force an opening.*

#### Turn 101 **[GAME]**

Your clenched fist locks them in place.

The warden you beckon moves like he’s wading through glass—one slow step, then another—keeping his boots inside the safe scuffs you’ve already made. He peels off the driest strip he can manage from under his outer cloak: rough linen, chalk-dusted, barely damp at the edges from breath. He doesn’t speak; he just holds it out.

You roll it into a soft plug and press it under your chalk berm at the door’s most “hungry” edge. It takes force—your glove squeaks faintly on the paste—but the cloth seats into the seam.

**Outcome:** the chalk you’d sprinkled near the door stops curling toward the gap. The powder settles flat. The door is no longer “drinking” air from the room.

**Immediate consequence:** the outside weight reacts to the change. Not by leaving—by *testing*. The oak bows in a small, controlled pulse inward, then relaxes, like someone outside leaned in with their whole shoulder and then eased off. The chain snaps tight against the cloth wrap with a dull, muffled *thunk*. Kest absorbs it by dropping his center of gravity exactly as you indicated. He doesn’t lose ground.

At the far end, you dust your thin crescent-shaped tell line aimed at the service hatch’s bottom rim.

For two breaths, nothing disturbs it.

Then the tell line shivers—fine grains hopping in place—followed by a visible, narrow sweep where the chalk thins as if a tiny current is being pulled **under the hatch**, not out. The soot at the hatch’s bottom edge lifts and *streams inward* in a faint, smoky ribbon.

**Threat, now explicit:** whatever is behind the service hatch has changed tactics. It’s no longer just “sniffing” along the rim—it’s drawing air hard enough to create a measurable pull, like a mouth sealed to a keyhole.

The watching warden taps his knee twice again, sharper this time.

You gesture everyone lower and into staggered breath-holds.

Kest drops first, cheek close to his shoulder, breath pinched off. The hatch-watcher follows a heartbeat later. The other warden tries to time his inhale and—despite the cloth—lets out a tiny, involuntary *snick* through his nose.

The service hatch answers instantly: a wet click from behind the iron, and the bottom edge lifts a hair’s breadth—just enough that the soot line breaks cleanly in one spot.

It doesn’t swing open yet. But a thin, dark seam appears at the bottom corner, widening by a fingernail.

#### Turn 102 **[PLAYER]**

I hold up two fingers, then point at the hatch seam and mime “stuff/plug,” then beckon the nearest warden to crawl forward *slowly* with his cloth over his mouth. Using the remaining dry linen, I twist a long, soft cord and, staying behind the crescent, slide it along the floor toward the service hatch to jam under that lifting corner—no metal, no scraping—then press down with the flat of my gloved hand on the floor to seat it.  

Without speaking, I tap Kest’s forearm twice—*expect a shove*—and point at the chain, then the floor, signaling him to keep all force downward and still.

*Agent reasoning: The saint warned “silence,” and the hatch reacts to even tiny sounds; we need to stop airflow and sound at the hatch before it opens further, without crossing the crescent or making metal noise. A soft seal and pressure against the hatch seam is safest, while keeping Kest braced for a sudden push at the door.*

#### Turn 103 **[GAME]**

Two fingers up. *Two beats.* Stuff the seam.

The nearest warden— the one not posted on the hatch—drops to his belly and begins to crawl, cloth clamped over his mouth. He moves slow enough that his belt doesn’t scrape, palms placed carefully, knees sliding in short pulls. His eyes never leave the soot-break at the hatch corner.

You twist the remaining dry linen into a long, soft cord—more rope than plug—and feed it forward along the floor. It glides over the grit with only a faint whisper, disappearing into the dim toward the hatch’s lifted corner.

**Outcome:** the linen cord reaches the gap. When you press down with the flat of your gloved hand (still behind your crescent), the cord bunches and **seats under the lifting corner**, stuffing the seam. The hatch corner drops back down a fraction—enough that the visible dark line narrows to almost nothing.

For half a second, the “pull” under the hatch falters. Your tell-line stops shivering.

Then the consequence hits: whatever is behind the hatch doesn’t give up—it **bites the plug**.

The cord jerks, not outward, but *sideways* as if something hooked it from the other side and dragged. The linen fibers tighten and go taut along the floor, trembling in small, fast pulses. The hatch corner lifts again—this time fighting the jam—raising just enough to **pinch the cord hard**.

You hear a wet, satisfied little sound from behind the iron—like lips peeling from cloth.

The crawling warden freezes mid-pull, eyes wide, cloth still over his face. He doesn’t signal with taps; he’s too close and too scared to risk sound.

At the door, you tap Kest’s forearm twice—*expect a shove*—and point chain, then floor.

Kest answers with action, not words: he drops even lower, shoulder set, weight driving straight down through his legs. A heartbeat later the outside presence tests again—one strong, silent surge. The door bows inward a finger’s width and stops. The chain goes bar-tight with a dull, muffled *thud* against its cloth wrap. Kest holds.

**Threat, clear and immediate:** something behind the service hatch is now **actively pulling on the linen jam** and trying to lever the corner open while it feeds on the airflow you’ve denied elsewhere. If it gets a grip enough to yank the cord free—or if the cord tears—it will have a clean gap to work with, and the crawling warden is within arm’s reach of that corner.

#### Turn 104 **[PLAYER]**

I snap two fingers in the air—*back, now*—and wave the crawling warden to reverse-crawl away, fast but silent, cloth still over his mouth. Staying behind the crescent, I ease my pressure off the linen cord to give it slack, then smear a fresh, thick wad of blotch-chalk paste in a low mound aimed right under the hatch corner so the cord can sink into it and lose any “handle” shape.  

With my other hand I motion the hatch-watching warden to slide his boot sole flat on the floor (no lift) and gently pin the cord down a pace away from the hatch—just enough to stop it feeding in—then I point at his knee: two taps if the corner lifts again.

*Agent reasoning: The thing is using the linen as a handle; if it can pull, it can open. I need to deny it purchase without making noise, and get the crawling warden out of reach. Best is to slacken the cord so it can’t tension, then trap the hatch corner shut with weight/paste while we retreat.*

#### Turn 105 **[GAME]**

Your two-finger snap cuts through the hush like a knife.

The crawling warden obeys instantly. He reverse-crawls fast—heels digging, elbows pulling—still keeping the cloth over his mouth. It isn’t graceful, but it’s silent. He clears the danger zone by a body-length, then another, until he’s back within the “shadow” of your crescent and Kest’s braced bulk.

You ease off your pressure on the linen cord. The moment it slackens, it doesn’t just relax—it **twitches**, as if something on the far side noticed the loss of resistance and tested for a free pull. The hatch corner lifts a hair again, searching.

You smear a fresh, thick mound of blotch-chalk paste low to the floor, right where the cord disappears under that corner. The paste goes down heavy and sticky, gritty with ash. You work it into a shallow berm that *swallows* the cord’s profile.

**Outcome:** the cord loses its clean “line.” Instead of a taut handle, it becomes a lumpy, paste-coated strand half embedded in chalk-muck. The next sideways tug from behind the hatch turns into a dull, frustrated *drag*—the paste grips and resists, and the cord no longer slides cleanly.

You motion the hatch-watching warden. He doesn’t lift his boot; he slides it flat, sole whispering over grit, and pins the cord down a pace back from the hatch—just enough to stop it feeding inward.

**Immediate consequence:** whatever is behind the hatch pulls again and meets the pinned section. The cord goes taut, then vibrates in short, angry pulses—like a hooked fish on a line that can’t run. The hatch corner lifts to the thickness of a coin and stalls, held by the cord jam and the paste berm.

From behind the iron comes a wet, scraping sound—something rubbing along the underside of the hatch, trying to find purchase around your paste. A thin smear of soot snakes outward from the corner, then stops as the paste catches it.

The hatch-watching warden keeps his weight steady. He gives you **two controlled taps** on his knee.

At the door, the outside pressure shifts again—another careful shove. The oak bows, stops, and the chain thuds once into its wrap. Kest stays planted, driving down, face tight but silent.

**Threat, now:** you’ve bought time, but you can feel the situation tightening: the hatch corner is still capable of lifting slightly, and something behind it is actively working the seam, testing your paste and cord for a weak point—while the force outside the main door continues its steady, patient pressure, waiting for any lapse.

#### Turn 106 **[PLAYER]**

I hold up three fingers—*three beats*—and silently gesture Kest and both wardens to rotate breath on my count: one inhales while the others hold, then switch, no shared gasp. Staying behind the crescent, I dust a thin blotch-chalk ring around the hatch corner (outside the paste) and score a quick sigil-notch in it with my nail—an “itch-mark” that should twitch if something pushes through.  

Then I point at the pinned cord under the warden’s boot and mime *cut*—I draw two fingers across my palm—then shake my head: *not yet*; instead I press my palm flat to the floor and slowly slide it toward the hatch, feeling for vibration patterns through the stone, trying to map whether the pulling is a mouth, a hook, or something jointed.

*Agent reasoning: Two fronts are pressuring us; I need to reduce openings and learn what we’re dealing with without making sound. Best is to reinforce the hatch seal and create a warning/warding pattern, while keeping everyone steady and preventing panic.*

#### Turn 107 **[GAME]**

Three fingers up: three beats.

Kest understands first. He nods once and sets the rhythm with his shoulders—one slow inhale while the others lock their throats and noses, then a clean switch. The wardens follow, faces tight, cloth still covering mouths. No shared gasp. The room’s air stops “fluttering” with panic-breath, and the hatch’s corner stops reacting to stray drafts.

You dust a thin blotch-chalk ring around the hatch corner, careful to keep it outside the paste berm. The chalk settles in a clean circle—then you score a tiny sigil-notch with your nail: the itch-mark.

**Outcome:** the itch-mark holds steady at first—no twitch, no smear.

You mime *cut* at the cord under the boot, then shake your head: *not yet*. The hatch-watching warden’s eyes flick to the cord and back to you; he keeps his sole pinned, pressure even, no lift.

You lay your palm flat to the stone and slide it forward, slow as a prayer, feeling through your glove and the floor’s cold grit.

**What you feel:** not a single, steady pull like a mouth drinking air. It’s patterned—**two quick tugs, a pause, then a longer drag**, repeating. Between those pulses there’s a faint, granular vibration—like something with **small joints** flexing against iron, searching for purchase. A hook, or several hooked digits, not lips.

As your hand nears the paste berm, the vibration sharpens into a scratchy tremor that travels up your wrist. The cord twitches in sympathy under the warden’s boot.

Then the itch-mark reacts.

The chalk notch gives a tiny, involuntary **flick**—a visible twitch—and a thin line cracks outward from it, like a hairline fracture in dried clay.

**Threat made clear:** something on the far side has found a way to **press at the seam without fully lifting it**—probing with jointed pressure right at the corner, close enough to disturb your ring.

At the door, the outside force stops shoving and changes behavior: a soft, deliberate scrape along the oak—slow, side-to-side—like someone feeling for the chain’s anchor point. The wrapped chain gives a faint, complaining creak.

Kest doesn’t look back. He shifts his hands lower and drives his weight down harder, exactly as you signaled earlier—still, vertical force only.

The hatch-watching warden gives you **two taps** on his knee again, but this time he adds a third, hesitant tap—an improvised warning: the corner isn’t just lifting; it’s *working*.

The cord remains pinned and the corner remains mostly closed, but you can tell from the vibration pattern: whatever’s behind that hatch is **learning** how your jam behaves.

#### Turn 108 **[PLAYER]**

I press two fingers to my own eyes then point at the door-scrape, then the chain wrap—asking Kest with a glance if he feels the anchor shifting—then I signal the free warden to creep to the chain-side *inside* our crescent and brace the chain’s wall-anchor point with his shoulder low (downward force only), no touching the door.  

For the hatch, I sprinkle a second, wider blotch-chalk tell arc a handspan out from the corner and set three tiny grit-stones on it as “jumpers,” then I smear a thin slick of paste over the exposed cord segment just *before* the pinned boot so it can’t be hooked cleanly. Finally, I hold up one finger—wait—and keep my palm on the floor to feel for the next tug pattern before we decide whether to cut the cord.

*Agent reasoning: Two threats are adapting at once: the door is searching for the chain’s anchor, and the hatch creature is “learning” the jam. I need more early-warning tells and redundancy without making noise or giving it a clean handle; also I should reposition resources and ask a quick, silent status check.*

#### Turn 109 **[GAME]**

Kest answers your glance without turning his head. His jaw works once, then he gives you a tight, downward nod: **yes**—he can feel the chain’s anchor complaining.

The scrape outside shifts from side-to-side to *upward*, testing height—like hands or a tool searching for the point where the chain meets the wall-hook. The wrapped chain creaks again, and this time you hear a faint, gritty *tick* from the iron loop in the wall, as if it’s being torqued.

You signal the free warden to move. He creeps along the inside edge of your crescent, keeping low, then plants his shoulder under the chain’s line—**bracing the wall-anchor point with downward force only**, careful not to touch the door. He sets his feet and leans in, turning himself into a wedge against the hook’s pull.

**Outcome at the door:** the next outside test—an upward jerk—meets resistance. The chain still snaps tight, but the wall-hook doesn’t give that ticking complaint this time. The pressure transfers into the warden’s shoulder; he winces, silent, and holds.

At the hatch you lay your second tell: a wider blotch-chalk arc, a handspan out, and you place three tiny grit-stones along it like jumpers. Then you slick paste over the exposed cord segment just before the pinned boot.

**Outcome at the hatch:** the cord’s surface becomes tacky and dull; it no longer offers a clean edge to snag. The grit-stones sit still—until your “one finger—wait” coincides with the next test.

Your palm on the floor catches it first: **two quick tugs, pause—then three shorter, alternating pulls**, like something trying different angles. The cord vibrates under the boot. One grit-stone **jumps**—a tiny hop inward—then settles. A second stone trembles but doesn’t move.

Then the seam answers with a new problem: a thin, dark **thread**—not cord, not chalk—worms out from under the hatch corner and touches the paste-slicked cord segment. It doesn’t hook; it **presses**, flattening itself like a finger-pad, and you feel the vibration change: the jointed thing is testing *adhesion*, not grip.

**Threat, explicit:** whatever’s behind the hatch has switched tactics. It’s no longer just pulling on the cord; it’s extending something through the coin-thin gap to **make contact** with your materials and learn how to defeat them—while the force outside the door continues probing the chain and anchor for a failure point.

No one speaks. The only sounds are the wrapped chain’s quiet strain and the wet, deliberate rub of that dark thread against paste.

#### Turn 110 **[PLAYER]**

I hold up a closed fist—still—then pinch two fingers and mime *burn/itch* at the hatch corner; I dust a tight sprinkle of dry blotch-chalk directly onto the dark thread and the seam (no new cloth), then draw a tiny barbed crescent over the paste berm with my nail—meant to “sting” anything that presses through.  

I glance to Kest and quietly mouth, “If the hook pops, we drop flat—don’t catch the door,” then gesture the bracing warden to keep his shoulder down and slide his feet wider for purchase.  

Keeping my palm on the stone, I wait one more tug cycle, watching the grit-stones and the itch-mark for any stronger push before deciding whether to cut the cord.

*Agent reasoning: The “thread” probing the paste could be a sensory appendage; I want to blind/ward it without giving it more material to learn, and I need contingency if the door anchor fails. I’ll add a reactive chalk trap at the hatch corner and quietly prepare an exit plan while keeping forces downward.*

#### Turn 112 **[PLAYER]**

I hold up a closed fist—still—then pinch two fingers and mime *burn/itch* at the hatch corner; I dust a tight sprinkle of dry blotch-chalk directly onto the dark thread and the seam and scratch a tiny barbed crescent over the paste berm with my nail to sting anything that presses through.  

I glance to Kest and quietly mouth, “If the hook pops, we drop flat—don’t catch the door,” then gesture the bracing warden to keep his shoulder down and slide his feet wider for purchase.  

Palm still on the stone, I wait one more tug cycle, watching the grit-stones and itch-mark for any stronger push before deciding whether to cut the cord.

*Agent reasoning: Something’s probing through the hatch; I want to sting it and get a clear tell without provoking a full breach. The door anchor is also being tested, so I’ll warn Kest and stabilize the brace while I read the next tug cycle before committing to cutting the cord.*

#### Turn 114 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my fist raised for *still* and hold position, eyes on the hatch corner and the chain line. “I’m not seeing the next beat—what changed on the hatch and the door just now?”

*Agent reasoning: There’s no new text from the game, so I should pause, keep the team steady, and ask for the missing scene update before committing to a risky action like cutting the cord.*

#### Turn 115 **[GAME]**

Your raised fist freezes everyone.

**What changed at the hatch (because of your chalk and “sting” mark):**  
The dark thread that had been pressing at the corner **touches the dusted blotch-chalk**—and the chalk reacts like it found heat. It doesn’t flare; it **pales and clumps**, turning from powder to tiny, damp beads. Where it beads, the thread **twitches back a hair** as if it felt pain, then tries again from a slightly different angle.

When it presses into your **barbed crescent scratched over the paste berm**, there’s a clear effect: the thread **catches for a fraction of a second**, then **peels away**, leaving behind a faint **smear the color of old soot and bruised ink** on the paste. The seam itself **widens by a sliver**—not enough for a hand, but enough that you can now see a **thin line of darkness** that wasn’t visible before. Something on the other side is applying steady pressure, not just tugging.

Your grit-stones confirm it: the stone nearest the corner **slides a fingertip’s width** toward the seam, then stops. That’s not vibration anymore—that’s the floor shifting under a push.

**What changed at the door (because of your warning and the brace adjusting):**  
Kest gives you a sharp, silent nod and lowers his center of gravity, one hand hovering near his own knees like he’s ready to drop.

The bracing warden follows your gesture: he **spreads his feet wider** and sinks his shoulder down. The next outside test comes—an **upward wrench**—and the chain snaps tight. This time the wall-hook answers with a **metallic groan** (not the earlier tick), and the warden grunts through clenched teeth but holds.

Then you hear the real change: from the other side of the door, a **new sound joins the scrape**—a short, deliberate **tap-tap** against the door’s lower panel, like someone has switched from pulling to **checking for give** at the hinge line.

**The threat, plainly:**  
Whatever is at the hatch is now **pushing to widen the seam**, and whatever is at the door has stopped merely testing the chain and is **probing the door itself** for a weak point—while your brace is buying time, not certainty.

#### Turn 116 **[PLAYER]**

I swallow and whisper, “It’s learning,” then signal the hatch warden to keep the boot pinned while I slide my knife in flat and *score* the cord just behind the paste-slick—half-cut only, ready to sever on my hand sign.  

I dust a narrow line of blotch-chalk straight across the visible darkness at the seam and press my thumbnail into it three times—quick “saint’s teeth”—to make any further widening sting harder.  

To Kest I murmur, “Door’s testing hinges—listen for a shift,” and I gesture the bracing warden to tuck his free hand under the hook line (not touching metal) to catch *wall crumble* only, then I hold up two fingers: *on my count, if the hook groans again, we drop flat.*

*Agent reasoning: Two pressure points are escalating; I need to slow the hatch push without opening it, and keep the door from becoming the next breach. Cutting the cord could remove their leverage, but it might also free something—so I’ll prep a safer cut and add a warding bite at the seam while reinforcing the door plan.*

#### Turn 117 **[GAME]**

The hatch warden keeps his boot pinned hard enough that his calf trembles. He doesn’t look at you—just grits his teeth and bears down.

You slide your knife in flat and **score the cord** just behind the paste-slick. The blade bites clean—**half the fibers part**, and the cord immediately changes tone: it stops feeling like a taut line and starts feeling like a **held breath**. The paste shifts slightly where the cord runs under it, a thin glossy ripple like something beneath the stone flinched.

You lay a **narrow line of blotch-chalk across the seam’s darkness**. The moment the chalk bridges that gap, it **sweats**—tiny beads form again, faster than before. When you press your thumbnail in three quick “saint’s teeth,” the chalk dents hold.

Then the seam tries you.

A **steady push** comes from the other side—stronger than the earlier probing. The hatch corner lifts a hair, and your chalk line **fizzes into a pale scab**, clinging to the edge. The “saint’s teeth” dents **darken**, as if bruised from underneath. A thin, dark filament touches the chalk—**it jerks back sharply**, leaving a smear like bruised ink. The seam does **not** widen further; instead the pressure shifts sideways, searching along the edge for a place your chalk isn’t.

At the door, Kest tilts his head, listening. “Hinge-side,” he breathes, barely audible.

The bracing warden follows your gesture and slides his free hand under the hook line without touching the chain. On the next test—**a hard, downward yank**—the hook gives that **metallic groan** again. Dust sifts from the mortar above the hook and sprinkles into his palm. He hisses, “Wall’s shedding.”

And then: a new sound from the door—wood fibers **crackling** low near the hinge, like something is trying to **worry the pins out** rather than pull the door open.

The immediate threat is now split and coordinated: **pressure at the hatch is searching for an unwarded edge**, while **the door-side force is working the hinge line to make the chain irrelevant**. The wall around the hook has started to crumble; one more heavy groan could mean the hook tears free instead of the chain snapping.

#### Turn 118 **[PLAYER]**

I hiss, “Secondary anchor—now,” and point the free warden to loop his belt/strap around the chain and a solid fixture (table leg/pipe/anything fixed) to take load off the crumbling hook without touching the door.  

To the hatch warden: “Hold—if it surges, I cut,” and I keep my knife poised at the half-scored cord, eyes on the seam’s searching edge; with my other hand I dust a quick, thin chalk trace along the *new* edge it’s probing to close the gap in our coverage.  

To Kest, barely audible: “If the hinge pops, we drop flat and slide left—away from the swing,” and I watch the door’s hinge-side crackle for the next decisive shift.

*Agent reasoning: The hook is failing and the hinge is being targeted; we need a safer anchor and to deny the hinge line, while keeping the hatch from finding a weak edge. I’ll prioritize reinforcing the hook with a secondary wrap and ready a controlled cord sever to stop the hatch pressure if it surges.*

#### Turn 119 **[GAME]**

The free warden snaps into motion at your “Secondary anchor—now.” He yanks his belt free with one hand while keeping his shoulder braced to the chain with the other, then threads the belt **through a chain link** and around the nearest fixed thing that isn’t the door: a thick **iron wall-pipe** that feeds down into the floor beside the storage racks. He cinches it hard—leather squeals, buckle bites.

It works, but not cleanly. When the next pull hits the door, the chain jerks and the load **shares**: the hook still groans, but less; the pipe takes a sudden bite of tension and **shivers**, making the racks rattle. The warden grunts, “It’ll hold—unless the pipe comes loose.”

At the hatch, the boot-pinning warden holds as ordered. The seam’s pressure shifts to the new edge it was hunting; you dust your quick thin chalk trace there, and for a heartbeat the searching filament **halts**, then touches the fresh line—

—and **snaps back** like it struck nettles. The chalk beads and scabs immediately. The seam stops trying to widen at that point and instead begins a **slow, patient scrape** along the underside of the hatch lip, as if it’s testing for any place your chalk didn’t reach.

Your knife stays poised at the half-scored cord. The cord trembles once under your blade—just a tiny vibration—like something on the other side noticed it exists.

Kest, at the door, angles his body left, ready to drop. He whispers, “Good. Hinge-side is the play.”

Then the decisive shift comes: the crackle at the hinge deepens into a sharp **pop**—not the door opening, but a hinge pin **lifting** a fraction. The door doesn’t swing yet because the chain and belt-anchor catch it, but the whole slab **tilts** a hair toward the room, enough to make the chain clatter and the belt creak.

The threat is now immediate and specific: **one more hinge-pop** and the door will start to **swing inward on a skew**, potentially ripping the weakened hook free; at the same time, the hatch-thing has switched to **scraping under the lip**, looking for an unchalked bite-point while your cord sits half-cut, ready to become either a snare or a severed release.

#### Turn 120 **[PLAYER]**

“Wedge it—hinge side, low!” I signal Kest and the free warden to slam a crate board or metal bar into the bottom hinge gap to stop any inward swing, then I tell the bracing warden, “Ease the hook—let the belt take more, slow.”

Without lifting my eyes long from the hatch seam, I scrape a quick crescent of blotch-chalk along the hatch lip where it’s scraping, then murmur to the boot-pinning warden, “If you feel it bite up, shout—no heroics.”

Knife still poised at the half-cut cord, I raise two fingers to Kest—counting the next hinge-pop—and brace to sever the cord the instant the hatch surges or the door starts to swing.

*Agent reasoning: The door hinge is about to give; we need to prevent a swinging breach and reduce load on the failing hook. The hatch threat is probing for a gap, but it’s currently deterred by chalk—keep it pinned while I prioritize the imminent door failure. I’ll add a wedge at the hinge-side, then prepare to sever the cord as an emergency release if the hatch surges.*

#### Turn 122 **[PLAYER]**

I freeze with my knife still poised and two fingers raised, then whisper, “I didn’t see the last beat—what exactly happened at the door and the hatch just now? Any new sounds, movement, or damage?”

*Agent reasoning: I need immediate feedback—blank prompt means I’m missing the scene update; as a cautious player I’ll halt and ask for clarification before committing to a move that could trigger the hinge or hatch.*

#### Turn 123 **[GAME]**

You hold perfectly still—knife hovering at the half-scored cord, two fingers raised. In that pause, the room gives you the missing beat.

**At the door:**  
The chain gives a small, involuntary **tink-tink** as tension settles into the belt looped around the iron wall-pipe. The door itself is no longer rattling randomly; it’s being **levered**. You hear wood complain in a slow, twisting way—**a steady torque**, not a yank. Then a clean, metallic sound: **the bottom hinge pin lifts another hair** with a faint **scritch**, like metal sliding against metal under pressure. The door edge nudges inward a fraction—barely a finger’s width—but enough to make the belt creak and the racks shiver. The hook’s mortar sheds again: a soft **grit-rain** onto the bracing warden’s sleeve.

Kest murmurs without turning his head, “It’s walking the hinge pins up. Not trying to break the chain—trying to make it irrelevant.”

**At the hatch:**  
The scraping you’d heard becomes more precise. Something thin and hard is **raking the underside of the hatch lip** in short strokes, testing the same spot repeatedly. Each stroke makes a dry, almost polite sound—**tap-scrape… tap-scrape**—as if it’s using a fingernail or a shard. Your chalk line along the seam is holding, but it’s being **worried**: the edge of the chalk has started to **flake** where the scraping concentrates, leaving tiny pale crumbs that immediately go damp.

The boot-pinning warden swallows and whispers, “It’s right under my heel. I feel it… pressing up, like it wants the bone.”

And the cord under your knife gives a second, clearer tremor—followed by a faint, wet **click** from beneath the hatch, as though something just touched the cord’s cut fibers and recognized the weakness.

No new NPCs enter; no one has moved positions. The immediate threats are now explicit: **the door is being turned into a swinging lever by lifting hinge pins**, and **the hatch-thing is concentrating on one lip point, flaking your chalk while probing your half-cut cord.**

#### Turn 124 **[PLAYER]**

“Door first—stop the pin.” I whisper to Kest, nodding at the lowest hinge. “Jam iron under the hinge knuckle or drive something through the pin-head gap—anything to keep it from walking up; stay left of the swing.”

To the boot-pinning warden I hiss, “Shift your weight back an inch—don’t lift, just un-bone it,” and as he eases, I press a thick smear of paste and blotch-chalk right onto the scraped lip point, then carve a tight crescent over it with my nail. “If it surges, I cut—shout the instant you feel teeth.”

*Agent reasoning: The door threat is hinge pins walking up—wedge/pin them down without getting near the swing. The hatch is about to bite the boot and exploit the half-cut cord; I should either fully sever at the right moment or reinforce the lip with a stronger ward while keeping the warden safe.*

#### Turn 125 **[GAME]**

Kest moves on your whisper without argument—low, fast, staying left of the door’s potential arc. He drops to a knee by the **bottom hinge**, fingers probing for purchase. “Pin’s proud,” he mutters.

He doesn’t have a proper punch. He uses what he has: the **bent clasp pin** you took off him earlier is still in your kit, not his—so he improvises with the environment. He snatches a thin **iron splinter** from the wall-hook’s mounting plate where the mortar has been shedding, then tries to wedge it into the tiny gap at the hinge pin head.

It **bites**—for half a breath. Then the door’s invisible leverage increases, and the hinge answers with a sharp, ugly **CHIRK**. The iron splinter shoots out and skitters across the floor. Kest jerks his hand back, knuckles grazed. “No. It’s too clean. Needs a real stop.”

The good news: that failed wedge costs the door a moment. The bad: the hinge pin still **walks**. You hear the soft **scritch** again—another fraction up.

At the hatch, the boot-pinning warden does exactly what you said: he shifts his weight back **a careful inch**, heel never fully lifting. The pressure change is immediate. Something beneath the hatch **follows** his retreat, pressing up harder at the lip point you’ve been fighting—testing whether he’s about to lose contact.

You slap your thick smear of paste and blotch-chalk onto the scraped point and carve your tight crescent with your nail. The paste takes, and the crescent-line **seals** with a sticky, matte finish.

For a heartbeat, the tap-scrape stops.

Then—**teeth**. Not metaphorical. A thin, hard edge pushes up under the lip and **shaves** at the fresh crescent. It can’t pierce through in one go, but it starts **planing** the paste away in deliberate strokes. The warden’s voice goes tight: “It’s—ah—there. Right there. It’s chewing the line.”

And the half-cut cord under your knife goes taut, as if something below has hooked it and is testing how little force it takes to make you finish the cut.

Immediate threats, clear:
- The **bottom hinge pin is still rising**; Kest failed to jam it with scrap iron and needs a sturdier stop fast.
- The hatch-thing has shifted from probing to **actively shaving your fresh seal**, while simultaneously **tensioning the cord** you’re poised to sever.

“Kest—take my clasp pin, now. Use it as a punch—drive that hinge pin *down* and then jam it.” I toss/slide the bent clasp pin to him without looking away from the hatch.

To the free warden: “Find a spike—nail, chisel, anything—and a mallet; if not, use a boot-heel. We need the pin seated and something wedged under the knuckle.”

I lean my weight onto the hatch edge with my forearm (careful not to give it clearance), keep the knife steady but *don’t* finish the cut, and hiss to the boot warden, “Hold the heel—if it bites up hard, shout and I sever.”

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is actively working the seal and baiting me into cutting the cord; if I cut at the wrong moment it could release something. The door hinge pin walking is a simpler mechanical failure—if it swings, we lose control. Give Kest the proper tool (my clasp pin) and stabilize the hinge with a hard stop, while I keep the hatch contained and avoid finishing the cut unless it surges.*

I keep the knife hovering at the half-cut cord, lean my weight steady on the hatch, and hiss to the boot-pinning warden, “Don’t lift—just hold. If it bites up hard, shout and I sever.”

The bent clasp pin skitters across the stone and comes to rest against Kest’s knee. He snatches it up without looking, turns it in his fingers once, then plants its bent end against the **bottom hinge pin’s head** like a crude punch.

He can’t swing hard—too tight, too close to the door—so he uses the heel of his palm and a sharp downward shove.

**Clack.** The hinge pin drops a fraction—enough that you hear the door’s levering force complain and reset. For the first time in minutes, the door stops “walking” upward and instead **settles** into its frame.

Kest immediately tries to “jam the knuckle” by forcing the clasp pin’s bend into the hinge seam. It doesn’t fit cleanly; the bend is wrong. He curses under his breath and instead **wedges the clasp pin flat** between hinge plates as best he can—an ugly, partial shim.

It works—kind of. The hinge pin is seated, but the shim is under strain. The door answers with a slow, grinding **creak** as whatever’s outside tests the new resistance. The chain holds. The hook holds. But the hinge now emits a rhythmic **tick… tick… tick** as metal flexes.

The free warden sprints to the storage racks, yanks open a drawer, and comes up with a **thorn-iron warding nail** and a short **wooden mallet** used for setting chalk-lines. He rushes back, breath hissing, and drops to Kest’s side. “Got a nail. Got a setter.”

At the hatch, your forearm pressure keeps the edge from giving clearance. The shaving sound changes: the thing beneath stops planing the paste and instead presses up in a single, hard surge—testing your weight.

The boot-pinning warden stiffens. “It’s pushing—hard—” His heel trembles but doesn’t lift.

The half-cut cord goes taut again—tighter than before—like something has hooked it with intent. You feel the knife edge *want* to finish the cut with the smallest pull.

Kest barks, low: “Hold. If that door swings, it’ll take my fingers. Warden—nail under the hinge, now.”

The threat is immediate and specific:
- The **door** is temporarily stopped, but the clasp-pin shim is flexing; if it slips, the hinge pin can start walking again and the door may swing.
- The **hatch-thing** has switched from shaving to **full upward pressure** and is **tensioning your cord**, trying to force your hand into severing.

#### Turn 130 **[PLAYER]**

“Drive the thorn-nail under the hinge knuckle—low and deep. Two taps, check, two taps. Don’t shatter the plate.” I call, voice tight, still bearing down on the hatch with my forearm.

To Kest: “Once it bites, pull your fingers clear—let the nail carry it; keep left of swing.”

I hiss to the boot warden, “Lock your knee—breathe shallow. If it bites up hard or you feel it hook your heel, shout ‘TEETH’ and I cut—otherwise I’m not giving it the cord.”

*Agent reasoning: The door hinge is the immediate catastrophic failure point; a proper nail wedge will stabilize it. The hatch-thing is trying to trick me into cutting the cord, so I must keep pressure and only sever if it truly surges. I’ll coordinate both fronts without shifting my weight.*

#### Turn 131 **[GAME]**

The free warden slides the thorn-iron nail to the hinge, point angled into the narrow gap beneath the **lower knuckle**, exactly where the plates meet. He raises the wooden mallet.

Kest jerks his hand away from the hinge seam at your warning and flattens himself left of the door’s swing-line, shoulder braced against the wall.

**Tap. Tap.** The nail bites with a gritty squeal—thorn-iron scraping iron. The door gives a tiny, unwilling **shift** inward as the nail starts to take load.

The warden pauses, checks the set with two fingers, then does it again.

**Tap. Tap.** The nail drives deeper. The hinge plate doesn’t shatter, but it does **dish**—a shallow dent forming where the nail is forcing itself in. The rhythm of the hinge’s flexing tick changes to a harsher, slower **clunk… clunk**, like the door is now resting on the nail’s spine.

Outside the door, whatever pressure had been testing it answers with a sudden **shove**—not enough to rip the chain or hook free, but enough to make the nail scream and the mallet-hand warden flinch.

The nail holds. The hinge pin stays seated. The door doesn’t swing.

But the consequence is immediate: the nail has become a lever-point. Each shove makes it **work** against the hinge plate, widening the dent. It’s a temporary brace, not a permanent fix.

At the hatch, the thing beneath responds to your refusal to cut by changing tactics: you feel a quick, precise **hooking tug** at the boot warden’s heel—like a claw catching the edge of his sole.

He gasps and his voice cracks, loud despite himself: “TEETH—!”

The hatch lip surges up hard against your forearm at the same time. Your weight keeps it from opening, but the force is enough that your elbow skids a finger’s breadth on the stone. The half-cut cord snaps even tighter, vibrating against your knife like a plucked string—something below is pulling it *down* while pushing the hatch *up*, trying to turn you into a hinge.

Kest, eyes flicking from door to hatch, spits: “It’s got his boot. If he lifts, it’ll take the hatch with it.”

Clear threats now:
- The hatch-thing has **hooked the boot warden’s heel** and is trying to force a lift.
- The cord is under active pull; if you cut, you may free the boot—but you’ll also give the thing whatever the cord is tied to below.

#### Turn 132 **[PLAYER]**

“Don’t lift—Kest, grab his belt and shoulder, pin him down. Warden, get both hands on his thigh—anchor him.”  

I slide my knee onto the hatch edge beside my forearm to add weight, then smear paste thick around the boot’s heel seam and the hatch lip, chalking a tight slick ring. “On my count, twist your heel *inward*—don’t pull up. One… two… now.”

*Agent reasoning: Cutting the cord is what it wants; I need another way to free the boot while keeping the hatch pinned. I’ll redistribute weight onto the hatch with my body, have Kest and the free warden physically anchor the boot warden, and use paste/chalk as a lubricant/ward to slip the hooked claw off the heel.*

#### Turn 133 **[GAME]**

Kest moves instantly—one hand clamps the warden’s belt, the other hooks under his shoulder and drives him *down* into the stone so his leg can’t reflexively lift. The free warden drops both hands onto the pinned man’s thigh, forearms locked like a brace.

You shift your knee onto the hatch edge beside your forearm. The hatch answers with a muffled **thump** from below as the pressure redistributes; it doesn’t gain ground, but it doesn’t lose interest either.

You smear the paste thick—heel seam, hatch lip—then chalk a tight ring. The chalk hisses faintly where it meets the paste, as if the mixture is drinking it. The slick ring forms a greasy boundary that immediately changes the feel of the tug: the hooked pull at the heel becomes less “sure,” more skittering.

“One… two… now.”

The boot warden twists his heel **inward**.

There’s a sharp, wet **scrape**—like something with teeth losing purchase on leather. For a heartbeat it feels like it’s going to catch again, and then the hook **slips**.

The warden’s boot jerks, but Kest and the other warden keep him pinned; no lift, no upward give. The hatch surges in anger—hard enough to jar your knee—then stalls under your combined weight.

From the gap around the boot, something pale and jointed—two finger-length **barbs**—rakes blindly, smearing paste and chalk into streaks. One barb catches the boot’s outer edge and tears off a **small strip of leather**, but doesn’t re-hook the heel.

The immediate outcome: the heel is **free of the hook**, and the hatch stays shut.

The consequence: the thing below has found the paste-ring’s edge and is now **scratching at it**, testing where the slick ends. Each rake makes a dry, chalk-eating sound, and the cord beneath your knife gives a sudden, deliberate **downward jerk**—not enough to snap it, but enough to warn you it’s still being held.

Kest, teeth bared, keeps the warden pinned. “Heel’s clear. Don’t you move.”

The boot warden is breathing in short, panicked pulls, but he hasn’t lost his foot. Yet.

No new items change hands.

#### Turn 134 **[PLAYER]**

“Good—now we *withdraw* slow.” I murmur, keeping my weight on the hatch. “Kest, inch him back on his seat—drag, don’t lift his boot.”

To the free warden: “More paste—pack the ring wider, feather it out; then chalk over, make it a broad slick, not a line.” I press my palm down to smear the edge outward while keeping the knife hovering over the cord. “If it jerks again, I cut only on my word—no surprises.”

Without looking up, I call toward the door, “Someone check that thorn-nail—if it’s walking or the plate’s dishing more, tell me *now*.”

*Agent reasoning: The heel is free but the barbs are now working at the edge of my paste-ring; I need to reinforce the seal and reduce openings without cutting the cord unless there’s no other choice. Also, I should get the pinned warden fully away from the hatch while we still have control, and check the door brace isn’t failing.*

#### Turn 135 **[GAME]**

Kest nods once—no words—and shifts his grip so the boot warden’s weight stays on his backside and hip. He drags him an inch at a time, belt and shoulder doing the work. The pinned warden grits his teeth and lets himself be hauled, keeping his boot flat to the stone.

It works at first: leather scrapes, paste smears, and the boot slides back a handspan without lifting. The pale barbs under the hatch rake after it, skittering on the slick you’ve made—more frustrated than effective.

The free warden scoops more paste from the bucket and does as told: he **packs the ring wider**, then feathers it outward. You press your palm down and smear the edge into a broad, greasy halo. Chalk goes over it in a fast, tight oval. The broad slick changes the thing’s purchase again; the scratching turns to a rapid, harmless **scrabble**.

Then the cord gives a sharp **double-jerk**—down, down—like a signal.

The hatch answers with a coordinated push, not a surge: pressure comes up in a steady, rising force that makes your forearm burn and your knee bite stone. The slick holds, but you feel the hatch edge begin to **creep** a hair’s breadth—enough that the paste at the lip wrinkles.

Kest snarls, “Hold it—hold it—”

At the door, the warden who’d been working the hatch flicks his gaze over his shoulder as you call for a check. His eyes widen.

“The thorn-nail’s—” he starts, and then the door shudders under another shove from outside. The thorn-iron nail doesn’t pop, but the hinge plate **dishes further**, and the nail visibly **walks** a fraction outward with a metallic squeal.

“—walking!” he finishes, voice tight. “Plate’s deforming. If it backs out, the hinge’ll go with it!”

Immediate threats, now simultaneous:
- The hatch is beginning to **creep open** under sustained pressure; your weight is barely holding it, and the cord is being actively worked.
- The thorn-nail brace at the door is **slipping outward** as the hinge plate deforms; a few more heavy shoves could free the hinge enough for the door to start swinging again.

#### Turn 136 **[PLAYER]**

“Kest—stay on him. Free warden, get the mallet and *drive that thorn-nail back in* before it walks out; then set something—anything—crosswise as a keeper so it can’t back out again.”

I shift my weight lower, planting my second knee on the hatch edge and leaning my shoulder in. “Someone—slide a chisel, nail, even a belt buckle under the hatch lip on *my* side; we need a hard stop.”

I keep the knife poised but don’t cut. “If the hatch gains a finger’s width, I cut on ‘NOW’—not before. Door-man: tell me the moment that hinge starts to free.”

*Agent reasoning: Two failures at once; I can’t abandon the hatch, so I’ll stabilize it with more weight and a secondary jam, while directing the others to re-seat and lock the door hinge with minimal risk. I’ll avoid cutting the cord unless it’s the only way to stop the hatch creeping.*

“Kest, keep him pinned—no lifting. Free warden, mallet that thorn-nail back in *two taps at a time*, then wedge something crosswise as a keeper so it can’t creep out.”

I drop my weight lower—both knees on the hatch edge—and lean my shoulder in. “Someone slide a chisel, nail, or even a belt-buckle under the hatch lip on *my* side as a hard stop. Door-man, call it the instant that hinge starts to free.”

Knife stays hovering at the cord. “If the hatch gains a finger’s width: I will shout ‘NOW’ and only then do I cut—no one else makes that call.”

*Agent reasoning: Two threats are escalating at once; I need quick stabilization without introducing surprises. I’ll prioritize preventing the door brace from backing out and adding a hard stop under the hatch lip, while keeping strict control over any cord cut cue.*

#### Turn 139 **[GAME]**

Kest plants his knee between the boot warden’s shoulder blades and keeps him seated and pinned, dragging him another inch back by the belt without letting the boot lift. The boot stays on the stone—scraping, slow.

You drop both knees onto the hatch edge and lean your shoulder in. The hatch stops creeping for a moment—your added weight makes it **hold**, but the pressure from below doesn’t go away. It feels like something is *standing up* under it, testing you.

The free warden snatches up your wooden mallet and moves to the door brace. He gives the thorn-iron nail two controlled taps.

**TUNK. TUNK.**

The nail bites back into the jamb a fraction. The hinge plate is still visibly dished, but the walking stops—temporarily.

“Keeper—keeper—” he snaps, looking around.

Door-man yanks off his belt in a single frantic pull and shoves the **buckle** crosswise behind the nail’s head and the doorframe, jamming it like a crude stop. The free warden adds one more two-tap set to seat it against the buckle.

**TUNK. TUNK.**

Outcome at the door: the thorn-nail is driven back in and **blocked from backing out easily**. The door still shudders under outside pressure, but the hinge doesn’t immediately free.

At the hatch: the boot warden, panting, fumbles at his own waist with shaking fingers and manages to unhook his **bent clasp pin** from where it’s caught—he slides it toward you without looking, almost dropping it on the paste-slick stone.

“Use—use that—” he gasps.

You get your hard stop: he shoves the bent clasp pin under the hatch lip on your side. Metal meets stone with a sharp **click**. The hatch tries to rise again and hits the pin—**stopped**. The pin flexes under the load, but it holds for now.

Then the cord gives another deliberate pull—long and steady. The hatch presses upward into your knees and shoulder, but the pin prevents it from gaining that finger’s width. The new threat is clear and immediate: the clasp pin is **bowing**, and if it snaps or shoots out, the hatch will gain space fast.

Door-man, strained voice at the brace: “Hinge is holding—still holding—”

Kest keeps the boot warden pinned. “Eirwen,” he growls, “whatever’s down there is learning.”

#### Turn 140 **[PLAYER]**

“Then we don’t give it time.” I grit out, shifting my shoulder harder into the hatch. “Free warden—another hard stop, now: chisel, nail, anything iron. Stack it beside the clasp pin so if one shoots, the other catches.”

To Kest, low and sharp: “Once his boot is clear, get him back from the hatch—keep your knee on him but drag him away from the lip.”

I glance toward the door without lifting off the hatch. “Door-man: if that buckle slips, shout it—immediately.”

Knife edge kisses the cord—poised to cut clean. “Everyone hears me: I cut only on ‘NOW’. If the pin snaps, I’ll call it.”

*Agent reasoning: The hatch stop is failing; I need redundancy before it snaps. Cutting the cord is last resort, but I can pre-stage it and try to jam the hatch with a second wedge while keeping the door braced.*

#### Turn 141 **[GAME]**

You lean harder. The hatch edge grinds against stone and paste; your knees go numb from the pressure. The steady force beneath answers immediately—pushing up into you like a shoulder trying to rise.

The free warden scrabbles along the storage racks with one hand while keeping the other on the doorframe for balance. “Iron—iron—” He snatches a **thorn-iron warding nail** from the nearby kit (one of the spares) and darts to your side, dropping to a knee.

He tries to stack it beside the bent clasp pin under the hatch lip. There’s barely space; he angles it in.

The hatch surges upward a hair as the cord gives a short, sharp tug—just enough to **bite his fingers** between nail and stone. He yelps, but he gets the nail wedged in. Now you have **two stops**: the bent clasp pin taking the primary load, the thorn-iron nail jammed beside it as a catch.

Kest keeps his knee on the boot warden and drags him back another few inches, still careful not to lift the boot. The pinned man’s heel finally clears the ring of paste and chalk.

The moment the boot leaves the slicked circle, the pale barbs under the hatch **scrape outward** in a quick, searching fan—like a hand feeling for purchase. They hit paste, slip, and retract, frustrated.

Kest uses the opening: he hauls the boot warden back from the hatch lip in one hard pull, keeping him pinned but safely away from the edge. “Clear,” he grunts.

At the door, the belt-buckle keeper squeals under strain. Door-man presses his shoulder into the brace, eyes on the buckle. “Holding—holding—” he gasps.

Then the cord goes taut and **holds**—no jerks, no tugs. A constant, intelligent tension, as if whatever is below has decided to stop wasting strength and start measuring.

Under your knees, the bent clasp pin bows further with a faint, rising **metallic whine**. The thorn-iron nail beside it starts to creep sideways under the lip, vibrating with each micro-shift.

The threat is immediate and specific: if the clasp pin **shears** or shoots out, the hatch will gain that finger’s width in an instant—and the cord, already under steady tension, will be perfectly positioned to pull it wider before you can reset anything.

“Free warden—hammer that thorn-iron nail *deeper* as a true wedge, not just a catch; use the mallet, short taps, keep your fingers clear.”  

To Kest: “Get me a third wedge—anything metal—from his kit or the racks, and keep low.”  

I inhale, then in a hard whisper: “NOW.” I slice the cord clean in one decisive cut, keeping my shoulder and both knees locked on the hatch as I listen for the change.

*Agent reasoning: The stops are failing under sustained force; cutting the cord might release the measuring tension and buy seconds, but could also free whatever is controlling it. I need to reduce upward pressure first and prepare a replacement wedge, then cut on my own timing.*

#### Turn 143 **[GAME]**

The free warden doesn’t argue—he grips the mallet close to the head for control, knuckles white, and gives the thorn-iron nail three short, careful taps, angling it so it *bites* under the hatch lip instead of skating.

**TUNK. TUNK. TUNK.**

The nail seats deeper. You feel it in your knees: the upward pressure shifts from “about to slip” to “caught on a tooth.” The bent clasp pin is still bowed, but it stops screaming.

Kest drops low and crawls, one hand keeping his weight off the hatch line. He rips open the boot warden’s kit with a practiced jerk and comes up with a **small iron chisel**—flat, blunt, meant for scraping ward-nails out of masonry. “Got you,” he mutters, sliding it toward the free warden.

You whisper “NOW” and cut.

Your knife edge severs the cord in one clean, decisive slice.

For half a heartbeat, nothing—then the change hits like a physical release: the constant tension disappears, and the hatch tries to *settle* back into its frame under your weight.

But the thing below reacts immediately.

From the gap around the hatch edges comes a sudden, furious **scrabble**—pale barbs raking stone, searching for the cord that’s no longer there. The sound is close and fast, like nails on slate. A wet breath follows—one exhale, tasting of old incense and chimney-ash.

The severed cord end on your side snaps back and lashes against your wrist, leaving a thin red welt. The other end—below—whips away into the dark with a sharp **thup**, as if yanked.

“Cord’s cut!” the free warden barks, more to steady himself than anyone else.

Kest’s head jerks toward the hatch. “It’s still down there,” he says flatly.

At the door, the belt-buckle keeper gives a tiny slip—just a fraction—and door-man immediately shouts, voice cracking, “BUCKLE—SHIFTED!”

The door doesn’t blow, but the brace jolts and the thorn-nail in the hinge gives a brief metallic **tick** as strain redistributes. The immediate threat is now split: the hatch is momentarily more stable with the cord cut, but whatever is underneath is agitated and probing; at the same time, the door’s keeper is starting to creep under sustained outside pressure.

“Don’t look down—just work.” I keep my full weight on the hatch and press my ear to the stone for a beat, listening to where the scrabble concentrates.  

“Free warden: drive the chisel in as a third wedge beside the nail—short taps, then smear more paste over the lip and chalk it broad again.”  

To door-man: “Add a second keeper—jam a chair-leg or bar across the hinge side, low to the floor. If the buckle shifts again, call it. Kest—go help him once the wedges are set; stay out of the hatch line.”

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is temporarily stable but the thing below is probing; I should reinforce the seal while we still can. The door brace is starting to slip, so we need a secondary brace and to reduce movement/noise that could trigger another push.*

“Free warden: drive that chisel in as a third wedge beside the thorn-iron nail—short taps, fingers clear; then smear more paste over the lip and chalk it broad again.”  

“Door-man: add a second keeper—jam a chair-leg or bar across the hinge side, low to the floor. If that buckle shifts again, shout it.”  

“Kest—once the wedges are set, go help him at the door. Stay out of the hatch line.”

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is our most immediate unknown; I need to localize the movement and lock it down with redundant wedges before shifting attention to the door. I’ll also keep everyone from exposing themselves to whatever’s below.*

#### Turn 147 **[GAME]**

Your cheek presses to cold stone. With your ear against the hatch you catch the scrabble’s pattern: it isn’t random—most of it concentrates along the **far-right edge**, nearest the **iron wall-pipe** and the storage racks. A pause, then a tight, repeated *tap-tap-tap* from below, like something testing the same spot for give.

The free warden swallows hard and obeys without looking down. He takes the **small iron chisel** Kest slid over and sets its blunt end under the lip beside the thorn-iron nail. Mallet choked up again, he gives it short taps.

**TUNK. TUNK.**

On the second tap the chisel bites and holds. The hatch’s upward “want” shifts again—less lift, more *pressure*, like whatever’s beneath has switched from pulling to bracing itself under that right edge you heard.

He keeps tapping—careful, controlled—until the chisel is a true wedge. Your knees feel the difference: the hatch stops micro-shivering.

Then he smears more of the pale paste over the lip, working fast with the edge of his palm. The paste immediately darkens where it touches the stone—soaking in like thirsty chalk. He grabs chalk and drags a broad, ugly ring around the hatch seam.

The chalk line doesn’t sit still.

As he completes the circle, the line **crawls** a finger’s width toward the far-right edge—pulled, as if by a tide. The paste there puckers and dimples from below.

“That side,” you hear Kest mutter, low. “It likes that side.”

At the door, door-man hisses, “No chair in here!” He kicks at the nearest thing: a low **storage rack brace** (a narrow wooden crosspiece) and wrenches it loose with a crack. He jams it low across the hinge side, foot braced, shoulder to wood.

It helps—briefly. The brace takes some load, but the belt-buckle keeper gives another tiny **creep** and door-man barks instantly, “SHIFT—again!”

Kest waits until the wedges are set, then slides away from the hatch line and goes to the door, putting his weight into the new brace and the doorframe together.

Under you, from the far-right edge, the tapping stops.

In its place comes a slow, deliberate **press**—steady and upward—testing the wedges. The immediate threat is clear: whatever is beneath has found the strongest point to contest, and it’s now trying to **jack the hatch at the right edge** where the chalk and paste keep pulling.

“Pressure’s at the pipe-side—far right. Don’t pry that edge, just *pack* it.” I keep my weight on the hatch but shift my left hand to feel along the stone toward the wall-pipe. “Free warden—slam more paste into that right seam and wedge *toward* the pipe; use the spare nail if you’ve got one.”

I call to Kest at the door, voice tight: “If you can spare a hand—get a second belt or rope and lash that hinge brace to the frame. Door-man can’t fight creep forever.”

Without lifting off, I test the wall-pipe with two knuckles—light taps—listening for hollowness or a hidden joint. “Is that pipe fixed through the stone, or does it run into this chamber? Tell me if anyone’s seen it move.”

*Agent reasoning: The pressure focusing at the far-right edge near the wall-pipe suggests a leverage point or weakness; I should reinforce that edge without exposing anyone to the gap, and stabilize the door before it fails. I’ll get intel by probing the pipe/stonework and redirect manpower to add a safer brace.*

#### Turn 149 **[GAME]**

Your left hand creeps toward the pipe-side seam. The stone there is damp—*not* with the paste, but with a thin, cold sweat that beads under your fingertips. The hatch gives a slow, stubborn upward pulse against your weight, focused exactly where you felt the pressure.

“Packing!” the free warden says, voice tight. He scoops paste with two fingers and **forces it into the right seam**, smearing hard until his knuckles whiten. He doesn’t pry; he **stuffs**. The paste fights back—strings like taffy, then suddenly thins as if something below is drinking it.

He produces a second thorn-iron nail from his belt (shorter, slightly bent), sets it angled **toward the wall-pipe**, and gives it quick, shallow taps.

**TUNK. TUNK.**

On the second tap, something below **hits** the seam from underneath—an abrupt, focused shove. The hatch bucks a fraction of an inch; your teeth click. The new nail skitters, then catches—half-seated. The chisel wedge holds, but you feel the right edge trying to *walk*.

At the door, Kest snaps, “Hold,” and yanks off his own belt in one motion. He threads it around the wooden brace and the nearest iron ring on the doorframe—improvised, ugly. He cinches until the leather creaks. Door-man grunts, relieved, as the brace stops sliding quite so easily.

“Still creeping,” door-man calls, but slower now. “Not as fast.”

You tap the wall-pipe with two knuckles.

First tap: solid, dull—stone-backed.

Second tap, a handspan lower: a **thin, tinny ring** answers, like a hollow run.

Third tap, right at a collar joint you hadn’t noticed: the sound changes again—metal-on-metal, and your fingertip feels the faintest vibration, as if something is **moving inside** the pipe.

The free warden glances at the pipe without leaning. “Never seen it move,” he says. “But—” His eyes flick to the seam. “That side’s… listening.”

From the pipe’s collar, a whisper of grit falls—just a few grains—then a soft **click** like a valve turning a fraction on its own.

The threat clarifies: whatever is under the hatch is not only jacking the right edge—it’s **working the pipe-side**, and the pipe has a hollow section that could be a route into this chamber if it’s forced open or already compromised.

#### Turn 150 **[PLAYER]**

“Everyone—pipe joint just clicked. That’s our next mouth.”

Without shifting my weight off the hatch, I nod toward the collar with my chin. “Free warden: don’t chase the hatch seam anymore—pack paste around that collar and chalk it thick. If you’ve got wire or a strap, bind the joint tight to the stone.”

To Kest, sharp: “Can you spare a strip—shirt, belt end, anything—and loop it around the pipe collar as a tourniquet? Keep your body off the hatch line.”

I keep my ear half to the stone, half to the pipe, and tap once more lightly. “Has anyone ever seen this pipe vent or drain? Where does it run—up to the Cathedral, or into the old cistern?”

*Agent reasoning: The pipe is a likely breach point; I should confirm if it’s an access route and seal/brace it without letting up on the hatch. I’ll gather info from the wardens and redirect resources to pack and bind the pipe joint, while keeping door and hatch stabilized.*

#### Turn 151 **[GAME]**

The moment you call it a mouth, the pipe answers.

Your light tap lands on the collar. Instead of a ring, you feel a **tiny kick** back through the metal—like something inside nudged the joint from the other side. Then: **click-click**, faster, as if a latch is being worried at.

The free warden lunges to the pipe collar—careful to stay clear of the hatch line—and slaps paste around the joint in thick, ugly handfuls. He chalks over it, hard enough that chalk dust blooms. The chalk doesn’t crawl here; it **flakes**, as the pipe vibrates beneath it.

“Strap—strap—” he pants, patting himself down. No wire. No spare strap.

Kest, still bracing the door with his belt lash, tears his gaze off the creeping hinge and makes a brutal choice. He yanks his dagger, hooks it under the hem of his own shirt, and **rips a long strip** free with a sound like cloth screaming. “Catch,” he snaps, and tosses it across without stepping into your line.

The free warden loops the strip around the collar twice and cinches it tight, knotting it against the stone. The cloth bites into the paste; paste squeezes out in pale worms.

For half a breath, it holds.

Then the collar gives a **sharp quarter-turn** under the bindings—enough to twist the cloth and tighten it further—followed by a wet, pressurized **hiss**. Not steam. Not water. A thin, soot-sweet breath that smells like chimney ash and old incense.

From the seam at the collar, something **extrudes**: a black, glossy filament, like hair dipped in pitch. It tests the paste, withdraws, then pushes again—seeking a gap.

Door-man answers your question with a strained shout while he and Kest keep the brace pinned: “It’s a drain-run! Old cistern line—feeds under the Cathedral and out to the soot-alleys. We blocked it years ago—supposedly!”

The threat is now explicit: whatever is beneath the hatch is also **probing through the pipe joint**, and it has found (or is making) a way to breathe and reach into the chamber. The paste and cloth are slowing it, not stopping it.

#### Turn 152 **[PLAYER]**

“Right—cistren line means it can *carry* it. We stop the breath.”

I keep my weight pinned on the hatch and snap, “Free warden—ram paste into the seam until it bulges, then pack chalk into it like grit; use the mallet to *crimp* that collar against the stone—gentle taps, all around, make it bite.”

To Kest: “Don’t let that door creep—if you’ve got any metal left on you, buckle, clasp, anything, wedge it under the hinge brace. Door-man, if it shifts again, we fall back—tell me the nearest second exit or vent in this chamber.”

Without lifting, I draw a quick ward-mark in chalk with my free hand from the pipe collar toward the hatch seam—a binding line—and whisper, “Follow the line, not the mouth,” watching to see if the black filament recoils or tracks the chalk.

*Agent reasoning: The pipe is becoming an entry point; I need to seal or disable it without abandoning the hatch. I’ll use what we have—paste/chalk—and attempt a physical crimp/block at the collar while directing others to reinforce the door and prepare a retreat route.*

#### Turn 153 **[GAME]**

The free warden does exactly as told—too fast, but precise enough.

He rams paste into the collar seam until it **bulges** like a pale blister. Then he grinds chalk into the wet paste with his thumb, turning it into a gritty plug. The black filament tries to push through and comes out **gray-dusted**, immediately losing its shine.

It doesn’t recoil. It **hesitates**, then changes tactic—flattening into a thin, searching smear along the edge of the collar, looking for a different weakness.

He takes the mallet and begins gentle, circular taps around the collar, trying to crimp it tighter to the stone.

**tink… tink… tink…**

On the fourth tap, the collar gives a tiny deforming *give*—you hear it as a soft metallic complaint—and the hiss falters. The soot-sweet breath stutters.

Then: a sharp **crack** of old solder giving way.

The collar shifts a hair, and the pipe suddenly **pulls inward** as if something on the other side tugged it. Your chalked paste plug holds for a heartbeat… then the black filament lashes out from a new micro-gap above the plug, whipping once, fast.

It doesn’t strike flesh; it **wraps** the chalk line you drew—slick-black binding itself to white dust—then travels it like a rail, sliding toward the hatch seam.

Your ward-mark works, but not the way you wanted: the filament **tracks the line** obediently, following it straight toward the hatch’s right edge, where the pressure is already strongest.

At the door, Kest grits his teeth and shoves his **bent clasp pin** under the hinge brace as a shim. “That’s all I’ve got,” he snaps, keeping his body braced to frame and wood. The creep slows again, but doesn’t stop.

Door-man, face red with strain, jerks his chin toward the back of the chamber. “Second exit—service hatch at the end of the storage passage,” he barks. “Low. Leads into the clergy storage passage—if it’s not blocked!”

Threat, clear and immediate: the pipe is being **worked open** from the cistern side, and the black filament is now **using your chalk binding line** to reach the hatch seam—concentrating force where you’re pinned. If it reaches the seam, it can either pry under you or anchor itself to lever the hatch.

#### Turn 154 **[PLAYER]**

I grind my palm hard across my own chalk line, smearing it into useless dust, then spit and scrub again to damp it. “Free warden—wipe that line out, now; salt it with paste if you must—don’t give it a road.”

“Kest—door holds as long as it holds; door-man, send someone crawling to the service hatch and tell me if it opens or if it’s blocked—quiet, fast.” I keep my weight pinned and hiss, “If that filament touches the hatch seam, cut it—don’t grab it.”

*Agent reasoning: The chalk line became a guide; I need to break that path immediately without losing pressure on the hatch, and set up a controlled retreat via the service hatch while confirming it’s usable.*

#### Turn 155 **[GAME]**

Your palm grinds the chalk line into a smeared white bruise across the stone. Spit darkens it; your sleeve scrubs it down to wet grit. The moment the line breaks, the black filament—midway along its “road”—loses its certainty.

It pauses, quivers, then slithers in a tight, irritated loop, searching for the chalk’s clean edge. Finding only damp smear, it retreats a finger’s length back toward the pipe collar, thinning as it goes.

“Now!” you snap.

The free warden drops to a knee and wipes at the remaining chalk with his forearm, then smears a ribbon of paste over the area like mortar. He presses hard, salt-and-seal. The paste takes, but the pipe’s vibration makes little crescent cracks that he immediately thumbs shut.

At the hatch seam, you feel the pressure change: the right edge stops “walking” for a beat… then resumes with a different rhythm—less shove, more careful testing. Whatever is under there is adjusting.

Door-man, still braced, barks without looking back, “Warden—crawl!” and the second Crown warden (the one who’d been on the door earlier) peels off and drops low, belly to stone, sliding along the racks toward the storage passage.

He moves fast but quiet, keeping his profile low. As he reaches the half-open door, the gap breathes out a **cold draft** that ruffles the chalk dust on the floor.

He slips through.

Two seconds later, from down the passage: a muffled, urgent whisper—“Hatch is—”

A loud **CLACK** cuts him off, metal on metal, like a latch snapping into place by itself.

Then: silence.

Not footsteps. Not struggle. Just the absence of sound where a man should be breathing.

At the pipe collar, the soot-sweet hiss returns—thinner, more focused—like something has found a narrower straw to sip through. A new black filament begins to extrude, but this one doesn’t reach for chalk; it reaches downward, toward the stone seam at the base of the pipe, as if trying to get **under** the paste rather than across it.

The immediate threats are now twofold and clear:
1) The crawler warden has been abruptly **cut off** at the service hatch—either trapped, seized, or the hatch has sealed on its own.
2) The pipe joint is still being **actively worked**, and the “breath” is seeking a new route that may bypass your wiped line and rejoin the hatch seam from below.

“Door-man—do not leave that brace. Kest, keep the frame—listen for any second CLACK from the passage.”

“Free warden: stop the filament at the base seam—pack paste hard under the pipe foot and chalk a tight ring *around the pipe*, not toward the hatch. If it extrudes, you cut—short, clean—don’t let it wrap you.”

Without lifting off the hatch, I pitch my voice down the storage passage, measured and steady: “Warden—answer with one knock if you’re alive. Two if the hatch sealed. Three if you’re not alone.” Then I press my ear toward the stone and pipe, listening for any answering tap—or breathing—that isn’t ours.

*Agent reasoning: We’re split and blind down the passage; I need intel without sacrificing our hold on the hatch/door. The pipe is becoming a bypass route—seal its base seam and deny it purchase, while using sound/line to check the warden’s status from a distance.*

#### Turn 157 **[GAME]**

Door-man stays welded to the brace, forearms shaking. “I’m not moving,” he grunts through his teeth.

Kest shifts his stance a fraction, ear angled toward the passage while his shoulder keeps the frame pinned. “I’ll hear it,” he says, voice flat—then quieter, to you: “Or I’ll hear him stop.”

The free warden drops to the pipe’s base and does what you asked: he jams paste under the pipe foot with two fingers until his knuckles whiten, then grinds chalk into a **tight ring** around the pipe where it meets stone—no line, no road, just a collar of grit.

The black filament tries to nose into the base seam and hits the chalk ring. It doesn’t recoil; it **thins** and begins to worry at the ring’s edge like a worm trying to find a soft spot. The warden raises his knife and waits, trembling, refusing to swat at it.

You call down the storage passage, steady and clear.

Nothing answers at first.

With your ear to the stone, you catch a sound that isn’t in the room: a faint, hollow **tap** from somewhere beyond the passage door—like knuckles on metal. Then a pause. Then another tap.

**Tap. Tap.**

Two knocks.

Door-man’s eyes flick toward you, wide. Kest’s jaw tightens. “Hatch sealed,” he mutters, confirming your code without saying it louder.

Then—because the world doesn’t stop at answers—you hear a second noise through the stone: a soft, wet **exhale** that doesn’t match any of your breathing, close to the pipe’s base as if the wall itself just sighed.

The free warden freezes. The filament at the chalk ring suddenly goes slack, as if it’s no longer the only probe. A hairline crack opens in the paste under the pipe foot—tiny, but fresh—and something dark glistens in it, not filament-thin but **thicker**, like a tendril trying to wedge its way out.

Immediate threat: the pipe is no longer just “extruding” a line—something is now **forcing the base seam open**, and if it gets purchase under the pipe foot it can lever the joint wider and flood the chamber with whatever’s breathing through that cistern line.

#### Turn 158 **[PLAYER]**

“Cut it—now—before it thickens.” I keep my weight on the hatch, eyes on the crack. “Free warden: short slice, then ram paste and chalk into that gap until it’s glassy; don’t pull.”

“Kest—if you’ve got any spare metal, wedge it flat under the pipe foot like a shim; if not, rip a slat from the rack and jam it tight under there. We deny it leverage.”

Down the passage, low but firm: “Warden—stay quiet. If you can, scratch on the metal—tell us if something’s on your side.”

*Agent reasoning: The pipe base is failing and could open fully; I need to stop leverage and reduce pressure without abandoning the hatch. I’ll have them cut the tendril and add a hard brace under the pipe foot using available metal/wood, while confirming the sealed service hatch and preparing a fallback route.*

“Cut it—now—before it thickens.” I keep my weight pinned on the hatch, eyes fixed on the crack. “Free warden: short slice, then ram paste and chalk into that gap until it’s glassy—don’t pull.”

“Kest—wedge something flat under the pipe foot; metal if you’ve got it, otherwise rip a rack slat and jam it tight. Deny it leverage.”

Down the passage, low and steady: “Warden—scratch on the metal if you can. One long scratch if something’s with you. Two short if you’re alone.”

*Agent reasoning: The pipe breach is escalating and could become a full opening; we need to stop it before it gains leverage, while keeping the hatch and door stable and extracting info from the trapped warden without exposing ourselves.*

#### Turn 161 **[GAME]**

The free warden’s knife flashes once—short, decisive—right at the thickening tendril as it bulges from the hairline crack.

It cuts.

Not cleanly like rope. More like slicing fat: there’s resistance, then a slick give. The severed end snaps back into the seam with a wet recoil, and the piece that remains on your side spasms once on the stone and goes limp, oozing a dark syrup that smells faintly of burnt sugar and old pennies.

“Don’t pull,” he repeats to himself like a prayer, and immediately rams paste into the crack with his thumb, then grinds chalk into it until the gap turns pale and packed. He keeps pressing until the paste looks almost glazed—smoothed hard by insistence.

For half a breath, the pipe foot stops shifting.

Kest moves on your order without argument. He yanks a thin iron strap from his kit-belt—meant for cinching bundles, not prying—and shoves it flat under the pipe foot’s lip like a shim. It doesn’t fully fit; he hammers it in with the heel of his hand, then grabs the nearest rack slat anyway and wedges it tight beneath, making a crude brace stack: iron against stone, wood against iron.

The pipe gives a small, ugly creak—then settles. Denied leverage.

Down the passage, you get your answer—not a knock this time, but a sound that makes all three men in the room go still:

A long, slow **SCRAAAAAPE** across metal, like a nail dragged along the inside of the hatch.

One long scratch.

Then, immediately after—fainter, hurried—another shorter scrape that dies halfway, as if the hand (or whatever is making it) was interrupted.

Kest’s head snaps toward the passage. “He’s not alone,” he says, voice low.

At your knees, the hatch seam twitches—just once—like something testing whether you’re still there. The pressure under it increases, not enough to lift you, but enough that your forearms feel the vibration through the stone.

And at the pipe base, despite the packed paste, a thin bead of that dark syrup forces its way out at the edge of the “glassy” patch and begins to creep along the chalk ring—seeking a boundary, tracing it, patient.

Clear threats now:
- Something is with the trapped warden on the far side of the hatch, close enough to scrape the metal.
- The pipe breach is temporarily restrained, but the seep is still active and probing your seal, looking for the next weakness.

#### Turn 162 **[PLAYER]**

“Everyone—no chalk lines leading anywhere. Rings only, islands only.”

To the free warden: “Scrape up that syrup with a slat, don’t touch it skin-bare—lift it into a paste wad and cap it. Then lay a second ring of paste around the first, like a moat; if it crosses, we’ll see where.”

To Kest, low: “Keep the door pinned, but give me your knife—if that seam creeps again, we cut hinges before we lift a hatch.”

Down the passage, voice tight but steady: “Warden—if you can hear me, scratch a **circle** if it’s wearing your face, a **straight line** if it’s not. Don’t speak.” I press my ear to the hatch seam again, listening for anything that sounds like breath trying to match ours.

*Agent reasoning: We’re holding two failing fronts; I need intel without giving the entity a path. The syrup is testing the chalk ring—remove/redirect that boundary and isolate it. Also confirm the trapped warden’s status and buy time without opening anything.*

#### Turn 163 **[GAME]**

“Rings only,” Kest echoes, like he’s filing it away as doctrine. The door stays pinned under his shoulder; he doesn’t shift an inch.

The free warden grabs a rack slat, hooks it under the creeping bead, and scrapes. The syrup doesn’t smear like oil—it **strings**, reluctant, as if it wants to stay connected to the pipe. He keeps the slat angled up, lifts the stringy mass into a waiting wad of paste, and folds paste over it like a cap. The paste darkens where it touches, as if bruising.

He lays your “moat”: a second paste ring around the first chalk collar, thicker and uneven on purpose. He dusts chalk into the outer edge until it’s pale and readable.

The seep tries again almost immediately. A new bead appears at the glassy patch’s edge and creeps outward—hits the inner ring, hesitates, then slides along it clockwise, **testing**. It does not cross the moat yet. You can see its preference: it keeps returning to the same point near the iron shim, where metal meets stone.

Kest passes you his knife without taking his eyes off the passage door. “Don’t drop it,” he murmurs. “If we start cutting hinges, we’re committing.”

You press your ear to the hatch seam. The vibration you felt before is steadier now—like a slow rub against the underside of the metal, searching for the thinnest part.

Then the scratching comes again from beyond the hatch.

Not a circle. Not a straight line.

A **circle** starts—half-formed—then stops. A pause. Then a **straight line** is dragged hard, long enough to squeal. Then another line crosses it at an angle.

An X.

The trapped warden is either being forced, interrupted, or no longer the only one answering.

Right after the X, something on the far side makes a sound that is not a voice, but tries to use one: a wet click and a shallow inhale that **matches the rhythm** of your breathing for two beats… then gets it wrong, too long on the exhale, like it’s learning you.

The hatch seam twitches again under your weight—more insistently this time—and a faint metallic tick answers from the hinge side, as if pressure is being applied where you’d least want it.

If it pushes hard enough, it won’t need to lift the hatch; it can **shear** something—hinge, latch, or your balance—at the weakest point.

I shift my weight slightly to keep the hatch pinned but slide Kest’s knife to the free warden. “Not hinges—yet. Score the hinge-side seam shallow, just to find the thinnest point; no prying.” Then, to Kest, low: “Give me your belt or strap—anything we can cinch over the hatch like a tourniquet.”

I stop breathing for a count of three, then resume with an irregular pattern, listening hard for the thing to try to follow it. Down the passage, barely above a whisper: “Warden—if you can, scratch where it’s touching you. Don’t fight loud.”

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is being tested at the hinges and something is mimicking breath—opening it is a trap. I need to reinforce and gather info without giving it more leverage, while also preventing the pipe seep from exploiting the shim point.*

#### Turn 165 **[GAME]**

You shift—careful, controlled—keeping the hatch pinned. The pressure beneath it immediately noses toward the hinge side, like it felt the change and approved.

You slide Kest’s knife to the free warden. He nods once, jaw tight, and sets the blade shallow at the hinge-side seam. He doesn’t pry—just draws the knife along the metal edge with a light scoring pressure.

The sound is small, but the hatch answers with a sharper **tick** from below, directly under his scoring line, as if something underneath is tracking the blade’s path.

On his second pass, the knife catches at one point—barely a snag. He freezes and taps the spot with the flat of the blade. “Thinner here,” he whispers. “Or already stressed.”

Kest slips his own strap free—an oil-dark leather cinch with a thorn-iron buckle—and hands it over without looking away from the passage. “One strap,” he says. “If it goes, we lose the door too.”

You stop breathing for three.

On the far side of the hatch, the wet inhale comes—too soon, because it expected you to breathe. Then it pauses. Then it tries again, and this time it waits… and follows your resumed, irregular pattern for two breaths almost perfectly.

Whatever is there is listening to *you*, not just the room.

Down the passage, your whisper lands.

A scrape answers—messy, urgent—right up against the hatch underside near the hinge side: **short, repeated scratches**, clustered in one place like someone marking “here, here, HERE.”

Then a second sound joins it: a slow drag along the metal from the same area, heavier, as if something is being pressed or slid across the trapped warden’s side of the hatch.

The hatch shifts a hair—less than a finger-width—but it’s a real movement: a faint lift at the thinnest point the free warden found, immediately checked by your weight. The metal flexes and springs back with a dull *boing*.

At the pipe base, the syrup-bead reaches the moat again and stops—then splits, one thread continuing to test the ring, the other thread turning toward the iron shim/stone junction, as if the seep has found a second problem to worry at.

Clear, present threats:
- The thing beyond the hatch can now mimic your breathing well enough to time a push.
- The hinge-side seam has a weak point and just flexed under pressure; another coordinated shove could pop it or deform it.
- The seep is probing the metal/stone junction by the shim, potentially undermining your brace.

To the free warden: “Pack paste and chalk *over the shim/stone junction*—make it a blunt mound, no edges—and redraw the moat thicker there.” Then I go still and whisper, “No more breathing games,” pressing my mouth into my sleeve to muffle sound while I listen for the next coordinated shove and the warden’s scraping.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is about to fail at the thin hinge point and the entity can time pushes by my breathing, so I need a mechanical restraint that doesn't rely on me and reduce cues it can mimic. Meanwhile the seep is targeting the shim junction, so we must isolate/mark and reinforce that exact weak spot without creating guiding lines.*

#### Turn 167 **[GAME]**

You get the strap over the hatch and cinch it hard across the hinge side, hauling it down until the leather bites and the buckle groans. You loop it around the nearest fixed rack post and pull again. The rack shudders but holds; the strap goes taut like a tourniquet.

Kest watches the line of it, then the door, then you. “If that rack shears, it’ll whip,” he warns—quiet, not panicked.

Almost on cue, pressure swells from below at the hinge-side weak spot. The hatch flexes upward… and stops dead against the strap. Leather creaks. The rack post gives a tiny, audible *tick* as it takes load. The hatch doesn’t lift, but the force redirects: the metal **grinds** sideways a fraction, trying to walk out from under the strap rather than up through it.

“Strap’s holding,” Kest says, voice clipped.

The free warden drops to the pipe base and does exactly what you said: he packs paste over the shim/stone junction, building a blunt mound with no corners, then dusts it thick with chalk until it’s pale and matte. He redraws the moat wider at that point, making a fat chalked berm.

The syrup reacts like it’s offended. A thin thread that had been worrying the junction hits the new mound and doesn’t cross—yet—but it **climbs** the paste a hair’s breadth, leaving a dark stain that spreads slowly through the chalk like ink in wet paper.

Then, from under the hatch, the scraping starts again—fast, desperate. Not random this time: a cluster right beneath the hinge-side weak point, exactly where the strap is biting down.

And over it, another sound: a slow, careful rub of something hard against the underside of the hatch, as if aligning a tool—or a tooth—against the stressed seam.

The next shove comes coordinated with that rub. The hatch bucks once, sharply. The strap holds, but the rack post bends just enough to make the strap **slip a finger-width** along the hatch edge. Not free—just displaced.

Kest’s head snaps to the strap. “It moved,” he says immediately, as promised. He shifts his stance to brace the rack with his shoulder while keeping the door pinned with his hip—an awkward split, but he manages it.

The threat is clear and immediate: whatever is below has figured out the weak point and is now trying to **walk the hatch out from under the strap** by grinding it sideways, not lifting it. If it gains another inch, the strap won’t be over the hinge-side stress point anymore—and the next shove could pop the seam.

#### Turn 168 **[PLAYER]**

“Kest—keep bracing, but don’t let that strap ride. Free warden: slap paste *on top of the hatch edge* right where the strap crosses—make a tacky ridge, then chalk it; we need friction, not force.”

I grab a second length—anything loose on the rack—and lash a backup line from the strap to a second post (or the door frame if it’s fixed), creating a V so it can’t drift sideways. “Warden—three rapid scratches if it’s starting to cut through the hinge. Otherwise, stay still.”

*Agent reasoning: It’s trying to slide the hatch out from under the strap; I need an anti-slip “stop” and to relieve lateral movement without opening anything. Also the rack post is a weak anchor—better to add a second anchor and wedge the strap in place with paste/chalk to increase friction.*

#### Turn 169 **[GAME]**

Kest grunts and plants his shoulder harder into the rack post, using his forearm to pin the strap’s buckle in place. “I feel it trying to walk,” he says. “Keep it centered.”

The free warden smears a tacky ridge of paste along the hatch edge right under the strap’s path—thick enough to bead up, not so thick it slumps. He dusts it with chalk until it turns from glossy to gritty. When he presses the strap down into it, it sticks with a soft *thup*, like leather meeting sap.

The immediate effect is real: the next sideways grind from below makes the hatch **shiver** but doesn’t carry the strap with it. Instead, the strap bites into the chalked paste ridge and holds its lane.

You grab the only loose length at hand—Kest’s spare thin cord from your kit—and lash a backup line from the strap to a second rack upright, making a V that pulls the strap back toward center. The rack groans again under the new angle, but it doesn’t shift; the V-line keeps the strap from drifting.

Under the hatch, the hard rub becomes more insistent—then changes pitch, like whatever’s down there has met resistance and is now testing a different contact point. A new grinding starts nearer the latch side, probing for another weakness.

Then—three rapid scratches.

They’re tight and panicked, directly beneath the hinge-side weak point.

The trapped warden isn’t just warning you; he’s marking the exact spot where something is actively working the hinge hardware. Immediately after the scratches, a metallic *tink… tink* follows—small impacts, like something tapping or pecking at a pin.

Kest goes very still. “That’s not hands,” he murmurs. “That’s a tool. Or teeth.”

At the pipe base, the syrup stain in the chalked mound spreads another thumbprint outward, darkening the paste. It still hasn’t crossed the moat, but it’s **eating adhesion**—slowly—where your brace and the rack’s foot meet the damp stone.

What’s happening now, concretely:
- Your friction ridge + V-line **stops the strap from sliding** with the hatch’s sideways grinding.
- Something below has begun **actively attacking the hinge/pin area** (scratches + tapping).
- The seep is **weakening the paste** at the shim/stone junction over time; your brace isn’t failing yet, but it’s being undermined.

#### Turn 170 **[PLAYER]**

“Kest, keep that rack braced—don’t chase the sounds; just hold pressure.”  

To the free warden: “More paste—right over the hinge-side seam where it’s thinnest. Smear it *across* the seam like a cap, chalk it heavy; we’re trying to gum whatever’s pecking that pin.”  

I press my palm flat to the hatch above the hinge point and whisper down, “Warden—are you pinned to the hinge side? One scratch yes, two no.” Then I glance to the pipe brace. “After the seam’s capped, reinforce the mound with a dry wedge—wood only—so if the syrup eats the paste, the brace still has bite.”

*Agent reasoning: The hinge is being attacked; keeping the hatch pinned is priority. I need to slow hinge-pin failure without opening the hatch, and stabilize the brace before the seep eats it loose. I’ll add redundancy at the hinge and gather info from the warden with minimal noise.*

#### Turn 171 **[GAME]**

Kest doesn’t move from his brace. He sets his boots wider, shoulder locked to the rack post, forearm clamped over the strap line so it can’t hop. “Holding,” he says. “If it shifts, it shifts against me first.”

The free warden scoops more paste and smears it directly over the hinge-side seam—right where he’d found the thin, stressed point—dragging it *across* the seam like a cap. He presses it down hard with the heel of his hand, then powders it with chalk until it’s a pale, gritty band bridging metal-to-metal.

From below, the tapping hits again—*tink tink tink*—then abruptly turns into a muffled, ugly *thud* as the paste absorbs the impact. A second later: a wet, irritated scraping, like something trying to wipe its own face.

Your palm on the hatch feels the vibration shift: the attacks are no longer clean pin-point taps; they’re smearing, sliding motions, as if whatever was pecking is now stuck or clogged and trying to regain purchase.

You whisper your question down.

One scratch answers.

The trapped warden is pinned toward the hinge side.

That makes the next sound worse: something drags along the underside near that same hinge line—heavy enough that the hatch trembles under your hand—followed by a short, breathy wheeze that doesn’t match any human rhythm. It’s close to him. Close enough to press weight where he’s trapped.

At the pipe brace, the free warden breaks off a dry wooden shim from a crate slat (splintery, pale) and hammers it into the mound’s outer edge with the mallet—wood-on-stone, controlled taps—so the brace has a hard bite even if the paste softens. The wedge seats with a satisfying *knock* and stops moving.

Immediate consequences:
- The seam-cap **gums the hinge-side attack**: the pin-pecking becomes smeared, less effective.
- The trapped warden confirms he’s **pinned on the hinge side**, directly under the active pressure point.
- The seep continues to stain and soften the paste, but the **wood wedge now carries load**; the brace is less dependent on adhesion.

Then the thing below changes tactics.

Instead of pushing up, it pulls—there’s a sudden downward yank sensation through the hatch, like suction or a hooked grip catching the seam-cap and trying to peel it away. The paste stretches and makes a thin tearing sound.

Kest tightens his brace. “It’s trying to *strip* the cap,” he says through his teeth. “Next it’ll go back to the pin.”

#### Turn 172 **[PLAYER]**

“Don’t let it peel clean—free warden, slap a *second* layer of paste over the cap and feather it wide, then chalk it; make it one big ugly blister it can’t get a lip under.”  

I press down hard with both hands over the hinge-side seam to counter the yank, then hiss to Kest, “If the rack starts to give, tell me before it goes—no heroics.”  

Down to the trapped warden, sharp whisper: “Mark—one scratch if you can move your arm. Two if you can’t. Stay quiet.”

*Agent reasoning: The cap is being peeled; if it comes off, the hinge attack resumes and the pinned warden is at risk. I should reinforce the cap and deny purchase, while avoiding opening the hatch. Also need quick info from the trapped warden and keep anchors stable.*

#### Turn 173 **[GAME]**

The free warden obeys fast—he slaps a second layer of paste over the seam-cap, then smears it outward in a wide feather, turning the hinge-side edge into a fat, uneven blister that extends onto the hatch by a palm’s breadth. He chalks it until it’s dry-gritty on top, not slick.

You throw both hands down over the hinge-side seam and lean your weight in. The next yank from below hits—hard—but instead of catching a clean edge, it drags across the blister and skids. The paste stretches, holds, then rebounds with a wet *snap* that leaves a shallow gouge but no peel.

Kest answers without looking away from his brace: “Rack’s holding. If it starts to go, I’ll say it. No heroics.” His voice is tight, but steady.

You whisper to the trapped warden.

For a beat there’s nothing—then: two scratches, faint and close.

He can’t move his arm.

Immediately after those scratches, something below exhales again—too close to be echo. The hatch trembles in short, uneven pulses, like weight shifting right under the hinge side where he’s pinned. The thing stops yanking and starts **pressing upward in small, testing lifts**, trying to find any place the blister is thinner.

The strap and your V-line hold center. The rack complains with a low wood groan, but it doesn’t slip.

At the pipe brace, the syrup stain reaches the edge of the chalked mound and dulls it, turning the chalk from powdery white to gray paste in a slow creep. The wooden wedge still bites, but the softened paste around it allows a **millimeter of settling**—enough that the pipe’s angle changes just slightly.

The free warden notices and says, “Brace settled—just a hair.”

The threat is now split and immediate:
- Below: the attacker has stopped peeling and is **probing for a thin point** to resume pin/hinge work—right where the trapped warden is pinned and unable to move his arm.
- Above: the **pipe brace is beginning to sink** as the seep eats the mound; the wedge is carrying load, but if the base continues to soften, the pipe could shift again.

#### Turn 174 **[PLAYER]**

“Keep probing, keep failing,” I whisper down at the hatch, and press my weight harder over the hinge-side blister, palms flat to feel any thinning.

To Kest, low: “You stay married to that rack and strap. If it creaks wrong, you warn me—early.”

To the free warden: “Don’t feed the seep more paste. Get dry wood—planks, wedges—build a crib under the pipe and the rack foot if you can, something it can’t melt through. Then redraw the moat *farther out* around the whole base, wider, so it has to travel.”

Down to the trapped warden: “Stay still. If the pressure shifts off the hinge side even a finger, give me one long scratch.”

*Agent reasoning: Two fronts are failing: the hatch needs continued pressure and the brace is starting to sink. I shouldn’t abandon the hatch, but the brace must be stabilized with something the seep can’t dissolve—mechanical support and dry material. I’ll delegate: keep Kest and my weight on the hinge point while the free warden shores the brace with wood/metal and re-cut the moat farther out to buy time.*

#### Turn 175 **[GAME]**

You put your weight into the hatch until your wrists ache. Through the paste-blister you can feel the tiny “lifts” from below: *test—fail—test—fail*, the pressure sliding along the hinge line looking for a thin lip that isn’t there.

Kest stays locked in. He doesn’t chase the sound; he watches the rack’s joints and the strap’s tension like a man watching a bowstring. “Still good,” he mutters. “But the rack’s starting to talk.”

The free warden stops reaching for paste. He yanks a loose plank from a crate lid and snaps it down into shorter lengths with the chisel and mallet—quick, ugly carpentry. He shoves the first piece under the pipe’s low point, then hammers a second wedge against it to make a crude crib. The pipe’s angle steadies; the earlier millimeter of settling stops.

He scoots to the rack foot and starts building a second crib under the nearest leg—wood against stone—forcing the load onto dry timber instead of the softening paste.

Then he redraws the chalk moat wider—farther out around the entire base—making a bigger ring that the syrup would have to cross before it can reach the cribbing. The chalk line goes down clean and bright, but where it passes near the existing gray stain it immediately dulls at the edge, as if the seep is already misting outward.

Under your hands, the probing pressure suddenly *halts*.

A new sound replaces it: a slow, deliberate scrape along the underside of the hatch, moving away from the hinge side—like something dragging itself laterally to find another purchase point.

You whisper your instruction to the trapped warden.

For two long breaths: nothing.

Then: one long scratch—drawn out, ragged.

The pressure has shifted off the hinge side, at least slightly.

But the relief is brief. A sharp *clack* sounds from the latch side—metal on metal—followed by a series of quick, precise taps. Not random battering: **someone or something is now working the latch hardware**, trying to defeat it instead of the hinge.

Kest’s head snaps a fraction toward the latch end, but his body stays braced. “It’s switching ends,” he says. “If that latch goes, your blister won’t matter.”

The free warden freezes mid-hammer. “We don’t have a second strap long enough,” he says, eyes on the latch side. “Not unless we sacrifice the rack brace.”

Nothing has opened yet. The immediate threat is clear and present: the attacker below is actively attempting to **pick/knock the latch free** while you’re weighted over the hinge-side blister, and your current restraint system is centered on preventing hinge-side peel—not a latch release.

#### Turn 176 **[PLAYER]**

I slide my weight off the hinge just enough to reach the latch side, keeping one forearm pressed to the hatch. “Free warden—jam the latch: dry wood wedge into the latch seam from above, then smear paste over the latch plate and key gap, chalk it heavy. Make it ugly—no edges to catch.”

To Kest, low: “Hold the rack. If it starts to fail, say it *now*, not after.”

I press my ear close to the hatch near the latch and whisper down, “Warden—what’s hitting the latch? One scratch if it sounds like metal tool, two if it’s bone/teeth.”

*Agent reasoning: The attacker is now targeting the latch; we need a quick, low-risk way to block or jam it without removing the existing brace. We have wood, paste, chalk, and a pipe/rack structure—so I’ll create a physical latch-jam and add friction/adhesion to stop it being worked, while keeping Kest on the rack. I’ll also ask the trapped warden for any info on what’s manipulating the latch.*

#### Turn 177 **[GAME]**

You shift—careful, controlled—keeping your forearm planted so the hatch can’t “breathe” up while you slide your weight toward the latch side.

The instant you do, the hinge-side probing returns—one hard lift that makes the paste-blister flex under your forearm. It doesn’t peel, but it **bulges**; you feel how close the trapped warden’s world is on the other side of that metal.

At the latch, the tapping becomes crisp and purposeful: *tap—tap—tap—CLACK*, like something striking the same point to walk a mechanism.

The free warden is already moving. He shoves a dry wedge of crate-wood into the latch seam from above and hammers it in with two sharp mallet strikes. The hatch gives a tiny, unwilling *tick* as the wedge bites; the latch-side tapping below immediately changes pitch, as if it’s now hitting wood instead of metal.

Then he smears paste over the latch plate and into the key gap—packing it, not just coating it—until the whole latch area becomes a thick, irregular scab. He chalks it heavy, turning it into a pale, gritty lump with no clean edges.

Below, something scrapes at the new mess. It tries to hook under the wedge and fails; you hear a frustrated *skritch* that sounds like hard material dragging over grit.

Kest answers you without hesitation: “Holding. If it starts to go, you’ll hear me first.” He tightens the strap a fraction; the rack groans, but the cribbing under the leg keeps it from settling further.

You press your ear to the hatch near the latch and whisper your question down.

A pause—then **one scratch** from the trapped warden.

Metal tool.

Almost immediately after that confirmation, a different sound joins the work below: a thin, rhythmic *ting… ting… ting…* traveling along the underside near the latch plate—like a small metal point being used to **test** for an unsealed seam or to find the edge of the paste plug in the key gap.

The jam is working—for now—but the attacker has switched from brute tapping to patient probing with a tool, and you’ve felt how quickly the hinge-side pressure returns when your weight shifts away.

#### Turn 178 **[PLAYER]**

“Kest—keep your shoulder on it and watch the hinge end; call the instant you feel a ‘pop’ or a new rhythm.”  

To the free warden, quick and quiet: “Do we have wire, nails, or a thin strip of metal? Anything to pin that wedge in place so it can’t be teased out.”  

I press my palm back onto the hinge-side blister to stop the bulge, then whisper down at the latch: “Warden—listen. Is that tool *scraping around the key gap* or *under the latch plate*? One scratch key gap, two scratches under-plate.”

*Agent reasoning: The attacker has a metal tool and is now probing for seams; pure brute-force resistance may fail. I should gather intel on what’s below and add a countermeasure that targets the tool’s access—without compromising the brace. I’ll also coordinate roles so hinge and latch are both watched.*

#### Turn 179 **[GAME]**

Kest shifts his shoulder harder into the rack upright, cheek almost against the wood so he can feel vibration through it. “I’m listening,” he says. “If it changes, you’ll know.”

The free warden flicks his gaze over the storage passage and the scattered gear. “Nails—yes. Thin metal—no. Wire—no.” He snatches one of the thorn-iron warding nails from the floor by the racks—**not yours**, one of the Crown’s spare warding nails—and sets its point at an angle into the crate-wood wedge that’s jammed into the latch seam. With the mallet he gives it two controlled taps, pinning the wedge to the hatch’s upper lip like a crude rivet.

The nail bites. The wedge can’t back out cleanly now without shearing wood.

Below, the probing immediately changes: the *ting…ting* becomes a harsher *tink—tink—tink* as the tool strikes the nail head through the hatch metal, testing it, then sliding off to hunt for a softer edge.

You press your palm back onto the hinge-side blister. The bulge stops; the hinge-side pressure is still there, but it’s being denied leverage.

You whisper your question down.

A moment later: **one scratch**.

Key gap.

As if answering, the metal point below returns to the key area with a slow, careful circle—*skritch… skritch…*—trying to carve a channel through paste and chalk. The paste plug holds, but you can hear it being worried at, grain by grain.

Kest suddenly murmurs, “New rhythm—hinge side.” Not a pop yet, but a pattern: three quick lifts, a pause, three quick lifts again—like whoever’s down there is coordinating pressure at the hinge while the tool works the key gap.

The hatch doesn’t open. But the threat has sharpened: **a metal tool is actively excavating the key gap while timed hinge lifts try to flex the hatch and crack the paste**, and they’ve started coordinating both ends instead of focusing on one.

“Free warden—build me a crossbar: plank across the hatch, spanning stone to stone, and wedge it tight so the latch can’t lift even if the key clears. Use crib wood; I want wood-on-stone compression, not paste.”

I keep my palm on the hinge blister but start varying my pressure—hard down on their three-lift rhythm, then easing slightly during the pause to spoil their timing. “Kest, count it out for me—call the pause.”

Down to the trapped warden, barely a breath: “Mark—can you reach the underside of the keyhole at all? One scratch yes, two no. If yes, I’ll talk you through fouling the tool.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re coordinating hinge flex with key-gap excavation; I need to deny flex and make the key gap impossible to clear without giving them something to leverage. I’ll add a second mechanical restraint on the latch side and disrupt their timing by varying pressure, while asking what materials we still have for a proper crossbar.*

#### Turn 181 **[GAME]**

The free warden moves fast—too fast to be graceful. He yanks two crate planks free, lays the longer one across the hatch so it spans from stone lip to stone lip, then shims both ends with the dry crib-wedges he’d been using under the pipe. He hammers the wedges down until the plank bows slightly and locks in compression against the masonry.

The hatch answers with a dull, constrained *thunk* as the bar takes load. The latch-side tool below immediately hits something it can’t “give” anymore—its *skritch* turns into a frustrated, higher scrape. The latch can’t rise without lifting the whole crossbar, and the crossbar is pinned by stone.

Consequence: the pipe-cribbing is now partially cannibalized. The iron wall-pipe sags a hair and then settles—still supported, but less confidently. A thin thread of paste-syrup resumes from the cracked edge of the earlier seal and begins creeping toward the nearest wedge on the floor. Not fast, but it’s moving.

You start spoiling their timing at the hinge blister—pressing hard on the three-lift rhythm, easing during the pause.

It works for about two cycles. The pressure below “misses” once—one lift arrives into your hard press and goes nowhere, another arrives into your eased moment and gets only a shallow flex.

Then whoever’s down there adapts. The rhythm changes: no longer three-and-pause. It becomes irregular—two quick, one long, then a half-beat stutter—trying to catch you off-pattern. The hinge-side blister gives a wet little *creep* under your palm: not a peel, but the paste is being slowly extruded sideways by repeated flexing.

Kest counts under his breath, close to your ear. “Two—two—long—” then, sharper, “Pause—now.” He’s right often enough to help, but the pattern keeps shifting.

You whisper to Mark beneath the hatch.

A beat.

**One scratch.**

Yes—he can reach the underside of the keyhole.

Immediately after his scratch, you hear a faint, close sound from the key-gap area: Mark shifting position below, metal or bone brushing the underside of the hatch as he tries to get his hand or tool into place.

Above, the free warden glances at the creeping syrup line and says quietly, “Crossbar’s in. But I’ve robbed the pipe. If that paste reaches the wedges, it’ll start eating our feet out from under us.”

The immediate threats are now split and concrete:
1) Below: coordinated pressure + a metal probe still worrying the key gap, now partially blocked by your crossbar but still attempting to clear it.
2) Above: the paste-syrup has resumed creeping and is on course to undermine the remaining cribbing and wedges if it reaches them.

“Free warden—cut a dry diversion: scratch a new chalk moat between that syrup thread and our wedges, then lay a sacrificial plank bridge *outside* the moat to lure it away. No paste near our supports.”

I keep my palm hard on the hinge blister, then whisper down through the key area, “Mark—use anything you can reach: grit, chalk dust, splinters. Pack the underside of the keyhole tight and smear it upward so the probe jams. If you can catch the tool tip, bend it or snap it—slow, don’t expose your fingers.”

To Kest, tight: “Keep counting, but if you feel that hinge-side ‘creep’ turn into a slip, shout—don’t whisper.”

*Agent reasoning: We need to stop the seep from reaching our wedges and also exploit Mark’s reach to foul the keyhole probe. I’ll delegate containment to the free warden while I coach Mark, keeping pressure on the hinge to prevent a peel during the coordination attempt.*

#### Turn 183 **[GAME]**

The free warden drops to a knee and grinds chalk into the stone in a hard, fast arc—an ugly white trench between the syrup-thread and the nearest support wedges. He deepens it with the edge of a plank until it’s a shallow gutter rather than a line. Then he drags a sacrificial plank to the far side of the moat and props it at a slight incline, making a new “easy path” that leads away from your cribbing.

The syrup reaches the moat, hesitates, then begins to creep along the chalk groove instead of straight forward—pulled by the fresh abrasion and the easier slope. It doesn’t stop, but it’s redirected; it starts sliding toward the sacrificial plank rather than your supports.

Consequence: the chalk moat is buying time, not safety. The syrup is thin enough that it can eventually sheet across dust if it pools.

You keep your palm hard on the hinge blister.

Below, Mark moves. You hear a faint rasp right under the key gap—then a soft, gritty patter as he shakes dust or grit into place. The keyhole sound changes: the probe’s *skritch* becomes a duller *scrape*, like it’s pushing into packed grit instead of cutting paste cleanly.

Then: *tink—tink—tink*—the probe tip testing, trying to find purchase.

Mark tries to smear the packed material upward. The underside contact becomes a slow *shhhk… shhhk…* as he presses and drags.

For a few seconds, the probe stalls.

Then the attacker changes approach: a sharper, more forceful jab—*TINK*—followed by a short sawing motion. The grit plug holds, but you hear it being ground down. Mark’s breathing below the hatch gets louder for a moment, controlled but strained, as he keeps his fingers back.

Kest keeps counting, voice low but steady—until the hinge-side pressure does something new.

Instead of lifting, it **rolls**—a levering twist along the hinge line. Under your palm the blister doesn’t just creep; it **shears** sideways a fraction with a wet, sticky *slip*. Not open, but a real loss of seal.

Kest barks, loud: “SLIP—HINGE!”

At the same time, a hairline gap opens at the hinge edge—thin as a needle—enough for cold air and a faint, sour-breath draft to kiss your wrist. Something below has gained a new angle. The next twist could widen it, and your palm is now the only thing keeping that gap from becoming leverage.

#### Turn 184 **[PLAYER]**

I slam my forearm and shoulder down over the hinge edge, shifting my weight to cover the hairline gap completely. “Free warden—second crossbar, now: lay a plank lengthwise along the hinge line and wedge it into the stone so it can’t roll. No paste—wood-on-stone!”

To Kest, sharp: “Keep the rack—if you can spare a strap, run it over my back and under that hinge-bar once it’s in. I don’t care if it bruises.”

Down to Mark, urgent but low: “They’ve got a gap at the hinge. Keep packing the keyhole, but don’t risk your fingers—if you can, drag grit toward the hinge side under the seam and foul their leverage point.”

*Agent reasoning: The hinge seal is failing; I need to prevent the gap from widening immediately while adding a mechanical brace that doesn’t rely on paste. I also need to keep the latch crossbar and stop the tool, but the hinge is the imminent breach point.*

I drive my shoulder and forearm hard over the hinge edge, putting my full weight onto the hairline gap to smother it. “Second bar—along the hinge, wedged stone-to-stone, now. No paste; I want it unable to roll.”  

“Kest—hold the rack; if you’ve got a spare strap, loop it over my back and under that hinge-bar once it’s seated. Tight enough to hurt.”  

Down to Mark, a breath: “They’ve got hinge purchase. Keep the keyhole packed, but don’t offer fingers—if you can, drag grit under the hinge seam to foul whatever they’re levering with.”

*Agent reasoning: The hinge seal has started to shear; my priority is to deny leverage immediately and add a mechanical restraint that doesn’t rely on paste. I also need Kest and the free warden coordinated, and Mark warned to avoid losing fingers while still fouling the attacker’s toolwork.*

I throw my full weight onto the hinge edge—forearm, shoulder, ribs—smothering the hairline gap. “Free warden—second crossbar, lengthwise along the hinge; wedge it stone-to-stone so it can’t roll. No paste—wood on stone!”

“Kest—keep the rack. If you’ve got a spare strap, loop it over my back and under that hinge-bar the instant it’s seated; pull it tight enough to bruise.”

Down to Mark, barely a breath: “They’ve got hinge purchase. Keep the keyhole packed, but don’t risk fingers—if you can, drag grit under the hinge seam and foul whatever they’re levering with.”

*Agent reasoning: The hinge gap is the immediate failure point; I need to physically deny it while ordering a redundant, mechanical restraint that doesn’t rely on paste. I also want Kest ready to cinch me in place and Mark to foul leverage from below without risking his hands.*

#### Turn 190 **[PLAYER]**

I keep my full weight pinned on the hinge seam, listening for the next twist. “Free warden—report: can you get that hinge-length plank seated and wedged without stepping in the syrup line?”  

“Kest, loud counts—call every change. Mark, one scratch if you can get grit under the hinge seam, two if you can’t—don’t gamble your fingers.”

*Agent reasoning: The hinge is starting to shear; I need immediate mechanical counter-leverage and to keep everyone coordinated while watching for the paste undermining the supports.*

#### Turn 191 **[GAME]**

Your weight seals the hinge seam for a heartbeat—then the door gives a tiny, ugly shudder as something on the other side finds new purchase. Not wider. Just *different*: a scraping pressure that travels up the hinge line like a tool being walked into position.

The free Crown warden—boots planted on the *clean* flagstones just short of the glossy syrup smear—leans in, jaw clenched. He’s got the second crossbar (a rough plank scavenged from the storage rack) held lengthwise, but he can’t bring it flush without crossing the syrup line.

“I can seat it,” he says, breathless, “but I’ve got to reach over the slick. If I step in that, I’m down and I’ll take you with me.”

He shifts tactics: hooks the plank’s far end with the iron wall-hook’s looped chain, using the chain like a crude third hand. He drags the plank into alignment along the hinge edge, inch by inch, *without* stepping into the syrup—arms shaking from the leverage.

Kest’s voice cuts in, loud and steady over the growing scrape. “COUNT ONE—pressure rising. COUNT TWO—stop. They’re changing angle. COUNT THREE—there—hear that? That’s metal kissing pin.”

On “three,” the hinge seam under your forearm *ticks*—a thin metallic click that isn’t wood settling. Something has contacted the hinge pin itself.

From below the keyhole: a faint, frantic sound of nail on stone—*one* scratch, then a pause, then *another single scratch* as if he’s confirming it. Grit rasps under the hinge line, and the scraping from the other side stutters for half a second—tool meeting sand.

The warden gets the plank seated at last—wood pressed tight to stone along the hinge-side—but it isn’t wedged yet. It’s in position, held by chain tension and his white-knuckled grip.

Then the door shudders again, harder. The hinge line tries to *lift* against you, as if they’re attempting to pop the pin upward rather than pry the door open.

Kest snaps, “They’re going for the pins. If that pin walks, your weight won’t matter.”

#### Turn 192 **[PLAYER]**

“Kest—keep counting, but watch the *top* of the hinge: if that pin rises even a hair, shout ‘PIN’.”

I grind my heel grit and splinters into the hinge seam above my forearm, trying to pack a crude ‘cap’ where the pin would lift. “Mark—if you can reach any nail, wire, or hard sliver, jam it *up* into the hinge-pin channel from below. Anything to stop it walking.”

To the free warden, through clenched teeth: “Wedge it now—drive shims at both ends of that hinge-plank, fast. If you’ve got a strap or chain, cinch it around the plank and the nearest stone anchor; I want the hinge line clamped, not just covered.”

*Agent reasoning: If they pull the hinge pin, brute weight won’t hold; we need to block the pin from rising and get that hinge-length plank wedged fast without anyone stepping in the syrup. Use available grit/splinters as a “pin cap,” and lash the plank in place to stop roll/lift.*

#### Turn 193 **[GAME]**

Kest shifts his stance so he can see the hinge topside and the crack by your shoulder. “COUNT ONE—steady. COUNT TWO—pressure climbing. COUNT THREE—”

You grind your heel hard into the seam above your forearm. Grit, splinters, and a curl of old mortar dust pack into the hairline. It doesn’t *seal* it, but it makes a rough, biting plug.

Below, Mark doesn’t answer with words—just stone-scrape and breath. Something thin and hard rasps upward inside the hinge channel: not a nail (too blunt), more like a snapped sliver of thorn-iron nail or a shard of chisel-bit. He wedges it up with a trembling persistence.

The free warden moves fast. He drops to one knee on the clean stone, reaches into the rack debris, and finds two crude shims—broken wedge-like slats. He drives one at the top end of the hinge-plank with the heel of his palm, then the other at the bottom with a quick, brutal punch. The plank bites tighter into place with a dull *thunk-thunk*.

He grabs the looped chain from the wall-hook and wraps it around the plank and the nearest rack upright, then hauls it taut. The chain links squeal against wood; he braces and pulls until his knuckles go white. It’s not elegant, but it clamps the plank hard enough that the hinge edge can’t flex outward easily.

On the other side, the force changes immediately: the lifting attempt becomes a furious, upward *ratcheting* at the hinge pin.

Kest barks, “COUNT FOUR—PIN—PIN!” at the exact moment the top of the hinge pin rises a finger’s breadth—then stops dead with a sharp *ting* as Mark’s jam catches it.

The door bucks once, heavy and frustrated, sending a shock through your ribs and shoulder. The pin doesn’t rise further—but the jammed metal inside the hinge channel grinds, and you hear Mark hiss in pain as whatever he’s using bites into his hand.

Then a new sound: a thin, wet *snick* at the keyhole area, like something flexible being slipped in where the packed cloth is—testing, probing for a gap.

The hinge is held for now. The threat has shifted: they’re no longer winning with leverage, and are trying to defeat the keyhole pack with something narrow and slick.

#### Turn 194 **[PLAYER]**

“Kest—keep eyes on that pin; if it moves again, shout. Warden—hold that chain clamp; don’t let it slack.”

Without lifting off the hinge seam, I call down, “Mark—pull your hand back. Are you bleeding? One word: ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ Don’t die down there.”

I spit onto my palm, scoop a pinch of grit and splinters, and flick it toward the keyhole seam. “Pack the keyhole with *abrasive*—grit, dust, anything. If that slick thing’s a wire or eel-skin, make it bite and snag. No fingers—use cloth on a stick or the edge of the bar.”

*Agent reasoning: The hinge is temporarily secured; the new vulnerability is the keyhole being probed with something slick. I should stop the probe without exposing fingers, reinforce the pack, and check Mark’s injury so he doesn’t lose his grip. Also gather intel: what tool is it, how many attackers, and buy time.*

#### Turn 195 **[GAME]**

Kest plants himself where he can see the hinge top and the door edge at once. “COUNT FIVE—steady. COUNT SIX—no rise. I’m watching.”

The free warden keeps the chain cinched, one boot braced against the rack upright so it can’t creep. His arms tremble from holding tension. “Holding. If it slips, I’ll yell.”

Down at the keyhole level, Mark sucks in a breath and answers, hoarse: “Yes.” Then, after a beat, “Not… pouring.” You hear him scuff backward—him dragging his body away from the hinge channel like you ordered.

Your spit-wet grit flicks into the keyhole seam and the tiny gaps around the packed cloth. It turns the edge into a gritty paste. On the other side, the slick probe (wire or something coated) slides in another fraction—then *catches*. You hear a faint, irritated tugging, and the probe withdraws with a dry, sandpapery scrape.

The wardens take your cue. The free one tears a strip off the dry linen cloth (already in the room) and wraps it around the end of the iron chisel like a crude swab. He dips the cloth into dust and rack-splinters, then rams the cloth-wrapped tip toward the keyhole pack without putting fingers near it.

The result is immediate: the keyhole area makes a muffled *crunch* as grit compacts into the cloth and jambs the narrow opening. The slick probe tries again—pushes, flexes—then snags hard enough that it makes a sharp *twang* when it’s yanked back.

A new threat replaces it: a thin trickle of syrup begins to seep from the keyhole itself, dark and glossy, as if they’ve started feeding something through to dissolve or lubricate the jam. It threads down the door face toward the existing syrup line on the floor, thickening the hazard.

Kest’s voice tightens. “They’re changing tools. Pin’s still seated—keyhole’s bleeding syrup now.”

Mark coughs once from below. “I can… taste it. Don’t let it reach me.”

#### Turn 196 **[PLAYER]**

“Mark—move back another arm’s length, now; keep your face turned away from the door. Warden, tear more cloth—make a trough, not a plug.”

Without lifting off the hinge seam, I nod toward the door’s lower edge. “Kest—give me a clear count if pressure changes, but also watch the syrup line: if it reaches the hinge-plank or Mark, shout.”

To the free warden: “Pack stays—don’t pull it. Lay folded cloth under the keyhole to *catch* the syrup and lead it sideways away from the hinge and away from Mark; if we’ve got dust or ash, heap it on the floor to thicken it into sludge.”

*Agent reasoning: Syrup may be corrosive/enchanted lubricant; letting it pool risks slips and could dissolve our jam. Need to divert/contain flow and keep Mark safe while maintaining hinge pressure. Minimal movement to avoid losing seal.*

#### Turn 197 **[GAME]**

Mark drags himself back with a wet scrape of coat on stone—one full arm’s length, then another half as if fear lends him extra distance. He turns his face away like you ordered, voice muffled against his sleeve. “Back. Back.”

The free warden doesn’t touch the keyhole pack. He tears more of the dry linen into long strips, folds them into a shallow V, and shoves the “trough” under the keyhole drip so the syrup hits cloth instead of stone. The cloth darkens immediately, stiffening as it drinks. He angles the far end of the trough sideways—away from the hinge-plank and away from where Mark was. “It’s wicking. Slow, but it’s moving it.”

Kest crouches, eyes flicking between hinge-top and the syrup line. “COUNT SEVEN—pressure steady. COUNT EIGHT—no pin rise. Syrup’s moving left—slow.”

The warden heaps dust and splinters onto the floor where the cloth leads. The syrup hits the debris and turns into a tarry sludge instead of a slick pool—good for traction, bad because it starts to *pile*. It doesn’t spread as fast now, but the mass grows like a clogged drain.

On the other side of the door, the pushing changes: a heavy shove, then a pause, then another shove—testing whether the syrup can be forced through faster. The keyhole drip thickens from a thread to a steady ooze. The cloth trough holds for the moment, but it begins to sag under the weight, fibers stretching.

Then—sharp and unmistakable—a *match-scratch* sound from the other side. A faint sulfur sting leaks through the keyhole area.

Kest snaps, immediate. “COUNT NINE—tool change. I heard fire.”

The free warden freezes for a half-beat, then shifts his grip on the chain clamp as if bracing for a jolt. “If they light that syrup—”

A tiny ember-glow flashes at the keyhole seam, brief as a blink, like someone trying to touch flame to whatever’s seeping through. The threat is clear now: they’re attempting to ignite the syrup or use heat to ruin the cloth pack and trough, forcing an opening or smoking you out.

“Kest—call ‘FIRE’ the instant you see glow again. Warden, keep that chain tight—do not move off the clamp.”

“Mark—stay back and cover your mouth. If you’ve got water, piss, anything liquid, get it ready but don’t crawl forward.”

I snap, “Tear the cloth trough away from the door—leave the keyhole pack, but get the wick off it. Now—smother the keyhole seam with *dust*, not cloth; pack ash, grit, wet mud if we can make it.” I keep my shoulder pinned to the hinge and add, low, “If they light it, we choke it—no air, no fuel.”

*Agent reasoning: Fire at the keyhole could turn the syrup into a fuse and the cloth into tinder; safest is to deny oxygen and remove combustibles near the seam while keeping the hinge secured. I should also check if we have anything nonflammable (stone dust, wet cloth, metal) to smother the ignition point without exposing hands.*

#### Turn 199 **[GAME]**

Kest shifts closer to the keyhole line of sight without abandoning the hinge. “Understood. I see glow, I call FIRE.”

The free warden keeps the chain clamp locked, jaw clenched. “Clamp stays. I’m not moving.”

Mark, farther back, pulls his sleeve over his mouth and nose. “No water.” A pause, then, grim: “I can—if needed.” You hear him fumble at his belt, getting ready without coming forward.

At your snap, the free warden can’t comply—he’s anchored to the chain. The *other* warden (the one not clamping, down by the keyhole) acts instead: he yanks the cloth trough away from the door in one hard pull. The syrup-soaked linen peels off the stone with a sticky sound and drops into the debris pile where it immediately begins to glisten and slump.

The ooze at the keyhole, no longer wicked away, beads—then runs straight down the door face again, thick and glossy.

The warden grabs a double handful of dust and splinters and slaps it against the keyhole seam, grinding it in with the flat of his palm wrapped in a scrap of cloth so he doesn’t touch the syrup bare. It cakes into a gritty crust over the seam. A second handful follows, heavier—enough to choke the tiny gap.

For a breath, the drip slows.

Then the match-scratch comes again—closer, more deliberate. Kest barks, sharp as a bell: “FIRE!”

A pinpoint glow flares at the edge of the keyhole seam—immediately dulled by the dust-cake—but the syrup that has already run down the door catches anyway. It doesn’t whoosh; it *crawls*: a low, greasy line of flame licking along the glossy trail on the door face and down toward the floor.

Heat blooms against your shin and the warden’s hands. The air takes on a bitter, sweet-burn smell that claws at the throat.

The flame reaches the sludge pile where the torn trough landed. The soaked cloth there smolders, then gives a small hungry flare—brief but bright—before choking itself in black smoke.

Threat, clear and present: the syrup trail on the door is now actively burning and producing smoke; if it spreads to the larger syrup mass on the floor or reaches the hinge-plank, it could weaken your brace or force you to abandon position.

#### Turn 200 **[PLAYER]**

“Kest—call where the flame’s headed: hinge-plank or floor pool. Mark—keep back; if you piss, do it into a cup/cloth and pass it, don’t crawl.”

To the nearest warden: “Dump dust—NOW—right on the burning line, heavy. Smother, don’t swipe.”  

Still pinned to the hinge, I hook my free hand to scrape at the syrup trail *above* the flame with the edge of the bar/chisel—break the glossy ‘wick’ into dry wood/stone—then bark, “Once it’s broken, bury the break in grit so it can’t rejoin!”

*Agent reasoning: Fire and smoke will force us off the hinge; we need to smother the crawling flame without introducing more fuel, keep the clamp, and protect breathing. Best is dust/earth/sand to choke it, and break the syrup trail so it can’t keep feeding. Also check if any stone/metal can be used as a scraper while staying pinned.*

#### Turn 201 **[GAME]**

Kest’s head snaps between hinge and floor. “It’s crawling DOWN—floor pool first. Hinge-plank’s still clear, but the heat’s climbing.”

The nearest warden doesn’t swipe—he obeys exactly. He scoops dust and splinters with both hands and *dumps* it straight onto the burning line on the door face. The flame gutters immediately, turning into a dull orange creep under a collapsing crust. Smoke thickens for a second as it’s starved, then the visible fire on the door *goes out* in two uneven patches.

But the fire doesn’t end—it relocates. The syrup that already dripped to the floor has a small tongue of flame at its edge, and when the dust falls, it pushes burning droplets down into the sludge pile. The pile gives a brief flare again, then collapses into a smoking, tar-black mass that keeps *glowing* in pinpricks like embers in pitch.

You keep your shoulder pinned to the hinge and scrape above the extinguished line with the iron edge—chisel or bar—shaving the glossy syrup off stone/wood in rough strips. It works: you break the “wick” into dry patches that won’t carry flame. The scraping throws up hot, sticky flecks; one lands on your sleeve and smears, stinging through fabric before cooling into a tacky spot.

“Break made!” the warden says, and immediately buries the scraped gap in grit, grinding it down with his boot heel until it’s a matte, dusty scar instead of a sheen.

Mark’s voice, farther back, tight and muffled: “I can—” He stops to cough. “I’m filling cloth.” You hear him retch-gag once as the smoke reaches him, then the wet sound of him soaking something off to the side.

Consequence: the door-face flame is smothered and the syrup “wick” is broken, but the floor sludge is now a smoldering, ember-pricked tar that’s producing thick smoke and could reignite if fed air or fresh syrup. The keyhole seam, under dust, still oozes slowly—meaning more fuel is still arriving.

#### Turn 202 **[PLAYER]**

“Kest—watch that pin and the keyhole; if the ooze speeds up, say so. Warden on the chain, don’t you budge.”

To the nearest warden, low and sharp: “Don’t kick it—cover the smoldering sludge with *stone dust* and any damp you can find, slow and thick, like burying coals. We need it sealed from air.”

I cough into my sleeve, keep my shoulder on the hinge, and rasp, “Mark—good. Pass that soaked cloth *away from the door*; we’ll use it to cap smoke near us, not feed flame at the seam.”

Then, without lifting off, I angle my boot to scrape a shallow moat of grit between the door and the sludge pile. “Make a dry break-line on the floor—no syrup bridge. If the drip resumes, it hits the break and dies.”

*Agent reasoning: The immediate danger is smoke and a smoldering fuel source that can reignite; I should reduce oxygen, contain embers, and stop more syrup from feeding the fire while keeping the hinge brace intact.*

#### Turn 203 **[GAME]**

Kest shifts his stance to keep one eye on the keyhole area without leaving the hinge line. “Pin’s steady. Ooze is—” he leans, squints as another bead forms, “—still slow. Not surging.”

The chain-warden answers through clenched teeth, knuckles white on the clamp. “Not budging.”

At your instruction, the nearest warden stops using his boot entirely. He drags a rack-slat through the dust like a hoe, pulling pale stone grit over the ember-pricked sludge in slow heaps. It lands with soft *thumps*, and the pinprick glows dim under the new layer. He adds more until the mound is thick enough to hold its shape.

But the sludge is hot: the dust begins to *steam* in thin wisps, and the smell changes—less sweet-burn, more bitter tar. Smoke output drops for a moment… then puffs out through a tiny crack at the mound’s edge as trapped gases find a vent.

Mark, still back, crawls sideways along the wall—away from the door like you ordered—then extends an arm to slide a soaked cloth across the floor toward you. He never approaches the seam. “Here—wet. It’s—” he coughs hard, “—it’s piss.”

You scrape your boot and carve a shallow moat between the door and the buried sludge: a crescent of bare stone with a ridge of grit on your side. The nearest warden reinforces it, dragging more dust into a raised berm.

Outcome: you successfully create a dry break-line so any new drip has to cross bare stone before reaching the buried pile.

Consequence: the keyhole seam continues to ooze—slow, steady—and now the syrup hits the break-line and starts to *pool* on the door-side of the moat, forming a glossy, growing puddle that is unlit but very much fuel. The buried sludge is mostly smothered, yet it’s still hot enough to vent occasional smoke through cracks; if fresh syrup reaches it, it could reignite.

Threat: you’re buying time, not ending the hazard—fuel is accumulating again at the base of the door, and the other side has already shown they can introduce flame through the seam.

#### Turn 204 **[PLAYER]**

“Kest—keep eyes on the keyhole; if you hear match-scratch or see glow, scream FIRE again. Also listen—are they moving away, or setting up something heavier?”

I nod at the puddle by the moat. “Warden—use the rack-slat to shove a *dust dam* right under the drip so it spreads wide and thin, not deep. No cloth near the seam.”

I take Mark’s soaked cloth with two fingers, wrap it around the end of the chisel like a cap, and press it down onto the *puddle only* on our side of the moat—smothering and cooling it in place. “Mark, good—stay back. If you can, find more liquid and keep it ready.”

Without lifting my shoulder from the hinge, I rasp to the chain-warden, “How long can you hold that clamp before your hands fail? Give me a number.”

*Agent reasoning: Fuel is accumulating again and they can ignite it through the seam; we need to deny ignition and stop/redirect the ooze without disturbing the hinge brace. Wet cloth can cool/smother the puddle, but must be kept away from the keyhole to avoid wicking. Also need to learn what’s on the other side—listen for tool changes.*

#### Turn 205 **[GAME]**

Kest puts his ear close to the seam, head turned so one eye still watches the keyhole crust. “No scratch yet.” He stills, listening harder. “Footsteps—backing off. Two sets. They’re not running; they’re… giving themselves room.” His voice tightens. “That’s ‘heavier’.”

The warden with the rack-slat obeys. He wedges the slat’s edge into the dust and builds a small berm directly under where the drip lands, shaping it into a shallow fan. The next bead of syrup hits the dam and spreads sideways instead of dropping into a deep puddle—thin, glossy, and wider, like varnish.

You take Mark’s soaked cloth with two fingers, cap the chisel tip, and press it down onto the pooled syrup on *your* side of the moat. It hisses faintly as the warmth meets wet cloth. The syrup underneath dulls from glossy to matte in patches as dust and moisture mix into a tacky paste. The immediate effect is good: it stops the puddle from flowing and lowers the chance a fresh spark will skitter across it.

Consequence: the cloth begins to *stick*. When you lift even slightly to reposition, strings of syrup cling and pull, trying to drag the wet cloth back toward the door-side fuel. It’s controllable, but it wants to bridge if you’re sloppy.

Mark stays back, coughing less now that the smoke has thinned. “I’ll—” cough, “—see if there’s a bucket. Or a chamber pot. Don’t move me.”

The chain-warden answers your question without looking up. “Two minutes. Maybe three.” His hands tremble visibly at the clamp. “After that my fingers go dead and the chain slips, and I’m not guessing which.”

Then—faint but distinct—wood scrapes on wood from the far side of the door, like something long being dragged into position. Kest goes rigid. “They’re setting a brace. Or a ram.”

Threat, clear: the other side is preparing a heavier forced entry. Your clamp-holder is on a short clock, and if the door takes a full hit while syrup continues to ooze at the seam, you risk both structural failure and renewed ignition.

#### Turn 206 **[PLAYER]**

“Kest—call the rhythm the instant they start their run-up; I want a count to the hit.”

To the free warden: “Get behind me and brace the hinge-plank with your shoulder—stack your weight into it. If there’s a table, bench, anything solid, drag it in as a deadman brace against the door—*now*.”

I rasp to the chain-warden, “On my mark you rotate hands—one at a time—don’t let the chain slack. We’ll trade you out if we can.”

Keeping my shoulder planted, I peel the sticky wet cloth off the chisel carefully and drop it flat over the *matte paste* only—no dragging—then grind dust into the remaining gloss with the chisel edge. “No clean syrup lines. Nothing for flame to run.”

Then, low to Mark: “Forget searching—stay put. If the door goes, you run for the stairwell and shout alarm.”

*Agent reasoning: A ram is coming and our clamp-holder is near collapse; I need to redistribute load, improve bracing, and reduce fire risk before impact while gathering intel on what they’re doing.*

#### Turn 207 **[GAME]**

Kest nods once, jaw set, and keeps his ear close to the seam. “I’ll count.”

The free warden moves in behind you immediately, shoulder-to-shoulder but staggered so he can stack weight into the hinge-plank without knocking you off it. He plants his boots wide on the gritty stone and leans in. “Got you.”

He glances around for anything solid. There’s no table—just storage racks bolted to the wall and the low service hatch at the passage end. He hooks his arm around the nearest rack upright and tries to wrench it free; it doesn’t budge. The bolts hold. “Nothing loose. Racks are fixed!”

At the chain, the clamped warden swallows and nods, eyes glassy with strain. He shifts one hand a hair, testing the edge of failure. “On your mark.”

You manage the wet cloth cleanly: you peel it off without dragging a syrup-string back toward the seam, drop it flat over the tacky matte paste, and grind dust into the remaining gloss with the chisel edge. The door-side syrup fan is now mostly dulled and gritty; there are no clean, continuous shiny “lanes” for flame to race along.

Mark answers with a hoarse, “Understood,” and crawls another half-body length away from the door, closer to the direction of the stairwell.

Then the other side commits.

Kest’s head snaps up. “Run-up—NOW. One—two—three—”

On “three” the door takes a *full-body* impact: a deep, chest-rattling THUD that shudders through hinge and plank. Dust jumps off the racks. The hinge-plank flexes under your shoulders; the warden behind you grunts as the force tries to peel you both off the brace.

The chain goes taut with a metallic *twang*. The clamp-warden’s hands slip a fraction—just a fraction—before he bites down again, wrists shaking violently. “Still—holding!”

A thin line of grit at the keyhole seam cracks and a fresh bead of syrup squeezes out faster than before, pushed by the shock. It runs into your dust dam and spreads, but it’s now coming *steadier*—not a single bead.

Kest, eyes wide, listens again. “They’re backing up for another. Heavier this time.”

Threat: a second impact is imminent, and the last hit increased the ooze rate; if the door or chain gives, you’ll have a forced entry into a smoke-hazed, syrup-smeared threshold where a single spark could re-light everything.

#### Turn 208 **[PLAYER]**

“Mark—GO. Stairwell, now. Shout alarm, ‘syrup-fire at the service door,’ don’t stop.”

“Kest—keep counting; if you hear them shift from run-up to *ram* setup, tell me. Warden behind me, lock in—feet wide, don’t let the plank walk.”

To the clamp-warden, sharp: “On my mark, rotate right hand off for one breath—shake it—back on. Left stays clamped. Mark—NOW.” 

I jerk my chin at the bolted racks. “Free warden—rip a slat loose if you can; wedge it under the hinge-plank as a chock. If nothing breaks, shove your boot hard against the plank base and hold it like a stop.”

I cough, then scrape a fresh load of dust and grit up into a thick ridge directly under the keyhole seam. “If the ooze surges on the next hit, we bury it—no clean trail, no flame path.”

*Agent reasoning: Another heavier hit could break the door or chain; I need an exit plan and to reduce fire risk. I should get Mark moving to raise alarm, reinforce bracing with what’s available, and manage the clamp-warden’s imminent hand failure by rotating or swapping someone in.*

#### Turn 209 **[GAME]**

Mark doesn’t argue. He scrambles up from his crouch and half-runs, half-staggers down the passage toward the stairwell, one hand clamped over his mouth. His shout starts as a rasp and turns into a raw bellow as he gains distance: “ALARM—SYRUP-FIRE AT THE SERVICE DOOR—ALARM!” His footsteps fade, then echo again as he hits stairs.

Kest stays glued to the seam. “Listening.”

The warden behind you locks in harder—boots splayed, hips low, shoulder driving into the hinge-plank so it can’t “walk” sideways. “Plank’s steady. I’ll take the hit.”

At the clamp, you call the rotation. The chain-warden nods once, then peels his right hand off for a single breath. The chain shivers—audibly—and the clamp creaks, but his left hand holds. He shakes the right hand violently, fingers clawing open and shut once, then slams it back on. “Back.” His voice is thin with pain, but the clamp remains engaged; no slack is given.

The free warden goes for the racks. He jams fingers under a slat and yanks until his knuckles split; the wood groans but doesn’t come free—then, with a sharp crack, a thinner crosspiece snaps instead. He snatches the broken length and drops to wedge it under the hinge-plank as a chock. It bites awkwardly into the uneven stone, but it does add a stop. “Chock in!”

You scrape and heap fresh dust and grit into a thick ridge under the keyhole seam. The syrup that’s already oozing hits the ridge and spreads into it, turning the top layer into a sticky, gritty crust.

Then Kest stiffens. “They’re not backing for a run-up.” He tilts his head, listening to the other side’s movements. “They’re *building*. Wood on wood. Something being set across—”

A low, synchronized grunt comes through the door—several voices. The door shudders once, not from impact but from pressure testing.

Threat: they’ve shifted to a braced ram or lever. Instead of one big hit, you’re about to face sustained, coordinated force that will steadily defeat the hinge-plank and the clamp unless relieved—while the keyhole seam continues to ooze faster with every vibration.

#### Turn 9 **[GAME]**

Morning, low tide, at the **Junction of Nine**—a ring of half-submerged service platforms where four maintenance corridors meet under a cracked transit atrium. Salt-stale air hangs heavy. Water slaps the stairwell below, then sucks back, dragging grit. Your headlamp beam catches blistered paint and a curtain of dripping cable.

You kneel on a dry patch of poured concrete and unroll your waterlogged utility sheets on a rusted cable tray. The paper fights you, swollen and soft. You pin corners with bolts from your pocket and mark a new line with a grease pencil: a bypass around a collapsed pump room, measured by count and slope like you’re back in a survey crew. You check ceiling seams for fresh seep and tap a conduit with your wrench—listening for hollow, for hidden voids.

Boots scrape behind you. Three people step into the light: a Tidewarden in a patched dive coat with an air-hose looped over one shoulder; a thin Choir tech with a handheld meter and copper token chain; and a Rebar Court bailiff with a rebar baton and a slate board. They don’t look at each other. They look at your maps.

The bailiff flips the slate toward you. Your name is chalked under a stamped seal: **SALVAGE WRIT—STOLEN INFRASTRUCTURE**. “Court says you return what you took,” he says, baton resting across his forearm. The Tidewarden cuts in, voice calm. “We can make that go away. Air credit, a dry corridor. You come talk to our captain.” The Choir tech raises the meter; its needle trembles. “No talk,” she says. “Verification. Now. You have something that sings upland.”

Then you see it: on the pillar beside the north tunnel, a fresh stenciled mark—new paint, wrong code—half-hidden under algae smear. And from the flooded shaft below the atrium comes the same rhythmic banging, closer than yesterday, steady as a pump that won’t prime.

All three wait, blocking three exits. Your maps are open, your pack is at your feet, and the ceramic isolator is a hard weight against your ribs. You have seconds to choose who you face—and whether you move before the banging reaches the stairs.

#### Turn 10 **[PLAYER]**

I snap my maps up in one motion, shove them into my coat, and kick my pack strap onto my shoulder. “You can all file your paperwork after we’re not dead—move.” I feint toward the bailiff’s side like I’m surrendering, then cut hard for the north tunnel, headlamp sweeping the fresh stencil as I run.

*Agent reasoning: Three factions want leverage; none matter if whatever’s banging reaches us. Fastest path is the unblocked exit—north—with the weird fresh stencil as a clue. Create a split-second distraction, grab essentials, move.*

#### Turn 11 **[GAME]**

Your maps slap together wetly as you snap them up; the paper nearly tears at a fold, but you get it bundled and jammed under your coat. The pack strap catches, then slides onto your shoulder with a jolt that knocks your headlamp beam sideways across the pillar.

“Move,” you bark.

The bailiff reads the feint as compliance for half a heartbeat—his baton dips—then you cut hard. His eyes widen and he lunges, rebar baton swinging low for your shin. It clips your boot instead of bone, sparks off a metal edge, and you stumble but keep your feet.

The Tidewarden reacts faster than the others: he steps across the north tunnel mouth, blocking it with his shoulder and the looped air-hose like a garrote. “No,” he says, flat. He grabs for your coat front.

You slam into him at speed. Your shoulder drives him back a step onto slick silt; his boots skid. The Choir tech doesn’t chase—she raises her meter and snaps two short words that sound like procedure, not a prayer. The needle pegs, and your headlamp flickers once, then steadies—like something just drank a bite of current nearby.

Your beam catches the fresh stencil in full as you pass it: the same wrong-code mark, painted over old flake, still glossy at the edges. Under it, someone has scratched a tiny arrow pointing deeper into the north tunnel.

Behind you, the bailiff shouts, “Writ in force! Stop her!” He’s coming, heavy-footed. The Tidewarden, off-balance, recovers and reaches again—fingers snagging your pack strap. The strap bites into his hand; he yanks, trying to pull you back into the atrium.

Then the banging changes: not below anymore. It answers from inside the north tunnel—two impacts, a pause, two impacts—close enough you feel it through the concrete.

Ahead, the north corridor is half-lit by your lamp: a maintenance run with hanging cable bundles and a shallow sheet of water over the floor. Fifty feet in, something pale breaks the surface and slides back under—fast, deliberate—leaving a V-wake through scum.

You are not clear yet. The Tidewarden has your strap, the bailiff is closing, and whatever is making that rhythm is now in the tunnel with you.

#### Turn 12 **[PLAYER]**

I hiss, “Keep it,” and knife the pack strap free so it drops into his hands and the water. Then I sprint deeper, jump for the nearest wall ladder/cable tray supports to get my boots out of the sheet water, and keep moving above the surface toward the scratched arrow.

*Agent reasoning: Strap grab will get me pinned between hunters and whatever’s in the water; fastest is to ditch weight, break contact, get to high ground off the flooded floor.*

#### Turn 13 **[GAME]**

Your knife flashes. You hook the strap where it crosses your chest and saw once, hard. The webbing parts with a dry snap.

The pack drops straight into the Tidewarden’s hands and then into the sheet water with a heavy slap. He grunts—more surprised than hurt—then immediately clamps both hands on it like it’s evidence. “Fine,” he spits, and you hear the hose on his shoulder clack as he turns back toward the atrium, already calling, “She ditched her load—north tunnel!”

You sprint. The shallow water tries to steal your boots with every step, but you hit the wall and jump, fingers catching a corroded cable tray support and a rung of an old side-ladder bolted into the concrete. Rust flakes into your palms. The first rung flexes; it holds.

You haul yourself up and start moving sideways and forward along the ladder line, boots scraping for purchase on narrow brackets just above the waterline. Below you, something moves again—pale, quick—tracking the line of your shadow more than your body. It bumps the wall once, hard, and the vibration shivers up the ladder into your arms.

Behind, the bailiff enters the tunnel mouth and stops short when he sees you climb. “Get down!” he barks, baton raised like it can reach you. He won’t wade in fast; he keeps to the dry edge, scanning.

Ahead, you follow the scratched arrow. Twenty feet deeper, it points to a service recess: a metal access panel half-hidden behind hanging cable bundles. The panel’s bolts are newer than everything around it—clean heads, bright edges. Someone has been here recently.

The rhythmic banging is right under that recess now, from inside the wall or the flooded cavity behind it: two hits, pause, two hits—patient and close.

As you reach the recess, the ladder section you’re on gives a sharp creak. One of the brackets has pulled a few millimeters out of the concrete, leaving a fresh crescent of crumbling aggregate. If you keep your full weight on it much longer, it’s going to tear free.

```json
{"inventory_remove":["pack (with any contents)"],"inventory_add":[],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":["Junction of Nine - North Tunnel"],"npcs_add":["Tidewarden diver (unnamed)","Rebar Court bailiff (unnamed)","Catenary Choir tech (unnamed)"]}
```

#### Turn 14 **[PLAYER]**

I shift my weight back, then lunge into the recess, grabbing cables for leverage as I plant both boots on whatever dry lip I can find. “Bailiff—stay out of the water unless you want it on you,” I snap, and immediately start wrenching at the newer bolts on the access panel with my knife/wrench, fast and sloppy.

*Agent reasoning: Ladder’s failing and something’s in the water; fastest is to get off the bracket, get into the recess, and use the new bolts/panel as the intended route—also blocks pursuit.*

#### Turn 15 **[GAME]**

You shift your weight back just enough to unhook from the failing bracket, then lunge. Your hands fist a bundle of hanging cables—rubber slick with condensation—and you swing into the recess. Your boots find a narrow dry lip: a raised concrete curb inside the alcove. It holds. The ladder behind you gives a final protesting groan but doesn’t tear out—not yet.

“Bailiff—stay out of the water unless you want it on you,” you snap.

The bailiff halts at the edge, eyes flicking to the water where the pale shape just traced another fast line under the scum. He swallows, then tries to save face by lifting his baton toward you like a gavel. “You’re under writ,” he says, but he doesn’t step in.

You get your wrench on the first new bolt. The head is clean, not rounded—whoever set it wanted it removable. Fast and sloppy works for the first two: they squeal and come free, dropping into the recess with sharp pings.

On the third, your wrench slips—your hand is wet, the rubber cable jacket smears against your palm—and you skin your knuckles on the panel edge. Blood beads immediately in the cold air.

The banging stops.

For a half-second there’s only the drip of cable and your breathing—then something hits the access panel from behind, hard. The metal bows outward with a dull *thoom* and rebounds. Dust puffs from the seam. The remaining bolts jump in their holes.

Below your boots, in the waterline at the recess mouth, the pale thing surfaces long enough for you to see it: not a fish. A forearm—human, swollen and bleached—ending in a hand that shouldn’t still have grip. It hooks fingers into the recess’s lower edge and pulls, steady and purposeful, as if it heard the bolt squeal and homed in on it.

Behind you, from the tunnel mouth, the Tidewarden’s voice carries closer now, urgent. “Don’t open anything! Kestrel—step away from the panel!”

The bailiff takes one involuntary step back from the water, baton up, and says quieter, “What the hell is that?”

The access panel bulges again—two impacts, pause, two impacts—now coming from directly behind it, like something is testing the last fasteners. Your next wrench-turn will either open it… or leave you in a recess with a climbing hand at your feet and whatever’s inside the wall trying to get out.

#### Turn 16 **[PLAYER]**

I yank my bleeding hand back, wipe it on my sleeve, and kick the loose bolts into the water at the pale hand. “Congrats—your writ can arrest that,” I bark at the bailiff, then shove off the recess lip and move fast along the wall supports past the arrow, keeping my boots out of the water and my eyes on the surface for another grab.

*Agent reasoning: Opening that panel is a gamble with a thing already trying to get out; speedrun move is disengage, use the bailiff/Tidewarden as distraction, and get past the threat via the marked route without feeding it blood.*

#### Turn 17 **[GAME]**

You wipe the blood off on your sleeve; it smears dark and wet. You hook a boot under the two loose bolts and flick them out.

They plink into the sheet water and skip once, right toward the pale hand. The hand flinches—not away, but down—submerging with a quick, practiced dip. The bolts vanish under the scum with it.

“Congrats—your writ can arrest that,” you bark.

The bailiff’s face tightens. He raises the baton like he’s about to answer—then the water near the recess dimples and slides, and he chooses distance instead. “Court doesn’t cover… *that*,” he mutters, backing toward the tunnel mouth without taking his eyes off the surface.

You shove off the recess lip and catch the wall supports again, moving fast. The bracket line shudders under your weight; rust flakes rain into the water. You keep your boots off the surface, skimming along narrow metal tabs and ladder rungs.

Behind you, the access panel gives a long, ugly groan—metal flexing. A seam opens a finger-width with a sound like tearing foil. Something inside exhales a breath of warmer air that fogs the recess for an instant.

Then the water answers: a sudden surge straight up at the recess mouth. The pale arm comes out higher than before, not grabbing blindly—reaching for the supports you’re using. Fingers rake the wall, miss your heel by inches, and slap back into the water with a loud smack.

Ahead, past the arrow, the wall supports continue—but the next section is partially collapsed: two rungs are missing, leaving a gap over the water about the length of your body. Beyond the gap, the tunnel bends left into darker conduit haze.

From behind, the Tidewarden is closer now, boots splashing at the edge where the water is thinnest. He shouts, “Mara! Don’t—” and then cuts off as the water near him ripples in a straight line, moving away from the recess and toward the tunnel mouth like something is redirecting.

The threat is immediate and specific now: the thing in the water is learning your route along the wall, and you’ve got a rung-gap coming up that will force a jump or a drop—right as the surface starts to move toward the people behind you.

#### Turn 18 **[PLAYER]**

I commit to the jump—hands to the last solid rung, swing my legs and launch across the missing section to catch the far rung/bracket, hauling up without touching the water. “Back up, Tidewarden—it's tracking movement on the wall!” I shout over my shoulder, then keep moving into the left bend, headlamp low on the waterline watching for another grab.

*Agent reasoning: Gap jump is faster than dropping into water; I’ll use the pursuing ripples to my advantage by forcing the others to back off and buying myself seconds.*

#### Turn 19 **[GAME]**

You commit. Both hands clamp the last solid rung; you swing your legs hard to build momentum, then launch.

For a half-second you’re over open water and nothing else—then your fingers catch the far bracket. It bites into your palms through rust and grit. The bracket flexes and spits a little concrete dust, but it holds. You kick once against the wall, get a boot on a narrow tab, and haul your weight up without breaking the surface.

Your headlamp beam, kept low, skates over the waterline. You catch a pale streak just under the film, pacing you—too smooth to be floating drift.

“Back up, Tidewarden—it’s tracking movement on the wall!” you shout.

The Tidewarden, now visible at the edge behind the bailiff, hesitates mid-step. He lifts his hands as if to steady himself, then actually does back up two paces onto higher rubble. “Bull,” he calls, but his voice cracks on the last word. He’s watching the water, not you.

The bailiff uses the moment to retreat another step, baton lowered. “You hear her,” he snaps at the diver, then, softer, “Don’t be stupid.”

You keep moving into the left bend. The air changes immediately—less open tunnel, more enclosed conduit. The wall supports continue but are slicker here, coated in algae smear where the mist never dries. Your lamp reveals drag marks on the concrete at shoulder height, as if something heavy has been hauled along the wall recently.

Behind you, metal shrieks: the access panel finally gives way. It doesn’t explode outward; it peels open with a slow, wrenching tear and then *clangs* against something inside. A breath of dry, warm air rolls down the tunnel—cleaner than it should be.

The water reacts as if a current turned on. The surface pulls toward the bend you’re entering, tugging floating grit with it in a thin, steady stream. The pale shape follows that pull, accelerating.

Then the grab comes—not from below your feet, but from the wall itself ahead: a hand shoots out of a fist-sized maintenance hole at knee height, fingers snapping for your boot as you pass. It misses by a hair and scrapes rust off the bracket with a shrill *skrrt*.

Whatever is in here isn’t just in the water anymore. It’s using the wall cavities—and it’s now between you and the deeper dark of the bend.

#### Turn 20 **[PLAYER]**

I jerk back, then stomp my heel hard into the maintenance hole to crush fingers/force it shut, and immediately climb up to the highest reachable rung to get above knee-level. Headlamp swings ahead hunting for the nearest side hatch/valve niche to duck into and slam closed behind me.

*Agent reasoning: Wall-grabber means this path is compromised; speedrun move is to break line-of-contact and get vertical or into a side hatch fast, not keep pacing along predictable brackets.*

#### Turn 21 **[GAME]**

You jerk back and drive your heel into the maintenance hole.

Your boot hits fingers—there’s resistance like wet rope over bone—then a crack you feel up your shin. The hand spasms and withdraws, leaving a smear of pale skin and dark fluid on the rim. Your heel wedges for a beat, then you wrench it free; the hole is still open, but whatever was in it isn’t reaching anymore.

You climb—fast, ugly—up to the highest rung you can reach. The algae-slick metal tries to throw you, but you get both hands locked and pull your chest above knee-level. You’re now a full rung-and-a-half higher than before, boots planted on a narrow crosspiece, shoulders near the ceiling line.

Your headlamp swings ahead and catches a side niche: an old valve recess cut into the wall about six meters forward, half-height, with a corroded wheel and a steel access door hanging slightly ajar on one hinge. It’s not sealed; it’s a place to duck, not a bunker.

The water below you is moving with intent now—streaming toward the bend. The pale thing breaks the surface briefly, not fully emerging: just enough to show a slack jaw and one eye filmed over, then it submerges again and slides along the wall under your supports as if following the fastest line.

Behind you, the torn access panel clatters again. Something bumps it from the other side, testing the opening. Warm air continues to breathe out in pulses, like a vent line cycling.

The Tidewarden’s voice echoes from back down the tunnel, farther now—he really did retreat. “Kestrel! Get out of there—Court won’t pay your lungs back!”

As you shift your weight to move toward the valve niche, the rung you’re on gives a sharp *ping*. One of its anchor points has started to pull from the concrete—freshly stressed by your climb. You can keep moving, but the supports are no longer “safe”; they’re actively failing under you, one load at a time.

#### Turn 22 **[PLAYER]**

I lunge along the supports to the valve recess and drop into it, planting both boots on the niche’s concrete lip. I shoulder-check the hanging steel door to swing it as closed as it’ll go and jam my wrench through the wheel/spokes as a crude brace, then flick my headlamp down the waterline and listen for the next grab.

*Agent reasoning: The supports are failing; I need stable ground fast. The valve niche is the nearest “platform,” even if it won’t seal—use it to get off the rungs and buy seconds to choose the next route.*

#### Turn 23 **[GAME]**

You lunge along the supports—one, two rungs—then drop into the valve recess.

Your boots hit the concrete lip solidly. The niche is just deep enough to get your shoulders out of the tunnel’s main line, and the air inside is drier, dustier. Rust scabs flake off the valve wheel when you grab it.

You shoulder-check the hanging steel door. It swings inward with a grinding shriek, but the bottom edge drags on warped concrete and stops with a fist-wide gap still open near the floor. The hinge is half-sheared; the door won’t seat.

You reach for your wrench on instinct—then your hand closes on empty belt webbing.

You don’t have a wrench.

The realization costs you a beat. You shove the valve wheel instead, trying to use the spokes as a brace point, but the wheel turns freely a quarter turn with a wet, internal gurgle. Somewhere behind the wall, water shifts. The wheel isn’t locked; it’s connected to something that still moves.

You flick your headlamp down the waterline through the gap.

The surface outside the recess is sliding past like a slow conveyor. Then it stops—right at your doorway gap—as if a current hit a dead-end. The film trembles.

A pale hand rises from the water and finds the bottom edge of the door immediately, fingers feeling along the gap with purpose. Not searching the tunnel—searching *you*. Nails click on steel.

Above that hand, under the scum, a face presses up again, closer: slack mouth working soundlessly, one eye milked over, the other fixed on the light beam. It doesn’t lunge; it waits, holding the door edge like it’s testing how much give it has.

From the tunnel behind, you hear a metallic thump—different from the water-slap. The torn access panel being struck again, harder, and then a second sound: a short burst of rapid tapping, like knuckles on conduit, answering itself in the bend.

The Tidewarden’s voice is distant now, muffled by the curve. “Mara—? You alive?”

The immediate threat is at the gap: the thing has purchase on the door and is starting to pull, slow and steady, while your “brace” is a valve wheel that can still turn—and may be opening something you don’t want opened.

#### Turn 24 **[PLAYER]**

I stomp down on the pale fingers through the gap, then yank off my belt/strap and ram it into the door’s bottom as a crude wedge. “Alive—moving,” I shout toward the Tidewarden, then kill my headlamp and slip back out of the niche onto the wall supports, pushing into the bend as fast as I can without touching the water.

*Agent reasoning: Door won’t seal and I lost my wrench; fastest is to deny it the gap and get moving. Valve wheel is risky—stop turning it. Use whatever’s on me to jam the bottom and bail out before it pulls through.*

#### Turn 25 **[GAME]**

Your boot comes down hard on the fingers probing the gap. Bone gives with a brittle snap; the hand spasms and slips, leaving two crushed digits caught for a moment under the door edge before the rest withdraws into the water.

You rip your belt free and ram the strap into the bottom gap, folding it over itself and stuffing it tight like a gasket. The door shudders as you shove; the hinge squeals, but the strap takes up most of the space. It’s not airtight, but it’s enough to deny a clean reach-through.

“Alive—moving!” your shout bounces down the tunnel.

The Tidewarden answers immediately, closer than you thought: boots scraping, not running but repositioning. “Copy! Don’t go dark—” he starts, then cuts himself off as if realizing you already might.

You kill your headlamp.

Dark snaps shut like a fist. In the first second, you’ve got only afterimages: the doorway rectangle, the sheen of water.

You slip back out onto the wall supports by feel. Your hands find the cold metal; you swing a boot onto the crosspiece and push into the bend.

The supports betray you almost immediately. The rung you load gives a sharp, tearing *krk* as its anchor pulls another centimeter out of the concrete. You catch yourself with your forearms, scraping skin, and keep moving—faster now because stopping will drop you.

Below, the waterline sounds change: less slosh, more deliberate scraping as something tracks the wall right under you. Twice you feel a faint vibration through the support brackets, like knuckles tapping from the other side of the concrete.

Behind you, the valve door in the niche bangs once—hard—then again, slower. The strap wedge holds, but each hit makes the hinge complain.

Ahead, in the bend, you smell it before you see it: dry dust and hot metal. A faint, steady hum—electrical, not wind—threads through the dark. Then your shin clips something hanging from the ceiling: a loop of cable or wire, swaying. It brushes your leg and continues to swing, ticking softly against a bracket.

And in that same moment, something in the water surges forward under you, fast enough to throw a small wave against the wall. The splash hits the supports; droplets patter on your boots.

You’re in the bend now, moving blind, with failing anchors behind you, a thing pacing below, and a live-sounding hum ahead that could mean power—or a trap.

```

#### Turn 26 **[PLAYER]**

I flick the headlamp on for a quick flash-scan ahead—looking for a dry catwalk, junction box alcove, or door I can get onto—and immediately reach up to yank the hanging cable out of my path. If there’s a dry ledge, I climb up/off the supports onto it; if not, I keep moving forward on the highest brackets, hugging the wall and staying clear of the water.

*Agent reasoning: Blind + failing rungs + live power hum = trip/electrocution risk. Fastest is get light back on briefly, avoid water, and climb off the wall supports onto any dry service ledge/doorway near the power source.*

#### Turn 27 **[GAME]**

You snap the headlamp on—just a heartbeat.

The beam punches through mist and shows the bend opening into a service stretch: a narrow, grated catwalk runs along the right wall about chest-high, bolted into the concrete with stanchions. Half of it is intact and dry; the far section dips where a stanchion has sheared, the grating twisted down toward the water. Above the catwalk is a junction box alcove: a recessed cabinet with its door missing, exposing ceramic insulators and a bundle of blackened conductors. The hum you heard is coming from there—faint, steady, and wrong for a dead district.

In that same flash you also catch the hanging “cable” you clipped: it isn’t loose utility line. It’s a looped length of catenary wire with a ceramic isolator tied in-line—cleaner than the rest, recently handled. It’s been hung deliberately at shin height like a snare.

You reach up and yank it aside.

The wire doesn’t give like slack line; it bites back. It snaps taut and the ceramic isolator swings up and smacks the bracket near your head with a sharp *clack*. The loop whips across your forearm, scraping hard—then the whole rig jerks toward the junction alcove as if it’s tethered there. Something in the box clicks once, like a relay engaging.

The hum rises a notch.

Below you, the water surges again—this time not just a wave. A shoulder or back breaks the surface under the catwalk section, sliding fast. It’s using the wall and your supports like a guide rail, keeping pace with your movement.

You don’t wait. You hook an elbow over the nearest catwalk stanchion and haul yourself up off the failing brackets. The grating is cold and gritty under your boots—dry enough to trust for now. The twisted, sagging section is about four meters ahead; you can see where it drops toward the water like a ramp.

Behind you, from the dark, the Tidewarden’s voice carries closer and sharper: “Light! I saw it—keep it on, I’m coming to you!”

From the junction alcove, you hear a second, softer sound layered under the hum: that same rhythmic tapping you heard earlier—now right here, answering from inside the wall cavity behind the cabinet.

#### Turn 28 **[PLAYER]**

“Stop where you are, Tidewarden—there’s a live snare and a hot box!” I hiss, then lunge into the junction alcove and rip the conductors free from the insulators (yanking anything feeding that hum). Without waiting to see if it dies, I sprint the catwalk and jump the sagging section, grabbing the far stanchion and hauling myself onto the intact grating beyond.

*Agent reasoning: Snare + live power + something in the wall = trap zone. Fastest is to get past the sagging ramp before the water thing uses it; don’t let the Tidewarden blunder in. Disable the box if it’s feeding the snare, then sprint the catwalk.*

#### Turn 29 **[GAME]**



#### Turn 30 **[PLAYER]**

“Stop where you are, Tidewarden—live snare, hot box!” I dart into the junction alcove and yank the feed conductors off the insulators until the hum dies, then sprint the catwalk and leap the sagging section, grabbing the far stanchion to haul myself onto solid grating.

*Agent reasoning: Blank output means the scene didn’t advance; I’ll restate the same fast, high-priority move: warn Tidewarden, kill power at the hot box, clear the catwalk gap.*

#### Turn 31 **[GAME]**

“Stop where you are—live snare, hot box!” your voice comes out thin in the concrete throat, but it carries.

The Tidewarden checks himself mid-step. You hear his boots skid on grit. “Hot?” he barks back, and then—more cautious—“Where?”

You don’t answer. You dive into the junction alcove.

Up close, it’s a butchered cabinet: older ceramic insulators, but the conductors are newer—black jacket intact, lugs recently crimped. Your hands close on the first pair and you rip.

The hum doesn’t die. It *jumps*—a higher pitch—and the cable in your grip kicks like a live animal. A white-blue snap pops at the lug and heat bites your palm. The smell of ozone and burnt rubber blooms instantly.

You wrench again, harder, and the second pull tears a conductor free. This time the hum stutters, drops for half a second… then comes back lower, steadier. Whatever’s feeding it isn’t only this cabinet.

From behind the cabinet, inside the wall void, the tapping accelerates: *tap-tap-tap-tap*—close enough you feel it through the concrete.

Below the catwalk, the thing in the water reacts to the commotion. It surges forward and *hits* the sagging section from underneath. The twisted grating flexes downward with a metallic groan and a spray of brackish water spits up through the gaps.

You’re already moving.

You sprint along the catwalk; the intact grating rattles under your feet. At the sagging break you commit—jumping the dip.

Your boots clear the worst of it, but the far edge is slick with algae. Your hands slap the far stanchion; you catch it, swing, and haul yourself up onto the solid section beyond. The stanchion holds, vibrating from the impact.

Behind you, the sagging section gives another tortured *screee* as something heavy drags along its underside. A pale shape rolls just under the surface—long back, no clear limbs—using the catwalk’s shadow like cover.

The Tidewarden, still back in the tunnel, doesn’t come closer. You hear him unclip something—metal on metal—and he shouts, “Stay there! I’m not stepping into a live run—tell me what you touched!”

In the junction alcove you left, the loose conductor end you tore free spits once more—then goes dark. The hum remains, faint but present, now coming from deeper ahead along the wall, as if the line is still energized somewhere past your position.

#### Turn 32 **[PLAYER]**

I shake my burned hand once, then shout back, “Cabinet’s been re-fed—still hot farther ahead. Snare wire at shin height before the catwalk; don’t touch the wall, don’t step onto the sag.”  
I keep moving forward on the intact grating, headlamp low and sweeping for another junction/door or ladder up, staying as far from the humming wall-run as the catwalk allows.

*Agent reasoning: My hand’s cooked and the line’s still live somewhere ahead; fastest is to avoid the energized wall, keep moving to a safer node, and give the Tidewarden only the essentials so he doesn’t blunder into the snare.*

#### Turn 33 **[GAME]**

You shake your hand; the burn has already raised a wet blister across the base of your thumb and two fingers. Your grip still works, but it stings with every flex.

Your warning echoes back down the tunnel.

The Tidewarden answers immediately, voice tighter. “Copy. I’m backing out.” You hear him retreat—boots on grit, then a splash as he steps off the drier lip into shallow water to widen his path away from the wall. A moment later: the hiss of a valve and the hollow *clunk* of a tank being shouldered. He’s not leaving; he’s repositioning.

You keep moving.

The intact catwalk runs straight for another ten meters before it doglegs left around a support pier. Your headlamp stays low, beam scraping the grating and the base of the wall-run. The humming line is clearly visible now: a bundled conduit strapped to the concrete with fresh metal bands—newer than anything else here. Every few meters a ceramic standoff insulator keeps it off the wall.

Ahead, you find three things in quick succession:

1) **A ladder up**: bolted rungs disappearing into a ceiling hatch. The hatch is shut, and there’s a **fresh smear of sealant** around its rim—recent, not cracked. Someone has been through and tried to keep it dry.

2) **A painted mark** on the pier at the dogleg: the same stenciled symbol you’ve been seeing—partly scrubbed, then repainted over.

3) **Another snare**: a thin, dark line stretched at ankle height across the catwalk just before the dogleg. It’s not catenary wire this time—looks like braided cord or stripped cable jacket, tied off to the conduit bands on the humming wall-run. If you’d kept your pace, you’d have hit it.

Below you, the pale shape tracks your movement. It stays just under the surface, parallel to the catwalk, and when you reach the dogleg it *bumps* the underside of the grating directly beneath the snare—testing, like it knows where you are.

From behind, the Tidewarden calls again, closer than he should be if he was “backing out.” He’s moved to a new angle. “Engineer! Don’t climb. That hatch is Court-sealed in this sector. You go up there, you’ll have every bailiff in Nine on you.”

The tapping you heard earlier answers from inside the pier at your left—right behind the painted mark—slow and deliberate now, like knuckles on the other side of a door.

#### Turn 34 **[PLAYER]**

I crouch and step over the ankle snare without touching the humming conduit, then grab the ladder and start climbing. “Court can bill me—your ‘sealed’ hatch is the only dry exit; cover the catwalk and don’t come closer,” I call back, keeping my headlamp angled down so I can see if anything follows.

*Agent reasoning: Fastest safe path is up the ladder; Court trouble later beats getting dragged into the water now. Snare needs bypass, and the tapping-mark pier might be a side threat—ignore unless it blocks me.*

#### Turn 35 **[GAME]**

You step over the ankle snare cleanly, careful not to brush the humming wall-run. The cord trembles faintly anyway—your pant leg’s wake of air is enough to make it quiver—then settles.

You grab the ladder rungs. Cold metal, slick with condensation. You start climbing.

Two rungs up, the hum changes pitch—subtle, like a transformer taking load. The conduit bands along the wall-run shiver, and the ceramic standoffs give a tiny *tick… tick…* as they flex. Whatever this line is feeding, it just noticed you.

Below, your headlamp angled down catches movement: the pale shape in the water slides to the base of the ladder well and rises until it presses against the underside of the catwalk. You see a long, smooth back break the surface for a second—no eyes, no clear mouth—just a wet ridge and a sudden *thump* as it rams the grating once, hard, directly under your feet.

The ladder vibrates. You keep climbing.

Behind you, the Tidewarden ignores your order. You hear him advance at a jog, then stop short of the snare. “Mara—don’t—” he starts, then cuts himself off as the water below the catwalk surges. He raises something—your lamp catches a brief flash of metal and a loop of line. A spear-gun or a harpoon rig.

He shouts, not at you now but at the water: “HEY! OFF!”

At the dogleg pier, right beside the painted mark, the tapping becomes a sharp, fast *RAP-RAP-RAP* from inside the concrete. Then a new sound: the grind of something turning—like a cam or latch.

You reach the hatch. There’s no wheel, no handle—just a recessed pull and a seam packed with fresh sealant. You hook your fingers into the recess and pull.

It doesn’t open.

The seam *gives* slightly, stretching the sealant like taffy, and you feel the hatch shift maybe a millimeter—then stop against a hard catch. Locked from the other side.

Below, the pale thing hits the catwalk again—twice—trying to deform the grating under the ladder. The Tidewarden fires: a compressed *THUNK* and a line snaps out, striking the water with a splash. The creature rolls away from the impact, but it doesn’t flee; it circles back under the ladder’s shadow.

From inside the pier, the grinding stops. A thin, vertical crack appears in a maintenance panel you hadn’t noticed—right at shoulder height on the pier—and a sliver of dry air leaks out, carrying the clean, sharp smell of ozone and warm dust. Someone is opening something *in the wall* near the painted mark.

#### Turn 36 **[PLAYER]**

I drop back down fast, land light on the catwalk, and move straight for the cracked maintenance panel by the painted mark. “Tidewarden—keep it off the ladder, I’m taking the wall,” I snap, then jam my fingers into the crack and yank the panel open.

*Agent reasoning: Hatch is a dead end and the catwalk’s getting hammered; the wall panel opening is the only fast “dry” route. I need to get off the ladder before the grating deforms and drops me.*

#### Turn 37 **[GAME]**



#### Turn 38 **[PLAYER]**

I drop down the ladder two rungs at a time, hit the catwalk in a crouch, and beeline to the cracked panel by the painted mark. “Tidewarden—keep it off the ladder, I’m taking the wall,” I bark, then jam my fingers into the seam and wrench the maintenance panel open.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is locked and the wall panel is actively opening—fastest path forward is through that access before it closes, while the Tidewarden distracts the water-thing.*

#### Turn 39 **[GAME]**



*Simulation triggers: guard_Crouch_0_8f1d4d*

#### Turn 40 **[PLAYER]**

I drop down the ladder two rungs at a time, hit the catwalk in a crouch, and sprint to the cracked maintenance panel by the painted mark. “Tidewarden—keep it off the ladder, I’m taking the wall,” I bark, then jam my burned hand into the seam and wrench the panel open.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is locked; the cracked panel is the only opening and it’s already being unlatched from inside. Move fast before the water-thing or the Tidewarden complicates it.*

#### Turn 41 **[GAME]**

You come down the ladder hard—two rungs at a time—boots slapping wet metal. The catwalk flexes under your landing.

The pale thing takes that moment. It surges up under the grating and *slams* the underside right where you touch down. The jolt shoots up your shins and nearly pitches you forward, but you catch yourself in a crouch and drive into a sprint.

“Keep it off the ladder,” you snap.

The Tidewarden doesn’t answer with words—he plants his feet wide, braces his harpoon rig against the ladder frame, and yanks the line tight like he’s trying to turn the whole ladder into a barrier. “MOVE!” he barks, voice cracking with effort.

You reach the cracked maintenance panel by the painted mark. Up close it’s not a normal access door—its screws are new, mismatched, and the seam has been cut and re-sealed. The ozone smell is stronger here.

You jam your burned hand into the seam.

The sealant tears with a wet *rip*—and pain knifes up your wrist as the softened skin catches on a sharp, freshly-ground edge. You wrench anyway. The panel pops outward an inch, then fights you on a hidden tether.

Inside is a narrow service void, dry and dusted with concrete flour. A bundle of newer cable—black jacket, clean—runs into a small relay cradle bolted to the inner wall. There’s a faint green indicator LED glowing steady.

And there’s a second thing in there: a trip-strip—thin spring steel—set across the opening at finger height. When you yank the panel wider, it snaps free with a *ping*.

Immediately, somewhere above and behind the pier, you hear a relay *clack* answer it.

The hum in the wall-run rises a notch, and the painted mark beside you—half-scrubbed—shows a fresh edge where something has recently been traced over.

The Tidewarden’s line jerks violently. The pale thing hits again, not the ladder this time—the catwalk stanchion. The whole section shudders, and rusty flakes rain down into the black water.

From the service void, a thin speaker you didn’t see at first emits a dry burst of static, then a human voice—close, controlled, and very calm:

“Hands out of the cradle, Mara Kestrel.”

No one is visible in the void. The voice is coming from the little box itself.

*Simulation triggers: guard_Crouch_0_8f1d4d*

#### Turn 42 **[PLAYER]**

I jerk my burned hand back and spit, “Yeah? Then open something useful.”  
I lean in just enough to sweep my lamp into the service void for a latch/handle or crawlspace continuation, then shout to the Tidewarden, “Catwalk’s coming apart—fallback to the dogleg and keep that thing busy!”

*Agent reasoning: Voice means surveillance and a triggered alarm; best move is grab the quickest exit and avoid touching the relay. The creature is destabilizing the catwalk, so I need a dry route now—either the void is a passage or it’s a trap. Quick check, then commit.*

#### Turn 43 **[GAME]**

You yank your burned hand back; a thin ribbon of skin stays on the fresh metal edge and the sting turns hot, immediate. Your spit hits the catwalk and skitters toward a drain hole.

“Yeah? Then open something useful.”

For a beat there’s only the wall-hum and the Tidewarden’s strained breathing—then the voice in the box answers, still calm. “Useful is relative. Don’t touch the load path.”

You lean in just enough to sweep your lamp into the service void.

The beam shows a crawlspace continuation—tight, rectangular, maybe shoulder-width—running left for a few meters before it kinks downward. There’s a proper handhold rail riveted along the inner lip, and a quick-release latch on a second inner panel… but it’s been wired shut with fresh catenary tie and a wax seal stamped with the upland substation sigil. Whoever did this expected someone like you to look.

Your lamp also catches the relay cradle: ceramic standoffs, a neat coil of new wire, and a small microphone puck. That green LED is steady, not blinking—live and listening.

You shout to the Tidewarden to fall back to the dogleg.

He tries. He unhooks the harpoon rig from the ladder frame and starts shuffling backward along the catwalk, line still tight. “Dogleg—NOW!” he yells, but the movement gives the thing in the water slack.

It uses it.

A pale arm—too long, jointed wrong—hooks up through the grating at the stanchion he just left. Fingers like wet cable ties clamp around the vertical support and *pull*. The stanchion buckles with a metallic groan. The catwalk section between you and the dogleg dips a full handspan, bolts popping one after another like knuckles.

The Tidewarden stumbles, catches the rail, and drags himself onto the more stable dogleg platform, but the harpoon line whips loose and slaps the water—no longer keeping the thing off the ladder or anything else.

The voice in the wall speaks again, closer in your ear through the tiny speaker: “If that span drops, you don’t get a second chance. Get into the void, Mara. Or step away and lose it.”

The catwalk under you is still holding—barely—but the sag is increasing, and the next stanchion is already creaking.

*Simulation triggers: guard_Crouch_0_8f1d4d*

#### Turn 44 **[PLAYER]**

“Fine—your void it is. If you fry me, I haunt your substation.”

I snap the catenary tie and crush the wax seal with my thumb, then shoulder the inner panel hard and dive into the crawlspace, dragging my maps tight to my chest. Over my shoulder, I bark at the Tidewarden, “Stay on the dogleg—don’t follow unless the whole span drops!”

*Agent reasoning: Catwalk is failing; fastest safe path is the crawlspace. The wax seal/wire is a delay—I'll break it and commit, no negotiation.*

#### Turn 45 **[GAME]**

The catenary tie doesn’t “snap” so much as *fight*—it’s fresh, braided tight. Your burned fingers slip on the plastic jacket once, then you get leverage and tear it apart with a sharp *crack* that echoes in the void.

You grind your thumb into the wax seal. It breaks in gritty chunks, the stamped sigil splitting cleanly down the middle.

The moment the seal breaks, the green LED on the relay cradle flickers—steady to blinking—like it just acknowledged a state change.

“Fine—your void it is. If you fry me, I haunt your substation.”

From the speaker: a quiet exhale, then, “Don’t be dramatic. Go.”

You shoulder the inner panel. It gives way with a metallic bark and a burst of dry dust. You dive into the crawlspace, maps pressed to your chest. The edges scrape concrete; the space is tight enough that your packless shoulders still wedge. Your lamp beam stutters as it bumps the wall, then steadies, painting the crawlspace in a harsh cone.

Behind you, the catwalk span finally lets go—*not* the whole thing, but a section. A row of bolts shears and the grating drops with a shriek, slamming into the water and throwing up a cold spray that hits your boots and calves as you pull in. The sound is immediate: water slapping through the new hole, metal chattering against metal.

The Tidewarden, on the dogleg, does exactly what you told him—he doesn’t follow. He backs farther onto the platform, raises his lamp, and shouts over the noise, “Kestrel! I’m holding here!”

Something pale surges beneath the fallen grating and *rakes* at it from below. The metal flexes and clatters like teeth.

Inside the crawlspace, the air is dry but sharp with ozone. A thin cable runs along the right wall into the kink ahead. As you wriggle forward, your lamp catches fresh chalk hash-marks on the concrete—recent, neat, technician-straight.

From the speaker behind you, now muffled by the panel and distance: “Don’t turn around. Keep moving. There’s a drop in three meters—feet first. If you go headfirst, you’ll break your neck.”

No shocks hit you. But the blinking LED and that relay clack you heard earlier make it clear: someone just got notified you broke their seal.

*Simulation triggers: guard_Crouch_0_8f1d4d, watcher_Crouch_0_b73e4b*

#### Turn 46 **[PLAYER]**

I grit my teeth and shove forward along the right-wall cable, counting off the three meters under my breath. “Tidewarden—hold position and stay loud. If you go quiet, I’m assuming you’re dead.”  
At the drop, I swing my legs around, go feet-first, and ease down fast—lamp angled to catch the landing and any side access before I commit my weight.

*Agent reasoning: The catwalk is failing and the pale thing is active; the fastest safe path is deeper into the crawlspace. I’ll take the voice’s warning but stay wary, and I need to keep the Tidewarden from doing something dumb.*

#### Turn 47 **[GAME]**

You follow the right-wall cable on elbows and knees, concrete biting through your trousers. At “three,” the crawlspace kinks down exactly as warned.

“Tidewarden—hold position and stay loud. If you go quiet, I’m assuming you’re dead.”

From behind, his voice carries through the panel and the dropped grating noise: “Still here! Still loud! You hear me, Kestrel?” He bangs something metal-on-metal twice—deliberate, a signal you can track through the structure.

You pivot in the tight space, swing your legs around, and feed them into the drop feet-first. Your lamp is angled down; the beam finds the landing before your soles do.

It’s a vertical service shaft, about two meters down. Dry. The floor is a grated platform over a deeper void, with a narrow ledge of poured concrete on the left wall—enough to stand on if you keep your weight close. The cable you’ve been following continues down through a conduit throat and disappears below the grating.

You ease down fast. Your boots touch the grating and it flexes—old steel, but not failing. When you shift your weight onto it, it holds.

Your lamp catches two important details immediately:

1) **Side access**: on the left wall, shoulder height, there’s a rectangular hatch with a recessed handle. It’s been opened recently—scrape marks around the handle, and the hinge pins are shiny.

2) **A threat**: on the far side of the shaft, opposite the hatch, there’s a small motion sensor puck and a pinhole camera set into a newer plate. A red indicator blinks once as your light sweeps it, then goes steady.

The calm voice comes again, now clearer, as if the speaker is in this shaft too: “Good. Stay off the center of the grate. Third bar from the left is cracked.”

As if to underline it, something below the grating **hits the underside**—not the pale thing from the water (this is dry), but a heavy, rhythmic *thunk* from deeper in the shaft. Dust puffs up through the grate. The impact is patient, repeated, like someone testing the same spot.

From behind you—muffled and more distant now—the Tidewarden is still making noise, but his banging has changed pace: faster, panicked. “Kestrel—IT’S CLIMBING—” His words cut off into a wet scramble and a sharp metallic crash.

Then he’s loud again, forced loud: “Still here! Still loud!” It sounds like he’s lying to keep you moving.

#### Turn 48 **[PLAYER]**

I flatten onto the left concrete ledge, keeping my weight off the center bars, and slide to the hatch. “Tidewarden, two bangs if you’re upright—three if you’re bleeding,” I shout, then yank the recessed handle and slip through fast, angling my lamp down to avoid lighting the camera.

*Agent reasoning: Tidewarden’s in trouble and the shaft has surveillance; fastest progress is through the side hatch while staying off the cracked grate and avoiding the camera’s view.*

#### Turn 49 **[GAME]**

You plaster yourself to the left ledge and crab along it. The concrete is slick with old mineral bloom but solid; your boots find narrow purchase. The grate booms again under the next *thunk* from below, but you’re not on it—only your lamp beam trembles.

“Tidewarden, two bangs if you’re upright—three if you’re bleeding!”

There’s a pause, then **three** hard, uneven bangs answer back through the structure—one of them muffled, like his arm slipped. He shouts, voice ragged: “Bleeding. Still up. Don’t—don’t come back.”

You hook fingers into the recessed handle. It’s stiff—vacuum-tight—then gives with a wet pop as the seal breaks. You pull the hatch outward just enough to get a shoulder through.

Angling your lamp down helps, but the camera isn’t fooled by brightness alone. As you cross the threshold, the red indicator on the newer plate flips from steady to a rapid blink. Somewhere close, a relay clicks twice—confirmation, like a sent message.

You slip through fast.

On the other side is a narrow maintenance corridor, dry and warmer by a degree. The walls are old tile over concrete, but the cable runs are new: bundled, zip-tied, tagged with printed labels. Your lamp aimed low catches **bootscuffs and drag marks** leading away to the right, and a fresh smear of grease at knee height where someone crawled recently.

The hatch starts to swing shut behind you on a spring hinge. You can stop it, but if you let it close it will latch automatically.

From the speaker—now definitely in this corridor, not the shaft—the calm voice says, quieter: “Good. Keep the light down. They’ll have your faceprint in ten seconds.”

Behind the hatch, the rhythmic *thunk* below the grate changes—faster now, closer together—like whatever is down there has noticed movement above and is trying to time the structure.

And from the far right of your new corridor, beyond your lamp’s pool, something answers the relay clicks: a soft, human cough—then the scrape of a shoe adjusting stance, someone trying not to be heard but failing.

#### Turn 50 **[PLAYER]**

I let the hatch swing shut and latch, then drop low against the left wall by the hinge, lamp hooded to a slit. “You—on the speaker. Give me the fastest path to an exit that doesn’t go past the cough.”

*Agent reasoning: Hatch latching buys time and blocks whatever’s thumping below; the watcher right is immediate threat, so I’ll close the hatch and move to cover while forcing the voice to give me a direct route past the human.*

#### Turn 51 **[GAME]**

The hatch swings shut with a soft *clack* as the latch catches. The corridor noise changes immediately—more muffled, the deeper *thunk* from the shaft now a felt vibration through the wall instead of a boom.

You drop low by the hinge, left shoulder into tile, lamp reduced to a thin slit aimed at the floor. From here you can see under the corridor’s right-side shadow: the base of conduit racks, a thin line of damp dust, and the drag marks curving right.

The speaker answers without delay, voice close enough you feel it in the wall: “Fastest exit that avoids the right bend is behind you—service return. But it’s not an exit. It’s a loop to the valve gallery.”

You hear a quick *tap-tap* from somewhere ahead—like a knuckle on tile—then a whisper, not from the speaker, from the darkness to the right: “Mara?”

The cough wasn’t accidental. Whoever’s there knows your name.

The speaker continues, lower: “There’s a left crawl thirty paces ahead, opposite the right bend. You can reach it without showing your face if you stay low and keep the light down. It drops into a cable trench that runs to the old tramline junction. That junction is watched.”

A new sound joins in: a faint electronic chirp, once, from the camera plate back in the shaft—audible even through the hatch. Then another, as if it’s handshaking with something. You get the sense your presence just propagated outward.

From the right-hand darkness, the unseen person shifts again—shoe rubber squeaks on tile. A small beam of light, tighter than yours, flicks on for half a second and cuts off, like they’re signaling or checking distance without committing.

They whisper again, closer than before: “Don’t run. Just talk.”

The threat is clear now: one human ahead on the right with at least a small light, and your position has likely been logged by the corridor’s newer surveillance. The left crawl the speaker mentioned exists, but reaching it means moving into the open stretch where the watcher can close distance or call others.

*Simulation triggers: guard_Crouch_0_8f1d4d, watcher_Crouch_0_b73e4b*

#### Turn 52 **[PLAYER]**

Keeping low, I slide forward along the left wall toward the left crawl, lamp still hooded. “Not running—routing,” I call back flatly. “Say your name and what you want, or stay in the dark.”

*Agent reasoning: The watcher knows my name and wants me to “talk”—stall tactic or ambush. Fastest safe move is the left crawl; I’ll move low, keep them unsure, and avoid giving my face to cameras or their light.*

#### Turn 53 **[GAME]**

You slide forward, shoulder and hip scraping tile, keeping your silhouette low. The hooded slit of light tracks the base of the wall: dust, cable ties, a junction box with a new printed label—**“RACK 3 / FEED A”**—and then, ahead, the corridor opens into the decision point the speaker mentioned.

On your left: a **low rectangular crawl** cut into the wall, its edge ringed with fresh sealant like someone’s been in and out. The opening is just big enough for a body and a pack—if you had one. A faint draft spills out, warmer and drier than the corridor air.

On your right: the corridor bends away into darker space.

“Not running—routing,” you call, voice flat. “Say your name and what you want, or stay in the dark.”

The person on the right answers immediately, and it’s a woman’s voice—thin, controlled, trying to sound casual and failing at it. “Sable. Choir.” A pause. “I want the ceramic. And I want you alive.”

As she says it, she does something practical: a small object skitters across the tile from the right bend into the open stretch—**a palm-sized puck** that lands near the centerline and emits a soft, rising whine. Your lamp slit catches it just enough to see a blinking LED.

A heartbeat later, your eyes sting and your throat tightens—**irritant**, fine and dry, not smoke. It’s meant to flush you out of the low line and make you cough loud enough to pinpoint.

Sable stays behind the corner; you don’t see her, but you hear her shift and the quiet click of something being readied—metal on plastic, like a compact launcher or a tool being unfolded.

The speaker in the wall cuts in, sharp for the first time: “IN. NOW.”

Behind you, through tile and latch, the shaft transmits a faster sequence of impacts—*thunk-thunk-thunk*—as if whatever’s below has found a rhythm and is climbing or striking supports in a pattern. The corridor vibrates lightly with each hit.

You are at the left crawl entrance, low and close. The irritant is already in the air and thickening around the floor level where you’re breathing. Sable is armed around the right bend, and she’s trying to force you to either cough, stand, or retreat.

*Simulation triggers: guard_Crouch_0_8f1d4d, watcher_Crouch_0_b73e4b*

#### Turn 54 **[PLAYER]**

I suck a shallow breath through my sleeve, clamp my mouth shut, and snake into the left crawl fast—kicking the irritant puck back toward the right bend as I go. “Keep wanting me alive, Sable—don’t follow blind.”

*Agent reasoning: Irritant will pin me and Sable has the angle; fastest is commit to the left crawl immediately, keep low, and avoid coughing. Seal her line of sight and force a chase on my terms.*

#### Turn 55 **[GAME]**

You pull your sleeve over nose and mouth, take one tight sip of air, and commit. Your shoulders wedge the crawl’s lip; fresh sealant smears your shirt as you wriggle in.

Your heel catches the puck on the way—solid contact. It skates back across the tile, spinning, LED strobing as it bounces once and slides toward the right bend.

It works: the puck disappears around the corner and the whine spikes, now clearly coming from Sable’s side. A half-second later she coughs—one sharp, involuntary bark—and you hear her stumble back a step.

But the irritant you already stirred up doesn’t vanish. The crawl is narrower than the corridor, and the air in here is **stale**. Your sleeve helps, but your eyes water hard and your chest wants to seize into a cough you’re fighting by will alone.

Behind you, Sable snaps, voice harsher now: “—Fine. Fine! Don’t—” Another cough, then a clipped command to someone else you can’t see: “Mask up!”

So she’s not alone, or she’s calling backup.

Then the sound you were warned about: a compact *thup*—not a gunshot, more like a spring-propelled tool. Something strikes the crawl entrance with a metallic *clink* and scrapes, as if she’s fired or tossed a **hooked probe** to snag cables or drag you back.

It doesn’t catch you—your legs are already past the lip—but it **bites into the crawl edge** and holds. The line attached to it goes taut.

Sable, still around the bend, calls after you between breaths: “Mara! I can pull you out of there, or I can pull the whole mouth down. Your choice.”

Ahead, the crawl drops a few inches into a cable trench—dark, tight, and running forward. Your lamp slit shows bundled wire and a shallow channel you can belly-slide along. You can keep moving deeper, but there’s now a tether anchored at the entrance that can be used to haul, block, or collapse the opening if she’s telling the truth.

The banging from the shaft continues behind the latched hatch—fast and regular—close enough that the tile under your ribs trembles.

*Simulation triggers: guard_Crouch_0_8f1d4d, watcher_Crouch_0_b73e4b*

#### Turn 56 **[PLAYER]**

I wrench my leg back and stomp the line into the cable bundle, twisting to snag it, then scrape it hard against the crawl lip to fray or jam the hook. “Pull it and you’ll bring the ceiling on your own head,” I rasp, and then I belly-slide deeper down the trench, lamp slit kept low and forward.

*Agent reasoning: Speed says don’t negotiate—break the tether and keep moving before backup arrives; use environment (cables/edge) to foul the line.*

#### Turn 57 **[GAME]**

Your boot finds the line where it crosses the crawl mouth. You stomp it down into the cable bundle and twist—hard. The sheath bites into old insulation; copper strands underneath the bundle *ping* as they shift. Then you drag the line against the crawl lip where the sealant is still tacky.

It doesn’t cleanly fray, but it **jams**. The hook at the entrance scrapes and chatters as you torque the line sideways; you hear the metal point grind against the concrete edge.

Sable tests it with a sharp tug.

The line goes taut, then **sticks**. Instead of you sliding back, the tension transfers to the crawl mouth: you hear a brittle *crack* from the lip—old concrete spalling—followed by a sprinkle of grit and a couple of pebble-sized chunks bouncing into the trench beside your ribs.

Your threat lands. Sable stops pulling.

“—Shit,” she hisses, voice closer now, like she’s crouched at the bend listening. “Don’t move. Don’t move—”

A second voice answers her, muffled like it’s behind a respirator: “You want me to cut it?”

Sable: “No. If we cut it, she keeps the hook.”

Then: the distinct sound of a **blade on line** anyway—someone’s sawing carefully, not to free you, but to free *their* tool without yanking the mouth down. The line vibrates against the cable bundle under your boot.

You belly-slide deeper. The trench narrows and angles slightly downward. Your lamp slit catches a run of cable tags—old municipal—then a newer painted mark: that same **stenciled symbol** you saw on the hatch, repeated small on the trench wall as if guiding someone who knows it.

Behind you, the sawing continues for two seconds… then stops. A soft *snap* follows—not a clean cut. The line breaks under tension.

The hook stays **in the crawl lip**. The loose end of line whips back toward them out in the corridor.

Sable’s voice follows you, sharper and no longer pretending calm: “She’s in the trench! She’s heading tramline-side—call it in!”

You gain distance, but you’ve left a metal hook embedded at the mouth like a marker, and you’ve just confirmed your route to at least two Choir operatives. The irritant is weaker down here, but your eyes still burn and your chest is tight; any hard exertion risks a cough that carries in the confined trench.

#### Turn 58 **[PLAYER]**

I kill the lamp for three seconds, count the seconds between their voices, then relight to a slit and take the first side splice/handhole I can find, even if it’s tight. As I pass, I yank a loose cable loop and kick grit into the trench behind me to foul crawling and hide my track, then keep sliding fast and silent.

*Agent reasoning: They’re calling in my route; speed matters. I need to break line-of-pursuit and avoid coughing—ditch the marked path by taking the first junction/maintenance splice and create a simple obstruction behind me.*

#### Turn 60 **[PLAYER]**

I keep the lamp to a slit and push deeper until I hit a marked handhole or splice box, then peel into it and pull the cover back into place behind me. I listen for pursuit—how many sets of scrapes, how fast—then move toward the tramline junction only if it stays quiet.

*Agent reasoning: Blank prompt means no new scene; I’ll force forward progress—get out of the trench to a junction and away from the Choir’s line-of-travel.*

#### Turn 61 **[GAME]**

You keep the lamp down to a thin slit and shove forward on forearms and hips, cable insulation slick under your sleeves. The trench runs another ten meters before the wall widens into a rectangular recess: a handhole with a cast cover half-buried in silt. On its rim, under grime, the same stenciled mark repeats—fresh enough to still look black, not algae-bloomed.

You hook your fingers under the cover edge and lever. It gives with a wet pop. The opening is barely shoulder-wide, but it’s there. You peel in sideways, ribs scraping concrete, and pull the cover back into place from inside until it settles with a dull *thunk*. From the trench side it looks closed again—just another dirty lid.

You go still and listen.

At first: nothing but your own breathing and the faint far-off banging through structure.

Then, from back the way you came: **two** distinct sets of contact sounds—one heavier, one lighter—scraping and bumping along the trench. They’re not belly-sliding as cleanly as you did; you hear cable ties snap and grit dragged, and once, a muffled curse.

Sable’s voice carries down the trench, closer now, controlled again: “Easy. Don’t pull on anything—there’s a drop somewhere.”

The second voice, still respirator-muffled: “Hook’s gone. Line’s gone. She’s ahead.”

They stop near where your handhole is—close enough that the cover above you ticks as grit shifts under someone’s weight. A flashlight beam knifes past the lid’s seam in a thin, accidental line, then moves on. The heavier one taps the trench wall with something metal—*tink… tink…*—testing for hollows.

Sable, right over you or just past: “She knows these. Check lids.”

A hand scrapes across the cover’s edge. The lid shifts a hair—enough to sprinkle dust into your hair—but it doesn’t lift. After a second, the hand moves away.

They continue forward, past you, their scrapes receding toward tramline-side.

You wait them out. When their sounds thin and the trench goes quiet again, you ease the cover up a finger-width and look through the seam: empty trench, their light now a distant smear.

Moving toward the tramline junction is possible now, but you’ve learned two things: they’re willing to crawl the trench after you, and they’re actively checking for hides—if they loop back, this handhole won’t stay safe twice.

#### Turn 62 **[PLAYER]**

I ease the cover up just enough to slip out, then seal it back down without a clack. Lamp stays slit-tight as I belly-slide the way they came—fast, aiming to pop out at the crawl mouth/corridor behind them and break for the tramline junction before they double back.

*Agent reasoning: They passed me and will check back; best move is to slip behind them and take the junction before they realize. Minimal noise, quick transition back into the trench and reverse direction.*

#### Turn 63 **[GAME]**

You ease the cover up a finger-width, then two, and slide out like you’re being born back into the trench. You settle the lid down from the outside with your palm flat, letting it sink into silt instead of clacking on concrete. It lands with a soft, gritty *shff*—quiet enough.

Lamp stays a slit. You reverse direction and drive yourself forward, fast. Your earlier grit-kick and cable yank did what you wanted: the trench behind you is rougher now, and you can feel it—snag points, loose loops, places to catch a knee. You power through them anyway.

Halfway back, you hear it: a new sound layered over the distant banging—water moving where it shouldn’t. Not a wave, not drip. A thin, steady *glug-glug* like a siphon catching.

Then the trench floor gives a little under your weight—silt liquefying. Your forearm plunges to the elbow into cold slurry and you have to wrench it free. The lamp slit wobbles; your beam catches a hairline seam in the trench wall where the newer sealant is peeling.

You keep going.

At the crawl mouth, the embedded hook is still there, canted at an angle like a thorn. You ease past it and push your head out into the corridor—

—and immediately see light on the wet concrete: a flashlight beam sweeping back toward you. They’ve turned around sooner than you counted on.

Sable is ten meters down-corridor, crouched, looking into the trench line you’re emerging from. The respirator-muffled one stands behind her with a short pry bar in hand. They’re not running; they’re hunting.

Sable’s eyes catch the glint off your lamp slit for a fraction of a second.

“There,” she says, flat and certain.

The respirator voice barks, “Block her—”

Sable surges toward you, not to tackle, but to **slam the crawl mouth** with her boot and body weight. The corridor is narrow; if she gets her foot on the lip, you’re pinned half-in, half-out.

At the same moment, the *glug* behind you becomes a sudden *rush*—the trench you just belly-slid through starts taking water, fast, as if a valve or pocket gave way. Cold water pushes at your legs from inside the crawl, trying to shove you out into the corridor… or trap you if the mouth gets blocked.

You have a heartbeat of advantage: you’re already at the lip, shoulders out. But Sable is closing, and the trench is actively flooding behind you.

*Simulation triggers: guard_Crouch_0_8f1d4d, watcher_Crouch_0_b73e4b*

#### Turn 64 **[PLAYER]**

I lunge fully out, twisting hard to clear my hips, and as Sable closes I kick the embedded hook/lip sideways at ankle height to catch her step. “Bad timing—your trench is flooding,” I rasp, then break into a dead sprint toward the tramline junction, lamp still a slit and kept low.

*Agent reasoning: I can’t get pinned in the mouth with water rising; fastest is commit out, use the hook/lip as a trip point, then sprint for the tramline junction before they can reset.*

#### Turn 65 **[GAME]**

You wrench your hips free and spill onto the corridor floor just as the trench behind you surges—cold water slapping your boots from the crawl mouth.

Sable commits to the block anyway. You snap your foot sideways at ankle height, catching the embedded hook/lip and levering it out just enough that it bites where her step wants to land.

Her boot comes down—then skates as the hook shifts. Her ankle rolls. She goes down hard on one knee with a sharp, involuntary grunt, palms slapping the wet concrete.

“Bad timing—your trench is flooding,” you rasp as you’re already turning.

The respirator-muffled one reacts instantly: he doesn’t stop to help her. He lunges past, pry bar up like a baton, trying to cut the corridor angle and tag you as you accelerate. The bar whistles and *clangs* off the wall a handspan from your shoulder as you duck your lamp and drive forward.

Behind you, Sable snarls through pain, “Don’t—let—her—” then she sucks a breath and shouts, louder, “Mark her route! Don’t chase blind!”

The flooding trench makes its own announcement: a rising, hollow roar as water fills the cable run and burps air back out of the crawl mouth. It’s loud enough to smear your footfalls for a moment—good cover—but it also means that crawl is about to become a sluice, and anything connected to it may start taking water.

You sprint toward the tramline junction. The corridor bends past a set of blistered signage plates. Your slit beam catches fresh wet scuffs—boot traffic recent—leading the same way. Not just theirs.

At the bend, the air changes: cooler, more open. The tramline junction is close.

Behind you, the respirator runner is still coming, lighter on his feet than you expected. You hear his breath hiss and the slap of rubber soles gaining, and Sable—still back at the crawl mouth—yells something you can’t fully make out over the water, but you catch the last word: “—junction!”

They’re not only chasing. They’re calling ahead.

*Simulation triggers: guard_Crouch_0_8f1d4d, watcher_Crouch_0_b73e4b*

#### Turn 66 **[PLAYER]**

I kill the lamp for two strides, then cut hard to the wall and feel for any service ladder/utility alcove before the junction mouth; if I find one, I drop into it to bypass the open junction. If not, I grab whatever loose signage/pipe bracket I can and rip it down behind me as I run to make the corridor a mess, then hiss, “Wrong way,” and peel into the first side access marked for maintenance instead of the main tramline.

*Agent reasoning: They’re calling ahead, so the junction is about to get boxed. Fastest play is to avoid the main opening, use infrastructure to change levels, and buy seconds by creating noise/obstacles behind me.*

#### Turn 67 **[GAME]**

You kill the lamp and take two blind strides. Your shoulder kisses the wall; your fingers skate over blistered paint and wet concrete until they find a vertical seam—an inset frame. You keep moving by touch, feeling for ladder rungs or a latch.

Your hand hits cold metal: a recessed pull ring. You yank.

Nothing—then it gives a centimeter with a gritty squeal you can’t fully smother. The panel is heavier than it should be, and it’s stuck on swollen guides. You brace and haul again. It opens enough to slip your head and one shoulder into a narrow utility alcove: a service drop with a ladder down into black.

You don’t climb so much as fall onto the first rungs and slide down fast, palms burning. Above, you drag the panel toward closed; it doesn’t seat flush, but it narrows to a finger gap. From the corridor, it’ll look like a misaligned access, not an open hole.

You hear the respirator runner hit the bend and overshoot by momentum—boot slaps, a sharp intake. His light sweeps, catches the skewed edge of the access panel for a blink, then swings away.

He hisses, close, “Kestrel! Junction’s ahead—don’t—”

Sable’s voice, farther back, hard: “She’s not going open. Check the wall. Check the wall!”

The runner doubles back two steps. His beam crawls along the concrete and lands on the panel gap. He steps in, pry bar tapping once—*tink*—right above your head through the metal.

You freeze on the ladder, one rung down from the alcove floor, the shaft air damp and cold. Below you, water is moving—quiet but present—lapping against something metal, like a flooded landing. The same siphon-glug you heard in the trench is down here too, faint but steady, as if this drop ties into the run that just started filling.

Above, the runner wedges the pry bar into the panel seam. Metal groans. The gap widens a fraction.

Sable arrives at the bend; you hear her limp in the cadence. “Open it,” she says. “If she went down, she’s boxed. These drops dead-end or flood.”

The pry bar bites again. The panel starts to peel open.

You are in the service drop, on a ladder, with someone about to look straight down—and water rising somewhere underneath.

#### Turn 68 **[PLAYER]**

I kill the lamp and slide down the ladder hard, skipping rungs until I hit the flooded landing with a splash, then move off to the side and yank something metal loose to clatter deeper in the dark. “Yeah—dead end,” I call up, breath tight, then go silent and feel for a low hatch or conduit run out of the landing.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to spot me; fastest is to break line-of-sight and force a choice—either they follow into rising water or lose me. I’ll drop fast, kill the lamp, and make noise deeper to bait them away from the shaft lip.*

#### Turn 69 **[GAME]**

You slide fast—palms stuttering on wet rungs—then drop the last meter and hit the landing with a loud splash. Water comes up to mid-shin, colder than the trench, and it smells like battery acid and rust.

You sidestep into the darkest corner you can find, shoulder to slick brick, and rip at the nearest loose thing: a corroded conduit strap half-hanging from the wall. It tears free with a gritty snap. You fling it out into the dark; it clatters across metal grating and bounces—*clang… clang… clang*—then settles with a final hollow *donk* deeper in the shaft.

“Yeah—dead end,” you call up, breath tight.

For half a second there’s nothing—then the pry bar above stops working the panel.

Sable’s voice carries down, closer now, sharp with certainty: “She’s lying.”

The respirator runner answers, “I heard her—she’s down there.”

“Then don’t look down like an idiot,” Sable snaps. “Drop a light. If she runs, she runs into water.”

A moment later something small scrapes over the lip above, and a light source drops: not a flashlight—too valuable—but a chemical glowstick. It bounces off a rung, hits the water with a *plop*, and floats, casting a sick green wash across the landing.

The glow outlines you didn’t see in the dark: the landing is a grated platform bolted to the wall, with an open rectangular sump cut into it on the far side. Water is actively draining into that sump in a steady whirl, the *glug* you heard now loud and constant. Whatever started siphoning is pulling from here too.

In the green light you feel along the wall: you find a low, square hatch at knee height, its edges sealed long ago—until recently. Fresh gray sealant has been cut and peeled back in a rough crescent, leaving a gap you can get fingers into. The hatch is warm compared to the water, like there’s air moving behind it.

Above you, boots scrape; someone starts down the ladder. The rungs creak in a steady rhythm—controlled descent, one hand free.

Sable stays up top, voice angled down: “Don’t go far. She wants you close.”

The immediate threats are clear: one of them is descending into the shaft toward the landing, and the siphon is pulling water down through the sump hard enough that footing on the grating is getting slicker by the second.

#### Turn 70 **[PLAYER]**

I wrench the low hatch open and shove through immediately, keeping low and using the air flow as my guide; once I’m in, I pull it mostly shut to kill the green glow spill. If the ladder climber hits the landing, I kick water toward the sump to mask my sound, then move fast along the conduit run without the lamp.

*Agent reasoning: Fast exit beats hiding; the warm, recently-cut hatch is the only likely route before the climber reaches the landing, and the sump makes this spot a trap.*

#### Turn 71 **[GAME]**

You get your fingers into the cut sealant and heave. The hatch fights—swollen gasket, metal-on-metal—then pops free with a sharp *crack* that echoes off the shaft walls. You shove through immediately, chest and shoulder scraping the frame, and drop into a low service run.

The air is moving in here, steady and warmer, carrying a dry-dust smell and the faint tang of ozone. You stay crouched and pull the hatch mostly shut behind you. The green glow from the shaft collapses to a thin line at the seam, then almost nothing.

Behind the hatch, the ladder climber reaches the landing. You hear his boots splash, then the grate creak as he shifts weight. You sweep your foot through the water on your side of the hatch opening—one hard kick—sending a sheet toward the sump. It answers with a louder *glug* and a brief increase in draining noise, enough to smear the small sounds you make as you move.

The climber mutters, close and muffled through rubber and mask, “Landing. Glow’s here.” His pry bar taps the grate once. “No visual.”

Sable’s voice drops down from above, calmer now: “Check the walls. Feel for warm air. She’ll take a cut.”

The conduit run you’re in is just tall enough to crouch-walk. Bundles of cable are clipped along the right side like ribs; your shoulder brushes them and they tremble faintly. You move fast without the lamp, guided by the airflow and the texture changes under your boots—smooth concrete to rougher aggregate, then a short section of metal plate.

Twenty meters in, the corridor doglegs left. As you round it, the airflow strengthens—and with it comes a new sound: that rhythmic banging, closer than it’s ever been, coming from somewhere ahead and slightly below, like a hammer on a pipe in a flooded void. *Thunk… pause… thunk… pause…*

Behind you, metal groans. The hatch—your hatch—scrapes. The climber has found it and is working it from the other side.

He calls out, low but urgent, “Found a cut hatch. Warm draft.”

Sable answers immediately, “Hold. I’m coming down. Don’t follow her into a box alone.”

The threat is now twofold: the hatch behind you is being opened (they’re about to enter), and ahead in the dark the banging source is close and aligned with your path.

#### Turn 72 **[PLAYER]**

I keep moving, low and fast toward the banging, feeling for a junction box, valve wheel, or any loose cable clamp I can rip free; if I find one, I drag it along the wall to scrape and then toss it back down the corridor to fake my direction. When the banging’s within arm’s reach, I hiss, “You alive?” into the dark without stopping, then angle toward any downward access or side cut the airflow favors.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to breach the hatch; I need distance fast. The banging could be a person or a hazard, but it’s also a landmark—push past it and find an exit or a choke point.*

#### Turn 73 **[GAME]**

You crouch-run the conduit, one hand on the cable ribs, the other probing the wall for anything you can tear free. Your fingers find a junction box—old steel, hinged—half its screws missing. You wrench; it doesn’t come off clean, but the lid tears free with a shriek of metal and a snap of brittle paint.

You drag that lid along the wall as you move—deliberate scrape, long and ugly—then whip it back down the corridor behind you. It skitters on the metal plate section, bouncing hard at the dogleg: *CLANG—clatter—clatter—clatter* fading toward the hatch.

Immediately: voices behind you shift. The climber (now inside the run) calls, “She’s moving—left! Heard it—” His boots slap into a run, chasing the thrown noise.

Sable’s answer is tight and corrective, closer than before: “That’s a throw. Slow down. Read the air—”

You keep going.

The banging is close enough to feel through your knees as vibration in the floor plate: *thunk… thunk…* Regular, patient. You reach a section where the conduit widens into a small service bay with a waist-high rail and a square opening in the floor—an access down. The air is definitely favoring that opening: warmer draft rising, carrying a sharper ozone bite and a whiff of hot insulation.

At the edge of the opening, the source of the banging reveals itself in the faintest ambient bleed from behind you: a vertical pipe disappears into the hole, and something below is striking it with steady force—metal on metal, not random debris. Each hit rings up the pipe like a tuning fork.

You don’t stop. You lean into the dark and hiss, “You alive?”

The banging stops mid-cycle.

A voice answers from below, close enough to be directly under the opening, distorted as if through a mask or a mouthful of water: “Isolator.”

Not a question. A demand.

Then, very softly, another sound: fingers—or something like fingers—scraping the inside of the pipe as if climbing by feel.

From behind you, pursuit noise returns—boots, a hard breath—faster now: the runner has realized the throw too late and is correcting back toward you.

You angle toward the down access with the rising warm air. The opening is just big enough to drop through, but there’s no ladder visible—only the pipe, a slick rim, and darkness that smells like live electrical gear somewhere below.

Threats are now explicit and immediate:
- The runner is closing from behind inside the conduit run.
- Something below the access knows about the isolator and is moving upward toward the opening.

#### Turn 74 **[PLAYER]**

I snap, “Which isolator—color or label?” while I hook my boot on the rail, grab the pipe with both hands, and drop through the opening fast, sliding down the pipe to control the fall; as I go, I kick the rail hard to clang and make it sound like I slipped.

*Agent reasoning: Runner’s closing; dropping is fastest. “Isolator” likely means cut power—might buy safety and bargaining leverage with whatever’s below. I’ll force the pursuer to hesitate by making the drop look lethal and commit to the down route.*

#### Turn 75 **[GAME]**

“Which isolator—color or label?” you snap into the hole as you commit.

Your boot hooks the rail; both hands clamp the pipe. You drop through and let your weight slide, palms burning as the pipe’s cold slime and rust fight your grip. On the way down you kick the rail hard—*KLANG*—a clean, panicked-sounding hit that rings up into the conduit bay.

Above, the runner skids in and swears. “She—she slipped—!” His boots slap the grate; he leans over the opening, glow leaking down in a thin wedge.

The voice below answers immediately, closer now, calm in a way that doesn’t match the banging: “Ceramic. Upland stamp. Don’t play dumb.”

They know exactly what you took.

Your slide buys you distance, but not safety. Ten feet down the pipe, something *hits you*—a hand or tool hooking your ankle. You jerk, lose friction, and drop the last stretch uncontrolled. You slam into shallow water with your side and forearm, hard enough to knock air out of you. The pipe hums above like a struck bell.

You’re in a lower chamber: a dry-ish concrete shelf at the edge, with ankle-deep water beyond and a narrow catwalk running left. The air is warmer here, and there’s a faint blue-white flicker deeper in—arcing or a relay indicator—lighting wet surfaces in pulses.

Right in front of you, half-crouched in the water, is a figure in a patched suit with a scavenged face shield. One gloved hand holds a short striking tool—what they were using to bang the pipe—now lowered. The other hand is extended toward you, palm up.

“Give it,” they say, not raising their voice. “And I’ll tell you which way stays dry.”

Above, the runner’s voice echoes down the pipe: “Mara! Answer me!” Metal scrapes—he’s starting down after you, using the pipe or whatever purchase he can find.

You have two immediate threats in the same space: the unknown below who knows about the upland isolator and is within arm’s reach, and the Tidewarden runner descending toward your position through the pipe you just used.

#### Turn 76 **[PLAYER]**

I slap my wet map case once like I’m checking it, keep the isolator hidden, and bark, “Dry route. Now. I’ll pay when I see it.” Then I grab their extended wrist, shove it down and sideways to off-balance them, and bolt left along the catwalk—low, fast—calling up the pipe, “Keep coming and you’ll eat water, idiot.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m boxed between the runner above and this scav below; fastest exit is to buy two seconds, trade partial truth, then move toward the catwalk before the runner drops in.*

#### Turn 77 **[GAME]**

You slap your map case—hard, loud—like you’re checking it’s still there. The shielded figure’s head tilts toward it instantly. Their gloved hand tightens, not on your arm but on the idea of what you’re carrying.

“Dry route. Now. I’ll pay when I see it,” you bark.

Their palm stays up. “Payment first.”

You take the wrist instead.

Your grip lands on slick glove and taped seam; you shove down and sideways. It works—partially. They stumble a half-step, boot skidding in the ankle-deep water, but they don’t go down. The striking tool flashes up, not swung full-force—just a short, brutal jab aimed at your ribs as you pass.

It clips you on the side: a dull, compressing hit that steals a slice of breath and leaves a hot ache spreading under your arm.

You bolt left onto the catwalk, low and fast. The catwalk is narrow—rebar rail on one side, open water on the other—and it vibrates under your steps. Ahead, the blue-white flicker resolves into a relay cradle mounted on a concrete plinth: ceramic standoffs, fresh-looking cable ties, and a small indicator lamp blinking in a steady, unnatural rhythm.

Behind you, the shielded figure splashes up onto the catwalk after you, moving with practiced balance. “She’s got it!” they call—not to you. Up the pipe. “She’s running left!”

You shout up the pipe, “Keep coming and you’ll eat water, idiot.”

Above, the Tidewarden runner answers with a laugh that’s too thin. “I can swim.”

Then metal shrieks—he’s sliding faster than he should, using the pipe like a fireman’s pole. You hear the scrape and the accelerating rattle; he’s committing to the drop.

The immediate threats are now clear:
- The shielded figure is in pursuit on the catwalk, armed with the short striking tool and calling your direction.
- The Tidewarden runner is about to land in the lower chamber behind you, cutting off retreat and forcing a close chase along the catwalk toward the live relay gear.

No new items change hands; the isolator remains hidden.

#### Turn 78 **[PLAYER]**

I skid in at the relay plinth, rip free a handful of the “fresh” cable ties/cables to make a nasty snag across the catwalk, then shoulder past the plinth and drop low on the far side to use it as cover. “Dry route, now—door, ladder, anything—talk!” I snap over my shoulder at the shielded figure while listening for where the runner lands.

*Agent reasoning: Two hostiles converging; fastest is to weaponize the live relay area to slow pursuit and force separation, then take the driest-looking exit.*

#### Turn 80 **[PLAYER]**

I yank loose a fistful of the fresh cable ties and any slack lead I can grab, string it waist-high across the catwalk as a quick snag, then drop low behind the relay plinth for cover. “Dry route—door, ladder, anything—talk,” I bark at the shielded figure, and I listen hard for the runner’s splash/impact to judge how close he is.

*Agent reasoning: Blank screen means the engine’s waiting; I’ll restate a fast, safe action—set a snag, take cover, force directions, track the runner’s landing.*

#### Turn 81 **[GAME]**

You hit the relay plinth and grab at the “fresh” work first—white cable ties and a loop of slack lead dressed too neatly to be old salvage. The ties tear free with sharp snaps; the slack lead fights you, then gives with a gritty scrape where it was cinched to a bracket.

The moment you disturb it, the indicator lamp on the cradle stutters—blink, blink—then goes steady for a full second. A faint buzz rises in the metal under your hand like a throat clearing.

You string the lead and ties waist-high across the catwalk in a fast, ugly line—more snag than barrier—then drop low behind the concrete plinth. From there you can see the catwalk’s approach and the waterline, but your legs are tight to the edge; one bad shove and you’re in.

The shielded figure charges the last few steps and hits your snag. It catches them across the hips; they pitch forward, arms windmilling. They don’t go over— they slam a palm onto the rebar rail, tool clattering once against metal, and hang there for a heartbeat before they wrench free, ripping the line loose with them.

They crouch, breathing hard, then point the striking tool at the relay cradle like a threat. “You don’t touch that,” they hiss. “You don’t—”

You bark, “Dry route—door, ladder, anything—talk.”

They glance past you, up toward the pipe. Their voice drops, urgent now. “Left end. Service hatch. Yellow wheel. But it’s *keyed*—”

A splash answers from behind—heavy, wrong. Not a clean drop onto shelf: the Tidewarden runner hits the lower chamber water first, then scrapes onto concrete with a wet slap and a grunt. You hear him cough once, then boots on metal: he’s found the catwalk.

His light swings, painting the plinth’s edges and your cover in a bright, searching arc. “Mara!” he calls, closer than you want. “Don’t make me drag you out.”

The shielded figure’s head snaps toward that voice and they shift their weight, angling to rush you around the plinth—either to grab you or to get past you to the hatch they just named.

The threats are immediate and converging: the runner is on the catwalk within a few seconds’ sprint, and the shielded figure is regaining balance and moving again, now desperate and angry that you disturbed the relay.

#### Turn 82 **[PLAYER]**

I pop up just enough to snag the shielded figure’s sleeve/strap and yank them toward the left end. “Keyed? Then you’re my key—move.” As the runner closes, I slap the relay plinth hard and shout, “One more step and I dump this relay into the drink—whole bay goes live,” then I shove the shielded figure ahead of me toward the service hatch with the yellow wheel.

*Agent reasoning: Two enemies converging; don’t get pinned. Use the keyed-hatch info, force the shielded figure to open it, and slow the runner with the live relay threat.*

#### Turn 83 **[GAME]**

You surge up from cover and get a fistful of the shielded figure’s sleeve strap. It’s not cloth—rubberized webbing over a hard suit seam—and it yanks them off balance. They stumble toward the left end, boots ringing on the catwalk.

“Keyed? Then you’re my key—move.”

They snarl something you don’t catch and try to twist free, but you keep the strap and drive them forward with your shoulder.

You slap the relay plinth as you pass. The concrete thumps; the cradle’s indicator flashes fast-fast-fast, and the faint buzz you heard earlier sharpens into a thin whine that crawls up the catwalk rail. The air smells suddenly sharper—ozone and wet metal.

You shout at the runner, “One more step and I dump this relay into the drink—whole bay goes live!”

The Tidewarden runner slows, but not because he buys the bluff—because he sees the indicator pattern change and hears the whine. He plants his feet wide, light pinned on you and the cradle. “Don’t,” he says, voice gone flat. “That’s not a toy. You arc it, you cook us all.”

He raises one hand, palm out, the other still holding his lamp. He’s cautious now, but he’s still advancing in half-steps, trying to angle for a clean grab without putting himself between you and the water.

At the left end, the service hatch is exactly where the shielded figure said: a low steel door set into the wall with a chipped yellow wheel. Fresh sealant beads around the frame—new work on old concrete.

The shielded figure gets one gloved hand on the wheel and hesitates—then jerks their elbow back hard, trying to smash you in the faceplate area with the edge of their forearm to break your hold. If it lands clean, you’ll lose them right at the hatch.

Behind you, the runner starts moving again, faster now that you’re committed to the door. “Mara—stop! Let her open it and step away!”

The immediate threats are:
- Close-quarters strike from the shielded figure at the hatch.
- The runner closing from behind, ready to grab or tackle on the narrow catwalk.
- The relay cradle whining and flashing in an unstable pattern after you hit it—if it trips or arcs, this whole bay becomes a hazard.

#### Turn 84 **[PLAYER]**

I duck into the elbow, take it on the shoulder, and ram my forearm across their chest to pin them to the hatch. “Spin it or I break your wrist on that wheel,” I hiss, then bark over my shoulder at the runner: “Back off—two steps—or we all fry.”

*Agent reasoning: Speedrun priority is the hatch—get through before the runner can tackle. I’ll eat a glancing hit if needed, pin the shielded figure to the wheel to force it open, and use the unstable relay as deterrent without actually dumping it.*

#### Turn 85 **[GAME]**

You duck, but the elbow still clips you—hard—right on the top of the shoulder where your collar meets the strap line. Pain flashes down your arm and your hand goes numb for half a beat.

You don’t let go.

You drive your forearm across their chest and pin them to the hatch. Their visor bumps the steel with a hollow *gong*. They suck air and claw at your arm with one gloved hand while the other finds the yellow wheel by feel.

“Spin it or I break your wrist on that wheel,” you hiss.

They freeze—then, with a shaky breath, they start turning. The wheel fights like it’s been sealed and recently disturbed; it moves in short, grinding increments. Fresh sealant at the frame stretches and tears with wet little pops.

Behind you, your bark hits the runner. “Back off—two steps—or we all fry.”

The Tidewarden runner actually does it—one, two measured steps back—boots clanging on the catwalk. But he doesn’t lower the lamp. He angles it past you to the relay cradle, watching the flashing like it’s a fuse burning down. “I’m back,” he says, voice tight. “Keep your hands off the cradle.”

The cradle’s whine rises another notch anyway, not from him—its indicator is now cycling in a pattern, too regular to be random. Something is drawing or testing load. The catwalk rail under your pinned arm starts to faintly vibrate.

The wheel gives a final quarter-turn and *clunks*. The hatch seal breaks with a sigh of dry air—warm compared to the bay, smelling of dust and old insulation instead of algae rot. The door cracks open an inch.

The shielded figure uses that moment: they shove backward into you, trying to wedge you between their suit and the door edge, then they twist their wrist to slip your grip. You feel them reaching inside the crack with their free hand for something—latch, chain, or a secondary lock.

At the same time, the runner shifts his weight forward again, reading your commitment to the hatch as an opening. He’s not charging—but he’s close enough now that if he lunges, it’ll be a grapple on a narrow catwalk with open water to one side and a live relay whining behind you.

The immediate threat is a three-way bind: the hatch is open but not clear, the shielded figure is trying to break free while manipulating an inner lock, and the relay cradle is actively cycling—if it arcs, the wet bay becomes lethal.

#### Turn 86 **[PLAYER]**

I slam my boot into the hatch edge to force it wider, then wrench the shielded figure’s reaching wrist down onto the door lip to pin it. “No secondary locks—open it NOW,” I growl, and I shove my shoulder through the gap, dragging them with me as a meat-shield. “Runner—stay there unless you want to light up the bay.”

*Agent reasoning: Hatch is the fastest exit; I can’t risk a grapple or that relay arcing. I’ll force the door fully, disable the shielded figure’s hand, and use the opening as a choke point while moving inside.*

#### Turn 87 **[GAME]**

Your boot hits the hatch edge and the steel answers with a sharp *bang* that rings down the wall. The door jumps wider—two more inches—then stops dead against something inside. Not a free-swinging hatch: there’s a short restraint chain or bar limiting travel.

You wrench the shielded figure’s reaching wrist down onto the door lip. The glove squeals on metal; their wrist hits the edge with a dull, ugly thunk. They gasp—pain, real—and their fingers spasm open. Whatever they were about to do inside, they don’t finish it.

“No secondary locks—open it NOW.”

They choke out, “It’s— not—” and you feel them try to pull their arm back, but you’ve got bone and leverage on the lip.

You shove your shoulder into the gap anyway and force your head and upper torso through. The air inside is dry and warm—until your shoulder catches the restraint chain. It bites into your clavicle area and halts you. You can’t just bull through; you’re half-in, half-out, pinned at an angle with the shielded figure dragged tight against you.

Inside the maintenance corridor, a dim amber glow pulses once—like an indicator waking up. You hear a relay click deeper in, then a low, steady hum starts, as if something just accepted a load.

Back on the catwalk, the Tidewarden runner flinches at the new hum. He doesn’t advance—your threat plus the sound change makes him hesitate—but he does something worse: he drops to a knee and reaches to his belt for a line hook, eyes on your legs and the narrow space you’ve wedged yourself into. “I’m not stepping into your arc,” he says, voice controlled. “I’ll just pull you back out.”

The relay cradle behind you answers the corridor’s hum with a rising whine, syncing—too clean. The indicator goes steady for a full second again.

The shielded figure, pressed between you and the hatch, uses your awkward angle: they drive their helmet back into your face/neck line (wherever they can reach), trying to stun you and free their arm long enough to grab the chain release inside.

Immediate, concrete threats:
- You’re physically stuck on the restraint chain; you can’t fully enter or retreat fast.
- The runner is preparing to snag and yank you off the hatch with a line.
- The relay system is synchronizing with something inside the corridor; if it arcs with the wet bay, it won’t be a scare—it’ll be a kill.

#### Turn 88 **[PLAYER]**

I tuck my chin and slam my head/shoulder forward to spoil their helmet-butt, then jam my forearm across their throat line and bark into the gap, “Chain release—now!” while my free hand gropes inside along the door edge for the chain clip/pin. If I find it, I pop it and dive through, dragging them in and kicking the hatch toward closed behind us.

*Agent reasoning: I’m jammed on the chain and about to get yanked; fastest is to neutralize the shielded figure and get the chain release so I can slip inside before the runner hooks me.*

#### Turn 89 **[GAME]**

You tuck your chin and drive forward. The shielded figure’s helmet-butt turns into a glancing scrape—visor edge skitters off your shoulder/neck instead of cracking your face. It still jolts you, but you keep your balance.

Your forearm jams across their throat line where the suit collar meets the helmet ring. They gag on a filtered breath and their hands come up instinctively to pry you off.

“Chain release—now!”

Your free hand snakes through the crack, feeling along the inside edge: cold steel, then a taut length of chain. The limiter isn’t a simple clip—it’s a stamped bracket with a spring pin seated into a hole. Someone set it up to be quick *for a gloved hand that knows where to press*, not for a blind grab.

You find the pin head anyway. You hook it with two fingers and yank. It doesn’t budge—until you press inward first, then pull. The spring gives with a sharp *snap* and the chain goes slack, slapping your wrist.

You dive through, dragging the shielded figure with you by the front of their suit. Your boot catches the hatch edge on the way in and kicks it toward closed.

Outside, the Tidewarden runner commits the moment you disappear: his line hook flicks out, metal clacking against the hatch frame—too late. The hatch slams most of the way shut on the line, pinching it. The runner yanks; the door shudders but holds on the seal.

Inside the corridor, you and the shielded figure hit the dry floor hard—dust puffs up, gritty in your mouth. The shielded figure twists and tries to roll away, one hand going to their wrist, the other reaching for something at their waist.

The corridor’s amber indicator stays on. The low hum is steady now, like a live feeder. Behind the hatch, the relay cradle’s whine peaks—and then drops into a quieter, loaded tone. Not dead. Working.

The hatch isn’t fully latched; it’s held nearly closed with the runner’s line trapped in the gap. You can hear him outside, breath close and angry: “Open it! You don’t know what you just tied into!”

Then, from deeper in the corridor, a second sound answers the hum: a slow, deliberate *tap… tap… tap* on metal, approaching from the dark ahead—rhythmic, patient, and close enough that it’s already in this corridor system.

I stomp onto the runner’s line at the hatch gap and yank it inward to slack it, then slam my weight into the door to force it shut and trap/strip the hook if I can.

I stomp the runner’s line at the hatch, yank it inward for slack, then drive my shoulder and full weight into the door to slam it shut—if the hook’s in the gap, I try to strip it and leave him holding nothing.

#### Turn 93 **[GAME]**

Your boot stamps down on the line where it’s pinched in the hatch gap. You grab it and yank inward hard.

It gives you a few inches—enough slack to feel the runner outside lose tension—then it bites again. The hook isn’t just caught; it’s braced against the frame.

You ram your shoulder into the hatch and throw your weight. The door slams, metal shrieking on metal. For a half-second it feels like it’ll seat—then the hook head skates, twists, and *pops* through the narrowing gap with a violent snap-back.

The line whips inward with it.

Not clean. Not nothing. The hook tears free, but it comes with a cost: the barbed head lashes across your forearm and opens a hot, stinging line through skin. Immediately wet warmth runs down to your wrist. Outside, the runner grunts and stumbles back, suddenly holding slack rope and cursing.

The hatch finishes closing with a heavy *clunk*. The seal catches. The outside sound drops to a muffled thud as the runner pounds once—then moves off, footsteps retreating fast along the catwalk. He’s not gone; he’s repositioning.

You pivot and fist the shielded figure’s harness. They jerk, but you haul them upright and shove them forward. Your threat lands: their hand freezes halfway to the waist kit, then rises empty and open.

“Walk,” you hiss. “Quiet.”

They stagger into motion, boots scraping dust. The amber-lit corridor runs straight for twenty paces, then angles left around a bulkhead. The tapping is closer now—no longer echoing. It’s on the other side of that bend.

As you push them, the shielded figure finally speaks, voice ragged through the helmet: “If it’s awake, you can’t—”

The tapping stops.

A beat of silence, then a low electrical *tick-tick* like a relay testing contact, coming from ahead at floor level. The steady feeder hum dips for a fraction of a second, as if something just took a bite of load.

Threat, clear and immediate: something in the corridor just changed state and is now close—around the left bend—quiet enough to have heard you, and tied into the live power you just stabilized.

#### Turn 94 **[PLAYER]**

I yank the shielded figure back against the wall and clamp a hand over their chest plate to still them. “What is it—drone, trap, or person? Ten words.”  
Then I kill our noise: crouch, slide up to the corner low, and flick a pebble/bit of grit down the corridor past the bend to draw it out while I stay tight to cover.

*Agent reasoning: Something powered just woke up around the bend; speedrunner move is to avoid contact and get control—use the shielded figure for info and leverage, take the side angle fast.*

#### Turn 95 **[GAME]**

You wrench the shielded figure back into the wall. Their shoulder plate thumps concrete; dust shakes loose. Your palm pins their chest plate; you feel their breathing jump under it.

“Drone,” they whisper, fast. “Line-walker. It sniffs load. It bites wire. It screams.”

Ten words, barely—enough.

You drop into a crouch and slide to the corner, keeping your profile low. The corridor floor here is dry grit over old tile; it still crunches under your knee despite your care. You pinch up a pebble of aggregate and flick it hard past the bend.

It skitters, clicks, then rolls to a stop.

Nothing moves for a heartbeat.

Then a thin, bright *chirp* snaps out—too sharp to be human. It repeats twice, slightly modulated, as if answering itself. The feeder hum trembles again, a quick sag-and-recover.

Something comes into view at floor level: a low, crablike shape the size of a toolbox, hugging the base of the far wall. Its shell is matte and salt-pitted; a small indicator on its back blinks amber-green in time with the chirps. Two stubby armatures probe the ground ahead like feelers.

It pauses exactly where your pebble stopped. One armature touches the pebble, taps it—*tap… tap*—the same rhythm you heard. Then the other armature lifts and angles toward the conduit run along the wall, as if “smelling” the cable.

A third sound joins in: a faint rising whine from inside the unit, like a capacitor charging.

The shielded figure behind you goes rigid under your hand and mouths, without sound: “Don’t let it latch.”

Behind the sealed hatch, muffled through metal, you hear a distant call and bootsteps on the catwalk—more than one set now—moving back toward your position.

The line-walker’s feeler touches the wall conduit and its indicator flips from amber-green to a hard, steady green. The charging whine climbs. It has found the live line, and it’s preparing to do exactly what it was built to do.

#### Turn 96 **[PLAYER]**

I shove the shielded figure out around the corner first, hard, and follow low behind them. As the line-walker commits to the conduit, I stomp/kick it sideways off the wall and into the open, then drop my weight to crush its body before it can latch and scream. If it chirps anyway, I grab the shielded figure and sprint deeper down the corridor, away from the hatch.

*Agent reasoning: Drone’s about to latch and scream; stop it fast and keep moving before Tidewardens stack at the hatch. Use the shielded figure as bait/shield, then disable the drone physically and advance.*

#### Turn 97 **[GAME]**

You slam the shielded figure out first. They stumble into the bend with a sharp boot-scrape and a clipped grunt—loud in the hard corridor.

The line-walker reacts instantly: its steady green indicator flicks to a flashing pattern and it spits a rapid *chirp-chirp-chirp* that turns into a thin, rising squeal.

You’re already moving.

Your boot catches it square from the side just as its feeler armature starts to settle onto the conduit. The unit skids out into the open, flips half over, and its armatures scissor wildly, searching for purchase.

You drop your weight onto it.

There’s a brittle *crack*—ceramic and plastic giving—followed by a sharp metallic *ping* as something inside snaps free. The squeal cuts out mid-note.

But the damage doesn’t end cleanly. One armature, still energized, rakes across the conduit as it dies. There’s a bright blue-white *arc* and a violent pop. The corridor lights stutter; the feeder hum dips hard, then comes back with an ugly, uneven buzz. The air fills with the burnt-sweet stink of scorched insulation.

The line-walker lies twitching, indicator dead. No more chirps.

From behind, at the hatch end of the corridor, you hear the answer to that earlier alarm anyway: boots hammering closer on the catwalk outside and a voice raised—muffled but urgent—“—heard it! In the feeder run—”

The shielded figure, wide-eyed behind their visor, jerks their head down the corridor and hisses, “You just made it *hungry*.”

As if to prove it, a relay somewhere deeper in the run clacks twice—*tick… tick*—and the uneven buzz steadies into a higher, tighter whine. Something downline just reconfigured around the fault you created, and it did it fast.

You can go deeper, but now the corridor behind you is converging footsteps and attention, and ahead the live system is actively responding to what you’ve broken.

#### Turn 98 **[PLAYER]**

I grab the shielded figure’s harness and haul them into a sprint deeper down the corridor, away from the hatch. “Next junction or access niche—now. Point or I drop you.”

*Agent reasoning: We tripped an alarm and drew Tidewardens; lingering gets us pinned at the hatch. Fastest is push deeper to a junction or service niche to break line-of-sight, then decide whether to ditch or use the shielded figure as a guide.*

#### Turn 99 **[GAME]**

You fist the shielded figure’s harness webbing and haul them into a run. They lurch, then find their feet, boots slapping the dry grit as you drive them forward.

“Next junction or access niche—now. Point or I drop you.”

They don’t argue. Their left hand shoots out, stabbing down the corridor. “Service recess—thirty meters. Left. Low door. Jammed—kick it.”

You sprint into the amber wash. The corridor narrows slightly, old cable trays overhead like ribs. The hum is louder here, and the air is warmer—live equipment somewhere close. Your forearm wound slicks your grip; blood smears the harness.

Behind you, the hatch end isn’t just footsteps anymore. Something hits metal—hard—and you hear a shouted order, clearer through the concrete now: “Cut the seal—she’s inside!”

At twenty meters, the floor changes—grated section over a drainage slot. Your steps ring. The shielded figure stumbles on the grate; you keep them upright by the harness and don’t slow.

At thirty, there’s the recess: a shallow alcove on the left with a knee-high panel door and a corroded latch. Above it, stenciled in faded municipal block letters: **HANDHOLE / FEEDER TAP**. The door sits proud by a finger’s width—warped, not fully seated.

The shielded figure plants a boot and kicks. The latch gives with a harsh snap; the door swings inward on one hinge, scraping concrete. A breath of colder air spills out, carrying wet stone and old copper.

Inside is a cramped access crawl: shoulder-width, dropping down at a steep angle. You can fit, but not fast, and not together.

As you reach it, the corridor lights behind you flicker twice—quick, deliberate—like a signal. The hum tightens into that higher whine again, and a new sound threads through it: a faint, fast clicking that’s not footsteps.

The shielded figure points down into the hole with a trembling hand. “Down. Now. Before it sends another walker.”

From the far end behind you, a beam of white light lances around the bend—someone has a strong lamp and they’re closing.

#### Turn 100 **[PLAYER]**

“Down first—move!” I shove the shielded figure into the handhole and drop in right after them, one hand on the hinge to swing the panel mostly shut behind us; if it won’t close, I jam it with my boot and yank the loose latch hardware to make it look seated.

*Agent reasoning: We’re about to get lit up; fastest is to get out of the corridor. The crawl is single-file, so I send them first as a shield/guide and follow immediately, then block the entrance to buy seconds.*

#### Turn 101 **[GAME]**

You bark it and shove. The shielded figure drops into the handhole on their knees, scrabbling for purchase on the steep, gritty slope. Their shoulder clips the sidewall with a hollow *thunk*.

You follow immediately, twisting sideways to fit. The space is tight enough that your packless shoulders still scrape concrete. Your boots find the angled run and you half-slide, half-crawl in after them.

With one hand you catch the warped panel and swing it most of the way shut. It doesn’t seat—one hinge is bent and the door hangs proud. You jam the toe of your boot against the inside edge and lever hard. Concrete grinds; the door shifts a fraction.

The latch hardware is loose and half-ripped. You yank it down and twist it into place like a fake lock. From outside, it now *looks* shut—crooked, but shut.

A second later a white beam washes across the door seam, thin as a knife. It pauses. You hear a breath, then a voice right outside—close enough that the words carry through the gap.

“Here. Handhole panel—warm. Fresh scrape.”

Metal taps the door—*tik… tik*—testing. Another voice, lower: “Don’t open it. If it’s live tap, it’ll arc.”

A third sound answers them: rapid, dry clicking, like a hard insect. Something small skitters past the panel outside, and the light tracks it for a moment.

Inside the handhole, the shielded figure freezes, visor tilted up toward you. In the dim, you can see their pupils wide behind the scratched faceplate. They whisper, “They’ve got a listener.”

Down the crawl, the passage drops another meter into darkness where a cable bundle disappears into a side throat. A faint draft tugs from that direction—cooler, wetter air—suggesting an exit or a larger void beyond.

Outside, the tapping stops. The low voice says, crisp now: “Mark it. Hold this corridor. We wait them out—or we smoke them.”

Something scratches chalk on concrete near the panel. Then the light pulls back, but the rapid clicking remains, circling just outside your door like it’s mapping the seam.

#### Turn 102 **[PLAYER]**

I lean in close to the shielded figure. “Point me to the exit void—now. If you freeze, I leave you.”  
Then I keep low and move down the crawl toward the cable bundle and side throat, careful and quiet, dragging them along by the harness if they hesitate.

*Agent reasoning: They’re camping the panel and have a listener; waiting gets us smoked. Fastest is push deeper into the side throat and put distance/turns between us and the door. Also need the shielded figure to lead without slowing me down.*

#### Turn 103 **[GAME]**

You get your mouth close to their visor. “Point me to the exit void—now. If you freeze, I leave you.”

They swallow audibly. Their gloved hand lifts and points down the slanted run, then angles two fingers toward the cable bundle where it vanishes into the side throat. “Past the bundle—there’s a splice chamber. Half-flooded. Big enough to stand. There’s a ladder ring up—if it isn’t cut.”

You stay low and move. The concrete is damp here; grit turns to a slick paste. The shielded figure hesitates at the steeper drop, and you don’t wait—you drag them by the harness. Their knee pads scrape, loud in the tight space.

Outside the panel, the fast clicking changes pitch—quicker, excited. Something *taps* the metal door from the other side, not a human test: a light, repeated pecking right along the seam you forced.

Then a voice, farther down the corridor outside, calls: “It’s moving—hear it? In the wall.”

Another answers: “Listener’s got it. Don’t open. Find the next access and cut it off.”

You reach the cable bundle: thick, old catenary and feeders wrapped in cracked rubber, cinched with corroded straps. The side throat is a rectangular bite out of the wall, just big enough to worm through. Cold air leaks from it, and with it the smell of stagnant water.

As you push into the throat, your shoulder brushes the bundle. The insulation is heat-soft in places from the live run above; it gives under pressure. A faint static hiss rises.

The shielded figure catches it too and hisses, panicked, “Don’t—don’t press it—”

Too late to undo the contact: a tiny blue spark snaps somewhere in the bundle, bright as a pinprick, and the handhole behind you answers with a sharp *clack*—a relay reacting to the fault.

Immediately, outside, boots start moving again—fast. Someone shouts, “There! It tripped—second panel, downline!”

You’re in the side throat now, both of you, shoulders scraping. Ahead, the passage opens into a larger void: you can hear it—space and water—an echoing drip and the low lap of a half-flooded chamber. But you’ve also just given them a clear indicator of your direction, and they’re repositioning to cut you off at the next access.

#### Turn 104 **[PLAYER]**

I shove through into the splice chamber and whisper, “Find the ladder ring—now.” If it’s there, I haul myself up first and then yank them up by the harness; if it’s cut, I move along the chamber edge in the shallowest water, killing our noise and looking for any secondary duct or overflow culvert to slip into.

*Agent reasoning: We’ve been tagged by the relay trip, so speed matters; get into the splice chamber, break line-of-pursuit, and use water/structure to mask sound. If there’s a ladder ring, we take vertical immediately.*

#### Turn 105 **[GAME]**

You belly out of the side throat and drop into the splice chamber on your hands, then your boots. It’s a squat concrete room with cable racks on three walls and a ceiling lost in dark. Water covers the floor ankle-deep near the throat and rises to mid-shin toward the center, oily with algae sheen. Every drip lands loud.

“Find the ladder ring—now.”

The shielded figure splashes one step, catches themselves, then moves with careful, short shuffles along the wall, palm skimming concrete. You do the same on the chamber edge where the water’s shallowest, forcing your breathing quiet.

They find it—fast. A rusted ladder ring set is bolted into the wall under a square ceiling hatch. But the top three rungs are gone, cut clean, and the hatch above has a new hasp welded across it. Someone sealed it from the other side.

The figure looks back at you and shakes their head once, tight and scared. “Cut. And welded.”

Up in the throat behind you, the rapid clicking returns, louder now—no longer muffled by the panel. Something is coming through the same way you did.

Then: a human voice, close in the throat, amplified by the concrete. “Splice chamber. Don’t go in the water—watch the racks. She’ll hug the wall.”

A bright white beam stabs into the side throat mouth, jittering as whoever holds it tries to see around the bend. The light hits the water and blooms across the chamber, washing your legs and the cable racks in hard glare.

The clicking creature appears at the throat lip: a fist-sized, crab-like walker made of scavenged brackets and ceramic bits, its legs ticking on concrete. A thin wire trails behind it like a leash. It pauses, then drops into the water with a sharp *tink* and starts skittering along the wall toward you, tracking the seam where water meets concrete.

Your “quiet edge” is now a lit line, and the walker is on it.

Along the opposite wall, half-submerged behind a curtain of hanging cable, you spot a low overflow culvert—an oval opening at waterline height. It’s big enough to squeeze through, but you’ll have to wade deeper to reach it.

Behind you, in the throat, boots scrape closer. Someone is about to commit into the chamber.

#### Turn 106 **[PLAYER]**

“Culvert. Now—hold your breath and don’t thrash.”

I grab the shielded figure’s harness and drag them off the wall into the deeper water, cutting straight toward the hanging cable curtain; I kick up one hard splash behind us as a decoy, then shove through the cables and cram us into the oval overflow opening feet-first, getting our bodies out of the beam.

*Agent reasoning: Ladder’s blocked and they’re about to enter; the culvert is the only fast exit. The crab-walker is tracking the wall seam, so we cut across deeper water to break its line and slip through before they flood the room with people/light.*

#### Turn 107 **[GAME]**

“Culvert. Now—hold your breath and don’t thrash.”

You hook two fingers under the shielded figure’s harness webbing and yank them off the wall. Water jumps to your knees, then higher as you cut toward the hanging cable curtain. The shielded figure chokes on a breath and clamps their jaw shut, trying not to flail.

You throw one deliberate, ugly splash behind you—heel scything the surface—sending a fan of water slapping the wall.

It works for half a second.

In the throat, the flashlight beam snaps to the splash with a sharp, trained reflex. A voice barks, “Contact—left!”

But the crab-walker doesn’t care about the decoy. It ticks straight toward the new disturbance—your wake—legs clicking faster as it angles in on you.

You hit the cable curtain. Dead lines and live-feeling jacketed runs slap your shoulders and face. Your forearm catches a loop and yanks it; something above groans as the rack takes the load. The chamber answers with a low metallic shiver.

You shove through anyway and find the oval overflow opening by feel at waterline height. You ram your boots in first, then force your hips through. The concrete edge bites your thighs. Behind you, you haul the shielded figure in by the harness; their visor bumps the lip with a dull *clonk*. They stifle a sound, but it still escapes—small and wet.

The beam loses you as you get your bodies out of its direct line. In the culvert, it’s instantly tighter—shoulders scraping, water cold against your back. It slopes slightly downward; water runs in a thin, constant sheet beneath you.

Back in the splice chamber, you hear the first pursuer step in—splash, careful. “They went into the racks—watch the lines.”

Then a sharp *tink-tink-tink* as the crab-walker hits the cable curtain and starts probing it. The trailing wire goes taut.

A second voice, closer now, says, “Listener’s on a leash. Follow it.”

The threat is immediate and concrete: they’re using the walker to lead them to the culvert mouth, and the leash-wire is already being drawn across the cables toward where you disappeared. If it catches the culvert lip, they’ll know the exact hole.

In the culvert, the shielded figure’s breathing is too fast—fogging their visor in short bursts. Ahead, the duct bends after a few body-lengths into darker flow, and you can hear a faint, distant rush—like water dropping into a larger drain.

#### Turn 108 **[PLAYER]**

“Breath slow. Move—now.”

I shove the shielded figure ahead into the bend and crawl after them hard, then reach back toward the culvert mouth to catch the leash-wire if it skates the lip—yanking it sideways into the water to foul it and snap it if it’s brittle.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to trace us with the leash; we need to break line-of-trace fast and quiet. Use the bend as cover, shove the other along, and if possible snag/cut the wire when it scrapes the lip.*

#### Turn 109 **[GAME]**

“Breath slow. Move—now.”

You shove the shielded figure into the bend. They go, elbows and knees scraping, forcing their breaths into smaller pulls. The culvert narrows a touch at the turn; their harness catches for a second, then pops free with a wet squeal of fabric.

You crawl after them hard, then twist and reach back toward the mouth, arm extended into the colder backwash. For a heartbeat there’s nothing—just the thin sheet of water sliding past your wrist and the echo of voices in the chamber.

Then the leash-wire arrives.

It skates the culvert lip with a faint metallic hiss and taps your knuckles. You hook it and yank sideways, driving it down into the water and against the concrete edge, trying to foul it. The wire bites your palm—thin, sharp. You feel it cut skin.

In the splice chamber, the crab-walker reacts instantly: its clicking turns frantic, and it scrabbles at the curtain as the leash goes taut. You pull harder.

The wire doesn’t snap. It’s newer than it sounded—braided, with a stiff core. Instead, your yank drags the line across the culvert mouth and *saws* it against the lip. You get a moment of slack—enough to think you’ve bought it—

—and then the line jerks back the other way, hard, as someone in the chamber hauls.

Your arm slams into the culvert edge. Pain flashes up to your elbow. The wire slips, leaving a hot slice across your palm, and whips back out of your grasp.

A voice outside, satisfied and close, carries into the duct: “Got it. She’s in the overflow. Hook light—now.”

White light floods the culvert mouth, angled in. It doesn’t reach the bend, but it turns the water between you and the opening into a bright ribbon that gives your position away by wake and shadow.

The shielded figure freezes ahead, then starts moving again when you bump their boot. Their breathing has steadied, but now it’s loud in the tight concrete.

Behind you, you hear boots in the splice chamber shifting to the culvert, and metal clinks—someone handling hardware. The threat is immediate: they’ve confirmed your escape route and are preparing to push something into the duct (a grab hook or a line) to either snag you or force you deeper where the drop-sound is coming from.

Your palm is bleeding into the flow, and the duct ahead slopes toward that distant rush.

#### Turn 110 **[PLAYER]**

“Keep crawling—don’t stop for anything.”

I clamp my bleeding palm against my sleeve, then shove forward hard into the slope toward the rush, aiming to get us past the next bend and to any drop; if we hit a fall, I go first and drag them after, using the water to mask us and break their hook line.

*Agent reasoning: They’ve got the culvert confirmed and are about to fish us with hooks/lines; best play is to create distance fast and use the bend/drop to break line-of-sight. If there’s a vertical drop, commit and let water cover our sound; keep the shielded figure moving.*

#### Turn 112 **[PLAYER]**

“Keep crawling—don’t stop for anything.”

I mash my bleeding palm into my sleeve to slow it, then drive forward down the sloping culvert toward the rushing sound, staying tight to the bend; if it breaks into a drop, I go first and immediately haul them after by the harness to keep us moving and foul any hook line in the churn.

*Agent reasoning: We’re compromised at the culvert mouth; the fastest way to break line-of-sight and any hook/line is to commit deeper past the next bend and use any drop/whitewater as cover.*

#### Turn 113 **[GAME]**

You clamp your palm to your sleeve and crawl hard, forcing speed into the narrow slope. The shielded figure scrapes forward ahead of you, boots skittering in the thin sheet of water.

You hit the next bend too fast.

Your right boot slides on slick silt over broken aggregate. Your knee shoots sideways; your shoulder slams the wall. Something under the silt gives—loose concrete flakes—and your momentum drives you into a rebar nub that’s been waiting in the seam. It bites cloth, then skin at your thigh/hip line, and stops you dead.

The impact makes a sharp, flat *CRACK* that runs down the culvert like a gunshot.

Ahead, the shielded figure jerks, half-turning in panic, their visor catching a smear of your lightless silhouette. They start to come back—then hesitate, trapped by the tightness and your order.

Behind you, from the splice chamber, a voice snaps instantly, closer than before: “Hear that? She ate it. Push the hook—now!”

Metal scrapes on concrete at the culvert mouth. A hooked head or grappling prong clinks in, dragged on a line, probing along the water ribbon. The angled light at the mouth intensifies, and a second shadow leans in, careful not to enter fully.

Water pulses higher for a moment—one of the drowned outskirts’ slow breaths—and the sheet thickens around your ribs. You’re pinned at the bend: your clothing is snagged on rebar, your leg is in the narrowest choke, and the next pulse will float you just enough to tighten the snag if you thrash.

You *can* get free, but not by brute force. You’ll need to go prone, back yourself a half-body length to take tension off the snag, and work the fabric off the rebar point—preferably wrapping it with cloth first—while timing your movement with the water’s retreat. Meanwhile the hook is advancing, clinking closer with each pull, searching for something to catch.

#### Turn 114 **[PLAYER]**

“Don’t come back—keep crawling.”

I flatten fully prone and back myself a half-body length on the water’s retreat to slack the snag, then yank a strip from my sleeve and wrap it around the rebar nub to blunt it. As the next pulse eases, I work the fabric off with short, controlled pushes—then shove a loose chunk of concrete/silt downstream toward the hook to give it something else to catch while I surge after the shielded figure.

*Agent reasoning: I’m snagged and they’re probing with a hook; fastest is to reduce tension, free the fabric cleanly, and keep the hook from reaching us by misdirecting it.*

#### Turn 115 **[GAME]**

You hiss it forward—“Don’t come back. Keep crawling.”—and the shielded figure obeys, pushing on into the dark slope until their boots are just a faint shape ahead.

You go flat, ribs in the water, and wait for the retreat. When it pulls back, you inch yourself a half-body length backward. The snag slackens immediately; the rebar nub stops biting deeper.

You tear a strip from your sleeve with your teeth. It comes away with a wet rip and a sting—your already-cut palm smears blood into the fabric. You wrap the strip around the rebar point, cinch it, and the sharp edge dulls under cloth.

Next pulse comes—water rises, lifts you a finger’s width. You don’t fight it; you use it. Short, controlled pushes: hip, then thigh, then fabric. The cloth on the nub takes the slide instead of your skin. Your pants peel free with a nasty tug, leaving a fresh scrape that burns but isn’t pinned anymore.

At the culvert mouth, the probing hook clinks closer, dragged along the concrete like a blind insect. The light flares again as someone leans in.

You grab a loose chunk of broken concrete and silt from the seam—more silt than stone—and shove it downstream into the thin flow toward the hook.

It works, but not cleanly.

The chunk breaks apart as it slides, and the hook *does* snag something—there’s a quick jerk on the line, a satisfied grunt—then immediate frustration as the line goes slack again.

“Trash,” the voice spits. “She’s still moving. Send the crawler—get eyes in!”

A new sound follows: low plastic scraping on concrete, and the rapid tick of small legs. Something smaller than a person is being pushed into the culvert behind the hook—an inspection crawler or a compact grab-sled—driven by the line, meant to follow you through the bends where their light can’t.

You surge forward after the shielded figure, knee and elbow pumping. Your torn sleeve flaps, and your palm leaves intermittent red smears on the concrete when you plant it wrong.

Ahead, the rushing sound resolves into a real change in grade: the culvert drops into a vertical spill a body-length wide. Water sheets over the lip into darkness. The shielded figure has reached it and is bracing, legs splayed, one hand on the wall—hesitating, listening to you and the pursuit behind.

Behind you, the crawler is in the duct now, coming fast—its scraping is steady and closing, and the line behind it hisses as it feeds.

#### Turn 116 **[PLAYER]**

“Jump. Feet first—don’t grab the lip.”

I hook the shielded figure’s harness, shove them over the spill, and immediately drop after them, twisting as I fall to kick at the crawler’s feed-line if it follows—trying to wrap it on the edge or snag it on debris as we disappear into the plunge.

*Agent reasoning: The crawler will give them eyes; the fastest way to break pursuit is to take the drop and use the churn to tangle/snap its line. No time to scout—commit and pull the other with me.*

#### Turn 117 **[GAME]**

“Jump. Feet first—don’t grab the lip.”

The shielded figure starts to turn—then you’re already on their harness. One hard shove and they go, boots disappearing over the spill. They drop with a startled, muffled cry that the water swallows.

You follow immediately.

The lip flashes past your shoulder. Cold water slaps your face as you fall through the spill-sheet, and you twist mid-drop, hunting for the crawler’s line with your heel.

Your boot catches it.

Not cleanly—more a hook-and-drag. The feed-line snaps tight across the edge above with a high, vibrating *twang*. For a split second you’re yanked sideways in midair, enough to wrench your hip and flare the scrape where the rebar got you. Then the line bites into something sharp at the lip—broken aggregate or a rusted bracket—and starts sawing.

You hit the plunge pool hard, feet first, knees buckling. Water closes over your head. Your torn sleeve balloons; your bleeding palm stings like fire in the churn.

The shielded figure is there, already fighting up, their harness strap in your hand. You both surface in a cramped, roaring sump: a round shaft chamber with a waist-deep boil and a low outlet tunnel that’s half-submerged, sucking water through with a constant pull.

Above, the line screams again—then *pops*.

Something drops after you: the crawler, or part of it, tumbling end-over-end. It hits the water like a brick, splashes once, then immediately gets taken by the outlet’s suction. You see a brief glint—plastic housing, a stubby lamp—before it vanishes into the half-drowned tunnel with a clattering scrape.

From the spill above, a voice echoes down, suddenly sharp with anger: “Line’s cut! She dropped the damn crawler!”

A second voice, farther back: “Get a light down there—NOW. Don’t go in blind.”

The shielded figure coughs, visor dripping, and tries to move toward the outlet—then freezes as the current tugs at their legs. The suction is strong enough to pull you off-balance if you step wrong; the outlet is your only way forward, but it’s actively trying to drag anything loose into it.

And somewhere in that outlet tunnel, the crawler is still scraping—alive or jammed, you can’t tell—making a hard, intermittent *tick…tick…tick* as it’s pushed along ahead of you by the flow.

#### Turn 118 **[PLAYER]**

I grab the shielded figure by the harness strap and bark, “Low and sideways—crawl, don’t stand.” I shove us into the outlet along the wall, keeping my grip as a tether and using my feet to feel for the lip/ledge, pushing into the flow before their light reaches the shaft.

*Agent reasoning: Only exit is the outlet; hesitation means they get lights and follow. Need to control the shielded figure and avoid being sucked in wrong—use harness as tether and go low, fast.*

#### Turn 119 **[GAME]**

“Low and sideways—crawl, don’t stand.”

The shielded figure obeys instantly. You keep a fist in their harness strap like a towline and angle both of you into the outlet with your shoulders against the wall. The current grabs at your hips and tries to spin you, but the wall gives you friction—enough to inch forward instead of getting swept.

Your boots find the lip: a narrow ledge on the left, just under the surface. You plant a heel on it and use it like a rung, pushing you both into the throat of the tunnel. The waterline drops from waist-deep boil to a fast, knee-to-thigh-deep sluice. You’re moving now, crouch-crawling, half-swimming.

Behind you, above the spill, light blooms—someone finally points a lamp down. The shaft brightens in a cone, but you’re already around the first shallow dogleg of the outlet. The light skates across the water and dies against the curve, leaving you in gray-dark again.

Up above, the angry voice carries, distorted by the falling water: “I saw ’em—into the outlet! Don’t let ’em—”

Then the sound changes: boots on concrete at the lip, a quick argument, and the unmistakable clatter of someone preparing to descend without committing to the drop.

In the outlet ahead, the crawler’s *tick…tick…tick* becomes louder—then stops abruptly with a hollow *thunk*. Something has jammed it.

You reach the obstruction within seconds: the tunnel narrows slightly where a partial collapse has left a jagged rib of concrete and rebar protruding into the flow. The crawler’s plastic body is wedged there, lamp still on, its beam shining straight back at you through the water like a low headlight. The current piles against it, making a louder, higher-pressure rush. It’s acting like a strainer—anything loose (cloth, straps, fingers) wants to get pulled into the gap around it.

The shielded figure flinches from the glare and tries to pull their head away, which yanks your tether arm. You both wobble; your scraped hip bangs the wall.

Above and behind, the shaft light intensifies again and a new sound joins it: a line paying out fast, hissing—someone has thrown a rope or feed-cable down and is about to follow the route you took, using the wall to avoid the drop.

You have forward progress, but the jammed crawler is now a hard choke point: to get past, you’ll have to either clear it or squeeze around it while the current tries to pin you to it—and the people behind are setting up to enter the outlet within moments.

#### Turn 120 **[PLAYER]**

“Eyes down. Keep your strap tight—no loose ends.”

I press us flat to the left wall and edge around the crawler’s upstream side, using my shoulder and hip against concrete for friction while I guide the shielded figure by the harness through the narrowest gap. Once we’re past, I plant a boot on the crawler housing and kick it free/downstream to clear the choke and buy us seconds before the rope team rounds the bend.

*Agent reasoning: We’re about to get boxed in; fastest is to use the jammed crawler as a temporary plug, slip past, then dislodge it to slow pursuers. Don’t risk hands in the strainer—use feet/harness and keep the shielded figure from snagging.*

#### Turn 121 **[GAME]**

“Eyes down. Keep your strap tight—no loose ends.”

You flatten to the left wall where the ledge gives you a few extra inches. The crawler’s lamp glares up through the water, turning the tunnel into a strobing smear every time the surface ripples.

You shove the shielded figure ahead by the harness, guiding their shoulder through the narrow gap between the wall and the wedged plastic. It’s tight enough that their tank/pack (whatever’s under that shielded rig) scrapes concrete with a squeal. The current tries to suck the loose harness tail toward the strainer gap, but your hand clamps it short and you physically pin their strap against their back as you push.

They make it past.

You follow, sliding your hip and shoulder along the wall for friction. Your torn sleeve catches a rebar whisker and rips again, but you keep moving. For a second your boot slips off the submerged ledge and the current yanks your shin toward the crawler—hard enough that your knee bangs the housing with a dull *clack*—then you recover and get your weight back onto the wall.

Now you’re downstream of it.

You plant your boot on the crawler’s casing and kick.

The first kick just flexes it in the jam. The second kick bites: you feel the housing shift, and a hidden rebar tooth that was pinning it snaps free with a metallic *ping*. The crawler lurches, rotates, and the current takes it immediately—yanking it out of the choke and shooting it downstream past your legs.

It doesn’t just “clear the choke.” It clears it violently.

A sudden surge of backed-up water slams through the gap you just threaded. The shielded figure gets clipped in the calves and almost faceplants; your grip on their harness keeps them from being swept fully off the wall, but you both get dragged a half-meter forward on your knees.

Upstream, around the bend, you hear the rope team hit the change in flow.

A voice barks, sharp and close now: “—current just changed! Something moved!”

Another answers, strained, as if bracing on the wall: “Hold the line—HOLD—”

Then a wet slap and a grunt as someone loses footing briefly and catches themselves. They’re in the outlet, but the sudden surge has made their entry messier and slower.

Downstream, the crawler clatters away ahead of you, lamp still on, bouncing off the tunnel floor and walls—its light now a moving beacon that will guide anyone chasing you through the bends unless it dies or gets buried.

The immediate threat is clear: you bought seconds by disrupting the rope team’s footing, but you also sent a bright, obvious marker ahead into your only route forward.

#### Turn 122 **[PLAYER]**

“Keep moving—don’t look back.”

I lunge after the crawler, stomp the housing hard to try to crack it or flood the lamp, then immediately grab the shielded figure’s harness and push us onward at a crawl-run along the wall, aiming for the next bend to break line-of-sight from the shaft light.

*Agent reasoning: The crawler’s lamp will breadcrumb our path; fastest fix is to kill or blind it without stopping long, then keep moving before the rope team stabilizes.*

#### Turn 123 **[GAME]**

“Keep moving—don’t look back.”

You lunge after the crawler, catching up as it skitters along the tunnel floor in the shallowest part of the flow. You bring your boot down hard.

Plastic cracks with a sharp *snap* and the housing caves. The lamp flares white for half a heartbeat—then gutters as water floods the broken seam. The beam collapses into a weak, underwater glow and finally dies completely. The crawler still scrapes forward for another meter, then goes quiet, tumbling once and lodging against a silt ridge.

Dark returns—real dark.

You’re back on the shielded figure’s harness immediately, shoving them onward in a low crawl-run along the left wall. With the light gone, you’re moving by touch: concrete texture under your palm, the ledge under your boot, the current’s tug at your calves.

You reach the next bend and round it. The shaft’s spill-light is gone now; line-of-sight breaks clean. The sound of pursuit is still there, though—water noise plus human noise, closer than you’d like.

From behind the bend, a voice snaps: “Light’s out! She killed it—she’s close!”

Another voice, lower and more controlled: “Keep the line. Feel the wall. Don’t chase the sound—follow the flow.”

Ahead, the outlet tunnel changes character: the ceiling drops. The air gap shrinks to a handspan in places, forcing you and the shielded figure into a half-submerged crawl. The current accelerates through the constriction, and the waterline rises to your chest when the floor dips.

Your shielded companion hesitates at the first low section, instinctively lifting their head—and bangs their visor/faceplate on the concrete with a hollow *bonk*. They curse, muffled, and their knees slip. The flow tries to roll them sideways into the deeper channel.

You can keep them pinned to the wall by the harness, but the next thirty feet are a nasty choice made physical: stay high on the wall-ledge and scrape through the low air gap, or drop into the deeper center and risk being pushed under by the fast water and the constricted ceiling.

Behind you, the rope line hisses again—closer. They’re rounding the bend by feel, and now they don’t need the crawler’s lamp to do it.

#### Turn 124 **[PLAYER]**

“On my shoulder—now. Breathe when I tell you.”

I haul the shielded figure tight by the harness and drop us into the deeper center channel, using my body as a wedge and kicking hard to drive us through the constriction fast, forcing their head low and forward while I feel for the next rise in floor to pop us back to air.

*Agent reasoning: We need speed and separation; the rope team’s advantage is the wall/line, so I’ll take the riskier center to avoid scraping slow through the low ledge, and I’ll physically control the shielded figure so they don’t get rolled under.*

#### Turn 125 **[GAME]**

You drop into the deeper center channel with them cinched to your shoulder by the harness, and the current immediately takes you—fast, cold, heavy. Your boots lose the ledge and for a moment you’re both just bodies in a pipe, driven by water.

It works: you shoot into the low-ceiling section with speed instead of getting stuck scraping along the wall.

It also costs you air.

The ceiling kisses the surface—barely a handspan—and the constriction forces your head down. You keep the shielded figure’s faceplate low and forward like you said, but the flow bucks over uneven concrete. A standing wave slaps you in the mouth and nose; you swallow brackish water and your throat locks for a second.

The shielded figure panics on instinct and tries to inhale at the wrong time. You feel it through their body: a sudden convulsion, a choke that turns into a muffled, wet cough inside the mask/hood. Their hands claw at your forearm and harness strap, not to fight you, but to find “up” that isn’t there.

You kick hard anyway, using your hips as a wedge to keep them from rolling. Something hard—rebar stump or broken aggregate—rakes your shin as you pass, tearing fabric and skin. The pain is sharp and immediate; warm blood threads into the cold flow.

Three body-lengths in, the floor rises like you were hoping. The current lifts you both, and you get a pocket—an actual air gap you can use. You shove the shielded figure up first.

“NOW,” you get out, more a rasp than a word.

They break the surface and suck air—ragged, wheezing. It’s air, but it’s thin and stinks of algae rot and old concrete. Their next breath turns into coughing again, wet and ugly, like they pulled water past a seal.

Behind you, around the bend, the rope team hits the same constriction. You hear a shout cut off by a splash and a hard *bang* of someone striking concrete. The line goes taut with a twang.

A voice—different from the earlier angry one, calmer—barks orders that carry through the water: “Don’t fight it. Let it take you through. Heads down. One at a time!”

They’re adapting.

Right now, you and the shielded figure are in a short, cramped air pocket with the low ceiling still forcing you to crouch half-submerged. The threat is immediate and specific: the shielded figure is coughing and may have aspirated water, and the pursuers are seconds to a minute behind and now know the technique to push through the choke.

#### Turn 126 **[PLAYER]**

I grip their harness hard and snap, “Spit it out—short breaths. You can cough after we’re clear.” 

I feel along the ceiling/wall for any side pipe, rung, or maintenance notch; if I find one, I shove them into it first and follow to get out of the main flow. If there’s nothing, I force us back under and drive forward through the next low section fast, counting with hand squeezes—one squeeze for “hold,” two for “breathe.”

*Agent reasoning: We’ve got maybe seconds before they pop through; the companion’s compromised so we can’t dawdle. Best is keep moving immediately, use any side feature/manhole to break pursuit, and if none, push through the next stretch before they regroup—also keep them breathing and not panicking.*

#### Turn 127 **[GAME]**

“Spit it out—short breaths. You can cough after we’re clear.”

The shielded figure tries. They spit a string of brackish water and take two fast, shallow pulls that sound wrong—raspy, bubbling at the edges—then clamp down hard, forcing the cough back like you ordered. Their whole body trembles with the effort.

You keep one fist in their harness and use the other to sweep the ceiling and left wall. Concrete—slime—then a seam. Your fingers find a metal edge: an old ladder rung set into the wall, half-buried in calcified silt. One rung, then another. Not a ladder up—more like a short maintenance “step” line leading into a rectangular bite in the wall.

A side notch. Tight, but real.

You shove them into it first. They wedge sideways, shoulders scraping, and for a second they stick—harness catching on a jag of rebar. You yank hard; the strap slides free with a squeal, and they tumble into the notch on their knees, coughing they can’t hold back anymore. It’s wet and violent, echoing in the small space.

You follow, hauling yourself off the main flow. In the notch, the water is lower—thigh-deep—and the current is a sluggish swirl instead of a pull. You can both breathe without being forced under, but the air is hot-stale here, like a sealed utility void that’s been “closed” for years.

Outside, in the main channel, you hear the rope team arrive at the air pocket you just left. A head breaks the surface with a gasp.

“Where—?” someone pants.

“Check the wall!” the calmer voice orders, immediate. “She’ll take a recess if there is one—hands on concrete!”

Light blooms around the bend: not a crawler lamp—this is a real beam, steadier, brighter. They’ve brought a hand light through.

The beam sweeps the ceiling line and catches the ladder rungs you just used. It pauses there.

“Rungs!” a diver hisses. You hear the rope line scrape as they pull themselves toward the wall.

In your notch, the shielded figure’s coughing fits into shorter bursts, but each one is loud. They try to stifle it against their forearm; it turns into a wheeze.

You bought refuge from the current, not from pursuit. The threat is immediate: they’ve found the entry markers and are closing on the notch, and your companion’s compromised breathing is giving you away by sound.

#### Turn 128 **[PLAYER]**

I clamp a hand over the shielded figure’s mouth/vent area and hiss, “Quiet. Nod if you can move.” 

With my free hand I feel past them into the notch for any continuation—crawlspace, valve gallery, vertical ladder—anything. If it goes, I shove them forward immediately; if it dead-ends, I slip back to the rung edge, kill my own profile in the dark, and when the light hits the opening I kick at the lamp/hand and yank the rope line to dump the lead pursuer into the flow, then bolt back into the notch dragging my partner.

*Agent reasoning: They’re seconds out and have a light; hiding won’t work with coughing. Fastest is deeper into the notch if it leads anywhere, otherwise make a quick ambush at the choke to buy a gap and run.*

#### Turn 129 **[GAME]**

You clamp your palm over the shielded figure’s mouth/vent area. Their next cough hits your hand as a hot, wet shudder. They flinch—eyes wide behind whatever they’re wearing—but they understand. They give you a small, tight nod: yes, they can move.

You feel past them into the notch.

It continues—but not as a generous passage. It’s a service crawl, rectangular and mean, sloping upward at a shallow angle. The first few feet are open enough to belly-crawl, then it necks down where old cable trays and mineral crust have narrowed it. Air moves through it: a faint draft that smells less like algae and more like dust and old insulation.

You shove them forward immediately. They go, scraping, shoulders catching. Their breathing is audible but muted now, forced small by your hand and the tight space. You follow, pushing at their boots and harness to keep them from freezing up at the pinch point.

Behind you, the searchlight beam lands squarely on the rung line and then the notch. It holds there.

“Hole,” the calmer voice says, close. “She’s in it.”

A gloved hand appears at the opening, fingers probing into the dark. The light tries to angle in—but the beam can’t get far past the first bend of the crawl.

“Too tight,” someone growls. “I’m not fitting with tanks.”

“Then strip,” the leader snaps. “Line stays on. One man goes in—no light inside, she’ll take it.”

Metal clinks. You hear a harness being unbuckled in haste, breath loud in the pocket outside. They’re committing to the crawl.

You force your partner through the narrowest choke. Their shoulder finally pops past with a gritty scrape that makes them jerk; they almost gasp, but you press them onward. Your own shoulders follow—painful, but you fit.

Then your hand finds something important: a cable bundle, still sleeved, running along the right side—recently re-tied with clean wire twists. New work in an old crawl.

At the notch entrance, the pursuers’ light vanishes for a beat as someone shifts position. A voice mutters, very near: “I’m going.”

A bare forearm slides into the opening. Fingers hook the rung edge, then reach deeper, feeling for you.

They’re seconds from making contact in the dark, and if they get a grip on your ankle or your partner’s harness, the rope team outside can simply haul you both back out into the flow.

I hook my fingers under the newly-tied cable bundle and rip it hard toward me, trying to tear it free and drag it across the crawl as a snag. Then I kick backward blindly at the reaching arm and hiss to my partner, “Crawl. Don’t stop—follow the cable.”

#### Turn 133 **[GAME]**

You get both hands under the cable sleeve and heave.

It doesn’t peel cleanly. Whatever’s “new” is the tie—what it’s tied *to* is old and stubborn. The sleeve bites your palms; the bundle shifts an inch, then another, and something gives with a sharp *ping*—a fresh wire twist snapping. The cable whips sideways across the crawl, sagging into a loose arc.

That arc is enough.

The reaching arm at the entrance pushes in farther, fingers searching. Your boot heel slams back into forearm and wrist. You feel bone under neoprene. The hand jerks, slaps the concrete, and withdraws with a choked hiss.

“Fuck—she kicked—!” the crawler says, voice tight with pain.

Outside, the leader barks instantly: “Hold him. Don’t let her take the line—get the light back on that hole!”

The searchlight flares at the entrance again, but it can’t see past the first bend—just your boot soles sliding away and the cable now hanging across like a tripwire.

You hiss to your partner. They crawl—fast, ugly, determined—dragging themselves by forearms, boots scraping. They keep one hand on the cable like you told them, using it as a guide in the dark.

Behind you, the injured pursuer tries again, this time leading with shoulder and head. The cable you dragged across catches him at the throat/shoulder line. He makes it half a body-length in before he’s pinned awkwardly, choking and swearing as he fumbles at it.

Then the real consequence hits: the cable isn’t dead.

A low, rising hum blooms through the sleeve—like a transformer waking up. The bundle twitches against your fingers, vibrating. Somewhere ahead, in the crawl’s direction, a relay or junction takes the load and the cable gives a sudden, hard *shiver*.

Your partner yelps as a blue-white snap jumps from the abraded sleeve to the damp concrete near their elbow. Not a full strike—more like a hungry bite—but it leaves a sharp, acrid smell and a blistering scorch mark.

The pursuer at the entrance freezes mid-curse.

“—It’s live!” he yells, panic cutting through the bravado. “It’s fucking live in here!”

Outside, the leader’s voice goes tight and controlled: “Back out. Now. Don’t touch the cable.”

You’ve bought a few seconds: they won’t follow into a live crawl blind. But you’re in a damp, narrowing conduit with an energized line you just tore loose and dragged across your only path. One wrong contact—your skin, your partner’s wet gear, the metal in their harness—and the crawl becomes a kill box.

#### Turn 134 **[PLAYER]**

“Off the cable—now.” I grab the harness strap and yank my partner a half-body left, away from the sleeve, then use my boot to shove the live bundle down against the right wall and pin it there while we belly-crawl past without touching it.

As soon as I see any junction box, breaker can, or splice ahead, I go straight for it to kill power; if there’s no shutoff, I pull out my knife and only cut if I can do it through dry strap/cloth as insulation—otherwise we keep moving, slow and clean, no metal scraping.

*Agent reasoning: Live line in a wet crawl is a hard no—fastest safe move is to stop using it as a guide, isolate it from us, and get past it without contact; if there’s a junction/box ahead, kill power or cut it with insulated tools if I have any.*

#### Turn 135 **[GAME]**

You yank your partner by the harness hard enough to peel them off the cable line. Their shoulder thumps the left wall; they grunt but keep moving. The live bundle is still quivering where you dragged it—sleeve abraded, copper close enough to taste in the air.

You plant your boot on it and grind it into the right wall. The vibration thrums up your shin like a tuning fork. For a heartbeat the sleeve smokes where rubber meets rough concrete, then the cable settles into a pinned curve. The crackle stops—no more arcing in front of your partner’s elbow.

You both belly-crawl past, keeping hips and elbows tight to the left. Your partner follows your line, careful now, breathing shallow.

Behind you, at the entrance, the pursuers don’t come in. You hear them shifting, not advancing—boots on concrete, someone retching a cough. The leader’s voice is clipped and close to the hole: “Mark it. Nobody in. Get me a hook-pole and a dry line. She can’t run forever in a crawl.”

A second voice—lower, uncertain—adds: “It’s humming like a feeder. Choir shit.”

Ahead, the conduit widens just enough to turn your head. You catch the dull outline of a squat metal can bolted to the ceiling: a junction housing, old municipal style, but with newer fasteners—clean hex heads that haven’t bloomed with rust. A short length of the same sleeved cable disappears into it.

You reach it and immediately feel heat: not burning, but warm like a live panel. There’s no external breaker handle—just a stamped lid with four corner bolts and a warning plate half-scraped away.

You can’t “switch it off” from outside. To kill it you’d have to open it, and that means metal on metal in a damp crawl with a live feed.

While you’re under it, your light (or whatever dim glow you have) catches something else: a thin copper filament laid along the left wall at knee height—newer than the concrete, almost invisible unless you’re looking for it. It runs toward the junction can, like a sense wire or trip line.

Your partner’s whisper comes ragged: “Mara—my arm.” Their sleeve is scorched near the elbow; skin beneath looks angry and wet. They can still crawl, but they’re shaken.

Behind you, the search team doesn’t enter—but you hear the scrape of something being dragged up to the entrance: a pole or hook, probing length. They’re adapting. And the live bundle you pinned? It’s starting to hum louder again as load shifts—your boot won’t hold it forever.

I slide my knife out and, using the handle/flat (not the blade), I pin the thin copper filament to the wall and shove it down under a concrete lip so we don’t snag it, then I push past the warm junction can without opening it and drag my partner forward by the harness to gain distance before the hook reaches us.

*Agent reasoning: Opening a live junction in a wet crawl is suicide; fastest is to keep moving, avoid the trip filament, and put distance before they probe in with a hook. Partner’s arm needs quick triage without stopping long.*

#### Turn 137 **[GAME]**

“Keep crawling—arm later. Don’t touch any wire, not even hair-thin.”

Your knife comes out slick in your palm. You flip it and use the flat of the handle like a thumb. The copper filament is finer than it looked—springy, work-hardened. When you press it into the wall it resists, then yields with a faint *tink* as it slides under a chipped concrete lip.

For half a second, nothing.

Then the warm junction can above you answers with a soft internal click—like a relay acknowledging a change. The feeder hum you’d been hearing shifts pitch, and a tiny red point—an LED the size of a pinhead, hidden under the can’s rim—flares once and dies.

You didn’t cut the filament, but you definitely *moved* it. Whatever it was sensing now knows it was disturbed.

You shove past the can without opening it, keeping your shoulder off the metal. You grab your partner’s harness strap and drag them forward. They scramble to keep up, boots scraping, breath loud in the tight space.

Behind you, the hook arrives.

Metal scrapes at the entrance, then the hooked end clatters into the crawl and starts fishing blind. It catches the live cable bundle you pinned, tugs it, and the bundle snaps free of your boot’s pressure with a harsh *rrrrp* of sleeve against concrete. The hum spikes. A bright blue snap jumps from the abraded sleeve to the hook’s tip.

A man screams—sharp, involuntary—followed by the hook pole clanging as it’s dropped.

“LET GO—LET GO!” someone yells outside.

The leader barks over it, furious: “Hands off metal! Use the dry line! DRY LINE!”

You gain distance while they regroup, but the crawl itself turns meaner: the air ahead tastes hotter and sharper, like ozone. The feeder hum is now behind you and above you through the concrete, as if the junction can is routing load elsewhere.

Your partner’s scorched elbow bumps the wall; they choke back a sound and keep crawling.

As you round the next shallow bend, you see why the air changed: the conduit ahead is threaded with more of that hair-thin copper, crisscrossed in shallow X’s near the floor like snares—some slack, some taut—leading toward another dark box recessed in the right wall.

This isn’t random wiring. It’s a deliberately instrumented crawl, and you’ve just told it you’re here.

#### Turn 138 **[PLAYER]**

“Freeze. Eyes on the floor—those X’s are trip.”

I press myself flat, then slide my knife sheath/handle ahead as a feeler to find a gap, guiding my partner by the harness to crawl over the least-taut wire line without snagging it; if there’s no clean gap, I shift to the right wall and inch past the recessed box without touching it, moving slow for five seconds now to go fast later.

*Agent reasoning: The crawl is trapped with sensor wires; fastest is to avoid triggering more and slip past the box rather than messing with live electronics. I’ll use minimal contact, go high/low where the X-snares aren’t, and keep the partner moving.*

#### Turn 139 **[GAME]**

You flatten out until your ribs bite concrete and ease the knife sheath forward like a blind man’s cane.

The first X-snag is real: two hair-thin copper lines cross about a handspan off the floor, anchored with fresh epoxy dots. Your sheath nudges one and it gives a millimeter—taut enough to sing, not enough to slack. You pull back before it can vibrate.

You probe again, slower. There’s a gap—but it’s not where you want it. The only clean lane is tight to the right wall, directly under the recessed wall box.

You signal your partner by tension on the harness and inch right. Your shoulder passes within a finger-width of the box’s faceplate. It’s unlit and looks dead, but the concrete around it is cleaner, recently scrubbed.

You commit to the lane. You lift your chest just enough to slide forward without scraping.

Your partner follows—and their scorched elbow betrays them. The fabric is stiff and catches the lowest line. You feel it through the harness: a tiny *tick* transmitted up the wire, too light to be a full snag but enough to pluck it.

The recessed wall box answers immediately.

A sharp internal *click*, then a thin tone—barely audible, like a mosquito whine—starts pulsing in the conduit. Not loud, but unmistakably intentional. The copper X’s don’t move; nothing “springs.” This isn’t a snare meant to trip you physically. It’s an alarm and a locator.

From behind, muffled through the bend, you hear the leader outside the entrance snap to it: “There—hear that? She’s on the instrumented run. Keep the dry line moving. Don’t rush the feeder.”

A different voice (closer than before, uncertain) mutters: “Choir wiring… Why would the Choir wire this close to Nine?”

The immediate threat is now clear: they can track you by the tone and close in with nonconductive gear. And the box you’re brushing past is likely the node that’s listening.

You do get past the first set of X’s without fully snagging them, but the conduit ahead continues with more filament runs—denser, closer together—leading deeper along the right wall. The tone keeps pulsing, steady as a metronome, marking your position as you crawl.

#### Turn 140 **[PLAYER]**

I grit my teeth. “That tone’s our leash—cover your ear and crawl on my pull.”

I press my sleeve and a wad of cloth (shirt tail) hard over the recessed box seam to muffle it, then jam a small dry chip of concrete into the gap to crush/pin whatever’s vibrating without using the blade; if it doesn’t shut up in two seconds, I abandon it and drag my partner forward—fast—staying low and keeping us off the right-wall wire runs.

*Agent reasoning: The tone is a tracker; fastest fix is to stop it or spoof it. Opening boxes is risky, so I’ll try to physically muffle/damage the sounder with minimal metal contact, then move fast while they hesitate about the live feeder.*

#### Turn 141 **[GAME]**

You slap your sleeve and a torn wad of your shirt-tail over the recessed box seam and lean your weight into it. The tone dulls a hair—still there, but less sharp.

You find a dry concrete chip in the grit and jam it into the seam like a wedge, grinding with your thumb.

The box doesn’t “buzz” the way you hoped. It *clicks* again—harder—and the tone stutters for a fraction of a second like you’ve interrupted it… then comes back louder, higher, and faster. The LED you didn’t see before flashes twice through a pinhole near the faceplate.

You’ve made it worse: whatever’s inside is now in an alert state, not just a passive ping.

Worse still, your cloth and sleeve are now pressed against a live environment. Not full feeder voltage, but enough: you feel a hot sting through damp fabric at your forearm—like a wasp bite—followed by a numb prickle. You jerk back instinctively. No burn-through, but it’s a warning: the box has potential on it, or it’s capacitively coupled to the run.

Behind you, the pursuers react immediately to the new cadence.

“That’s a confirm!” the leader barks, voice carrying around the bend. “She touched the node. Keep the dry line—hook stays OUT. Two up, slow and steady!”

You hear the rasp of something being unspooled—rope, not metal—then a soft *thup* as a weighted line is fed into the crawl. They’re preparing to snake it forward, either to snag harness straps or to trip you without shocking themselves.

You abandon the box inside your two seconds and drag your partner forward by the harness, faster. Staying off the right wall is harder now: the wire runs are denser and the “safe” lane narrows to a shallow groove down the center. Your partner’s breathing turns ragged; their injured arm trembles but they keep to your pull.

The tone continues—now rapid, insistent—tracking with you as you move. It isn’t muffled anymore. It’s following the circuit deeper ahead, meaning there are more nodes, not just the one you tried to choke.

#### Turn 142 **[PLAYER]**

“Unclip anything that dangles—now. If you’ve got a belt loop or strap, tuck it.”

I snap my own loose straps tight and smear my shirt-tail back flat, then speed-crawl down the center groove, listening for any change in airflow or a drop shaft; if I spot a side access or vertical riser, I take it immediately and kick grit back behind us to foul their dry line.

*Agent reasoning: The alarm’s now in full alert and they’re feeding a dry line to snag us. Fastest way to break pursuit is to force a choice point—water/vertical/maintenance hatch—anything the line can’t follow, and to make ourselves harder to hook by shedding snag points.*

#### Turn 143 **[GAME]**

Your partner fumbles at their harness with one good hand. A loose strap gets tucked; a metal clip stays—no time to unthread it without stopping. They nod once, jaw clenched, and keep moving when you pull.

You cinch your own slack down and smear the shirt-tail flat to stop it snagging. Then you commit to the center groove and speed-crawl.

The tone stays rapid, but your ears catch something else: the airflow ahead changes—cooler, moving left-to-right across the tunnel instead of straight down it. That usually means a side access that’s breathing into a larger void.

Three body-lengths ahead, you find it: a narrow side cut, half-choked with cable stubs and flaked conduit, but it drops into a vertical riser shaft—dry rungs bolted into concrete, going up into black.

You take it immediately, pivoting hard left and hauling your partner after you. As you climb, you kick grit and loose aggregate back into the crawl mouth.

It works—partly. The grit avalanches down the groove and pings off the copper filaments with tiny ticks. Not enough to set off a new cadence (it’s already screaming), but it does make the floor behind you unstable and dusty.

Below, the pursuers’ dry line arrives. You hear the weighted end scrape into the grit and then *stick*, dragging sluggishly instead of sliding clean.

“Line’s fouled,” someone reports, irritated.

“Push it through,” the leader snaps. “She went left—air changed.”

A pale beam slices into the crawl mouth—kept low, careful not to rake the wires. They’re adapting fast.

Up the riser, your hands find rungs that are dry but slick with salt. Your partner’s injured arm slips once; you catch their harness and they slam a knee into the concrete, swallowing a cry.

Above you, a hatch outline appears—newer bolts, different metal than the surrounding frame. It’s shut, but there’s a narrow gap at one corner where air is leaking through, cold and clean compared to the crawl.

From below, the tone is still audible, but muffled by the shaft. The immediate threat is clear: they can’t follow fast through the wired crawl with metal, but they *can* feed rope up the riser or climb after you if they commit to it.

#### Turn 144 **[PLAYER]**

I climb fast to the hatch, brace my boots on the rungs, and test the corner gap with my knife tip for a latch. “Up—now. One hand, use your legs.” If I can’t pop it in two seconds, I start backing the bolts out just enough to pry, then haul the hatch open and shove my partner through first, listening for rope or boots starting up the riser.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is the fastest exit and the cold clean air suggests a safer space; we need to breach it before they can get a line up the shaft. I’ll force it quietly if possible, then pull my partner through and block pursuit.*

#### Turn 145 **[GAME]**

You climb hard, boots biting the rungs, and get your knife tip into the corner gap. There’s no simple latch. The edge flexes a fraction—enough to tell you it’s seated against a gasket and held by those new bolts.

You give it your two seconds anyway: a twist, a lever. Nothing. The hatch doesn’t pop; it just gives a dull, stubborn *thunk* back into its frame.

So you go to the bolts.

They’re hex-heads, not rusted slots—fresh enough that your knife is the wrong tool. You can’t “back them out” cleanly; you can only worry at them. You manage to turn one bolt maybe a quarter-turn by jamming the knife in the head and torquing, but the blade slips and skates. The bolt doesn’t come free.

Your partner is climbing, fast but ugly. “Legs,” you bark, and they do it—one hand, feet punching. Their breathing is loud in the shaft.

Below, you hear the pursuers commit. Boots on rungs now, not just rope: two sets, climbing cautiously but climbing. A rope weight taps metal—*ting… ting…*—as they send it up after you.

“Don’t touch the damn wires,” someone warns from below. “Riser’s clean—go, go.”

You make a decision on the fly: you can’t open it properly, but you can try to force it.

You wedge the knife into the corner seam and pry with your forearm and shoulder. The gasket squeals. The hatch shifts—just enough that the corner gap widens, and a stronger spill of clean air hits your face.

Then something inside the frame grabs. Not a latch—an internal catch meant to resist prying. The hatch *does* move, but it bites your knife and twists it sideways. You feel the steel flex, protesting.

You can keep forcing and risk snapping the blade, or you can drop back down the shaft before the climbers reach your level.

Your partner reaches your boots, panting, eyes wide. “It’s—stuck.”

Below you, the first climber is maybe six rungs down from the crawl mouth, coming steady. The rope line is being fed up behind them, ready to snag a leg or harness if it gets purchase.

#### Turn 146 **[PLAYER]**

“Back down—now. Feet on rungs, don’t look down.”

I yank my knife free, drop two rungs fast, and start hammer-kicking the riser wall to rain grit and loose concrete straight onto the climbers and their rope weight, then keep descending to the side cut to take the next branch away from this sealed hatch.

*Agent reasoning: Knife is too valuable to snap and the hatch is hardened; fastest is to deny them the riser by using gravity and debris, then relocate to another exit rather than die at a dead end.*

#### Turn 147 **[GAME]**

“Back down—now. Feet on rungs, don’t look down.”

Your knife comes free with a sharp *skree* and a jerk that nearly takes you off balance. You drop two rungs fast, then start hammer-kicking the riser wall.

The riser answers: not with a neat rain of grit, but with a nasty, hollow *crack* as a skin of old concrete delaminates. Chunks—fist to palm-sized—break loose along with dust and silt. They don’t just pepper the climbers; they come down like thrown rocks.

The first climber below throws an arm up and takes a chunk on the forearm with a wet *thud*. He yelps and loses a rung for half a second, boots scraping metal. The rope weight below him gets clipped by falling debris and swings, slamming into the rungs—*clang-clang*—before dropping. The line goes slack, then jerks as someone below hauls it back.

“Cover your face!” the leader barks from lower down. “Shield up—keep moving!”

They don’t retreat. They adapt: the second climber stops, presses tight to the ladder, and uses their shoulder and forearm like a shield while the first keeps climbing through the falling dust.

Your partner, already shaky, flinches at the noise and the dust. They start down after you, but their injured arm slips again; they catch themselves with their legs, scraping a knee hard enough to leave a dark smear on the rung.

You keep descending. The air in the shaft turns gritty; every breath tastes like powdered lime and rust.

By the time you reach the side cut, you’ve bought seconds—not distance. The climbers are still coming, slower now but steady, coughing and swearing, rope line retracted and being re-fed more carefully.

You drop into the side access and drag your partner after you. The wired crawl beyond is still there—center groove, dense runs on the right, and that rapid alert tone deeper in. Your kicking has also changed the shaft: debris now litters the rungs and the throat of the side cut, making the footing worse for *everyone*—including you if you have to come back this way.

As you push into the crawl, you hear the leader below the riser call out, clearer than before:

“She’s doubling back into the wire lane. Don’t chase with metal. Send the hook-pole man to the mouth—now.”

That means they’re not just following; they’re trying to get ahead of you from the other end.

#### Turn 148 **[PLAYER]**

I grab my partner’s collar/harness and hiss, “No more straight lines—they’re cutting us off.” We backtrack ten meters just enough to hit the first junction/maintenance notch I remember, then I take the lowest, wettest bypass I can find and smear both our fronts in mud to kill snag points; as we move, I shove loose debris into the center groove behind us to foul any rope line without pinging the right-wall wire runs.

*Agent reasoning: They’re trying to leapfrog to the other mouth; staying in the main crawl is a trap. I need an alternate route fast—preferably a maintenance bypass or wet line they won’t risk—and I need to slow the climbers without touching the wires.*

#### Turn 149 **[GAME]**

You clamp your partner by the harness and pull them backward. “No more straight lines—they’re cutting us off.”

Backtracking in the groove is like trying to run on glass. You do it anyway—slow, controlled, keeping your shoulder off the dense right-wall wire runs. Ten meters gets you to what you half-remember as a maintenance notch: a shallow recess where the wall steps in and the floor dips.

The “lowest, wettest bypass” is there—barely a bypass at all. A sagging strip of silt-skin over a narrow channel, darker and wetter than the rest, with a faint stink of foul manifold.

You smear mud across both your fronts—shirt, harness webbing, anything that could snag—and start across.

Your next hard step punches through.

The crust collapses with a soft *whump*, like a lung giving out. Your leg drops knee-deep into black, cold water threaded with rebar. Something catches your boot and yanks sideways. The backflow tugs like a hand, trying to pull you under the slab edge. Sewage gas burps up and burns your throat.

Your partner lurches as your grip on their harness turns into an anchor point—nearly dragging them down with you. They scramble, feet skittering, and slam a palm into the wall to keep upright.

At the same time, your shoving of debris into the center groove does what you wanted: it deadens the groove into a messy, dragging bed. But it also makes *your* retreat line worse—every movement now wants to slide toward the hole you just made.

And then the groove answers you with a new hazard: a thin, knee-high monofilament line you didn’t see—stretched across the groove at shin height, its anchor point visible under salt crust near the wall. As your body twists from the pull in the water, your free leg swings toward it.

If you clip that line, you hear a faint *click* from a recessed foul manifold—like a valve taking a breath.

Behind you, in the shaft direction, boots scrape closer—still on the riser, but descending toward the side cut. Someone coughs and spits.

“Hold—she’s in the wire lane,” a voice calls. “Listen for the tone shift.”

Right now: one leg trapped and being pulled by backflow; your partner teetering; and that tripline poised at your shin, ready to wake something in the foul recess if you hit it.

#### Turn 150 **[PLAYER]**

“Plant your feet—brace me on the wall. Do NOT move forward.”

I freeze my swinging leg short of the monofilament, then reach down and saw at whatever’s snagging my boot with the knife; if it won’t give in a second, I slice the boot laces/upper and abandon the boot, hauling my leg out and rolling left into the notch to keep clear of the tripline.

*Agent reasoning: I’m about to set off a tripline and get sucked into backflow; fastest is stabilize partner, avoid the line, cut my boot free if needed, and get out before the climbers arrive.*

#### Turn 151 **[GAME]**

Your partner plants their feet exactly where you tell them—back against the wall, knees bent, both hands on your harness strap like a belay. “I’ve got you,” they rasp, voice tight.

You lock your swinging leg in place. Your shin stops a finger’s width from the monofilament. It quivers from the air you displaced but doesn’t *sing* or snap—yet.

You bend down into the stink and jam the knife under the waterline, sawing at what’s got your boot. It’s not cloth or weed. The blade bites metal with a gritty scrape: a loop of rebar tie-wire or cable—thin but tough—cinched around the boot’s sole lug. The backflow keeps tension on it, making every cut fight you.

One second isn’t enough.

You make the call. Knife up, you slash the laces and cut into the softened upper. The boot gapes. Cold water rushes in. You wrench your foot out hard—skin on the heel tears a little, but the foot comes free.

Your partner hauls as you kick and roll left into the notch, keeping your legs low and away from the monofilament. You clear it cleanly.

Behind you, your abandoned boot stays in the hole for half a heartbeat… then the backflow takes it. It drags the boot under the slab edge and *pulls the snag line tight*.

From the recessed foul manifold you heard earlier: a distinct *click*, followed by a soft, building hiss—like a valve opening.

A thin sheet of water begins to pour from a seam in the recess, not a flood but a purposeful spill that starts to widen the collapse you just made. The crust at the edge sloughs away in slow bites.

Your partner stares at the spreading black water, then back at you. “What did you just trip?”

You didn’t touch the monofilament, but the boot and snag line effectively did something similar: they tensioned whatever was tied into that recess.

From the shaft-side passage, voices get closer—now in the crawl, not on the riser.

“Light low!” someone snaps. A beam sweeps, jittering off the groove walls. “There—movement. Don’t step the center.”

You’re in the notch with one boot on, one bare sock/foot, heel bleeding, and a bypass that’s actively getting wetter and less stable. The pursuers are seconds away from seeing the notch.

#### Turn 152 **[PLAYER]**

I clamp a hand over my partner’s mouth and hiss, “Shut up. Move.” Then I scoop a double handful of wet silt and fling it low into the center groove toward their sweeping beam to muddy their view, immediately dragging my partner deeper into the notch and into the wet bypass on the left. I keep my bleeding foot up on the wall as we slide through, and I shove more loose debris into the groove edge to help the new spill undercut and make the approach nasty for anyone chasing.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to spot us; I need an immediate break in line-of-sight and a route change. The valve spill can become a barrier—use it—then slip into the wet bypass despite the injury, and remove anything reflective that gives us away.*

I clamp a hand over my partner’s mouth. “Shut up.

As we slide through, I shove debris into the groove edge to help the spill undercut and make their approach a mess.

*Agent reasoning: We’ve got seconds before they spot the notch; fastest is blind them, commit to the left wet bypass, and make the approach collapse behind us.*

#### Turn 155 **[GAME]**

Your hand clamps over your partner’s mouth hard enough to stop the breathy noise. Their eyes flare, then they nod once—understanding—and go still.

You scoop silt and fling it low into the groove just as the beam sweeps past. It doesn’t “blind” the light, but it turns the air into a gritty shimmer and makes the beam break up into a dirty cone. The sweep hesitates.

“Dust—she’s close,” one of them says, and you hear boots stop short. Someone taps the wall with a hook-pole, testing.

You drag your partner deeper into the left notch and commit into the wet bypass. It’s narrower than it looked: a half-submerged side run where the wall bows inward and forces you sideways. You keep your bleeding foot high on the wall, toes flexed, trying not to let the torn heel touch the water.

It works—mostly. Your calf shakes from the strain, and you clip the water once with your heel. It stings like salt in a cut.

As you slide through, you shove loose debris toward the groove edge. The new spill from the recessed seam does the rest: water threads under the crust and starts chewing it from beneath. The edge you just left behind turns into a soft, collapsing lip. A chunk the size of a paving stone slumps away with a wet crack.

The pursuers reach the problem almost immediately.

“Hold—floor’s going,” the lead voice barks. A boot steps onto the undermined edge anyway; it drops ankle-deep with a splash and a curse. The hook-pole jabs down, finds nothing solid, and the man yanks it back fast.

“Bypass left,” someone else says, sure of it now. “She’s in the side run.”

A second beam snaps toward the notch mouth—low, searching. It catches the churned water and the fresh scrape marks where you hauled your partner in. They’re not guessing anymore.

Then the undercut you encouraged takes another bite. The seam-spill widens, and the bypass entrance starts to sag. Not a full collapse—yet—but the ceiling grit begins to rain down in steady peppering. Your partner flinches as small stones ping off their shoulder.

You’re moving, but the bypass is forcing you to go slow and sideways. Behind you, the entrance is becoming a collapsing choke point. In front, the bypass bends into darker water, and you can hear it: a low, continuous *gurgle* like it’s feeding into a larger drop.

“Get the snare line,” the lead voice orders. “No—don’t step it. Anchor and probe.”

They’re setting up to follow you in without triggering whatever you woke.

I lean to my partner’s ear. “No lights. Hold my belt. If I stop, you stop.” Then I push hard into the bend toward the gurgle, feeling for the lip of the drop with my booted foot and hand; if it’s a short fall, I slide us down it immediately, and if it’s a long one, I veer into any side seam or rung recess before the edge to avoid getting swept.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to probe in; I need distance fast and a hard obstacle. The gurgle sounds like a drop—use it to break line-of-sight and slow pursuit, even if it’s risky. Partner needs to stay quiet and close.*

You push into the bend. The bypass narrows again and the water deepens to mid-shin, moving with purpose now—pulling, not just sloshing. You keep your booted foot probing ahead, one palm sliding along the wall for any change in texture.

Your hand finds it first: the wall turns slick-smooth for a handspan, then drops away. A scoured lip. The gurgle is a vertical pull.

You ease your booted toe over the edge. Nothing solid within a quick step. Your foot meets falling water and open space. Long drop.

You jerk back and flatten to the wall, whispering “Stop.” Your partner freezes instantly, belt-hold tight enough to bruise.

You feel along the wall just upstream of the lip, searching for anything engineered—rungs, a seam, a maintenance notch. Your fingers catch a narrow vertical joint packed with old sealant, then—there—an inset rectangle: a recessed service pocket half a forearm wide, just above the waterline. Inside, two corroded ladder staples run down out of sight.

You shove your body into the pocket, shoulder first, and pull your partner in behind you. The water tries to peel you off the wall toward the drop; it tugs at your legs like hands.

You hook your booted foot onto the top staple. It holds—barely—creaking under your weight. Rust flakes into the water.

Behind you, from the collapsing choke point, voices carry sharper now, closer, echoing in the bypass.

“Line in!” someone barks. Metal scrapes on concrete. A rope hisses out through wet hands.

A flashlight beam stabs into the bend—brief, low—then snaps off again as ordered. But it was enough: it glints off the wet wall and catches the pale edge of your partner’s knuckles on your belt before darkness swallows it.

“There!” the same voice says, certain. Boots splash into the bypass. The rope goes taut as they anchor it.

Your immediate problem is the staples: they descend into darkness, but they’re rotten. If you go down fast, one could shear. If you stay, the current keeps trying to drag your legs into the drop—and the pursuers are now committed into the bypass behind you with a line and probes.

#### Turn 158 **[PLAYER]**

“On me—one rung at a time. Don’t hang, just step.” I drop my weight low, test the next staple with my booted foot, then descend fast but controlled, keeping three points of contact and spacing us so only one of us loads a rung at once. As soon as we’re a body-length down, I kick hard at the pocket edge to slough rust and grit and send it into the flow toward the lip, trying to make their probe/rope bite and pull them toward the drop.

*Agent reasoning: We’re about to get pinned at the lip; fastest escape is down the pocket. Reduce load on each staple and use the pursuers’ rope against them by forcing them into the current/drop.*

#### Turn 159 **[GAME]**

“One rung at a time. Don’t hang—just step.”

You drop low and test the next staple with your boot. It flexes—alive in the wrong way—but it doesn’t peel out. You commit, keeping your chest close to the wall, hands on the side edges of the pocket to take some load off the metal. Your partner mirrors you, knuckles white on the belt, waiting until you’re a full body-length down before they move.

The descent works—fast, controlled—until the third staple.

Your boot finds it, presses, and the staple *shifts* with a gritty pop. The concrete around it is honeycombed; seepage has been eating it from behind. You pull your weight back onto your hands and the higher rung, but the movement vibrates the pocket.

Above, the lip answers with a wet crack.

The pocket edge you just kicked at doesn’t just shed rust and grit—it sheds *structure*. A slab of undermined concrete breaks free at the bypass lip and drops into the black water with a heavy, muffled *whump*. The current surges as if it’s been given a wider mouth.

And it takes you with it.

The pull hits your legs first, yanking them out and down. Your hands scrape off the pocket edge. For half a second you’re suspended, then you and your partner drop into black water that tastes like pennies.

Something catches—hard. Rebar.

A hooked length snags your clothing near the hip; another rakes your bleeding foot and catches the torn edge of your boot. Your partner’s belt-hand jerks, and they slam into you, choking back a sound as the undertow drags both of you toward a dead-end sump where the water churns in place.

Up above, the pursuers shout as the floor goes.

“Back—BACK!” the lead voice roars.

A probe pole clatters. The rope line snaps taut and then slackens as whoever’s holding it stumbles away from the collapsing lip. The bypass entrance becomes a rain of grit and small stones; their footing is suddenly as bad as you hoped—worse.

But you’re in the worse place now: in the void below, pinned and being pulled.

You can feel three options in your hands and teeth-level panic:
- Tear free immediately by abandoning whatever’s snagged (it’s your hip cloth and your boot/foot).
- Grab the dangling cable bundle brushing your shoulder in the dark and haul up toward the pocket.
- Find the embedded ladder rungs you can feel along the wall—two of them wobble when you slap for purchase.

The undertow keeps dragging, steady as a winch, toward the sump.

#### Turn 160 **[PLAYER]**

I rasp, “Cut free—NOW,” and slash my snagged hip cloth off with the knife, then rip my foot out by abandoning the torn boot. I grab the dangling cable bundle with both hands and haul us up toward the pocket, keeping my partner tight on my belt and kicking for the wall to avoid the sump pull.

*Agent reasoning: Speed move: cut losses, get free fast. Boot is already compromised and snagged; abandoning it is quickest. Then use the cable bundle as a stable handhold to haul out before undertow pins us.*

#### Turn 161 **[GAME]**

“Cut free—NOW.”

You go for the snag at your hip—and your hand closes on nothing. No knife. Your inventory’s been empty since the start, and there’s no handle where your fingers expect it. The undertow doesn’t care about the mistake; it keeps hauling.

So you do it the hard way.

You wedge two fingers under the rebar hook that’s caught your hip cloth and wrench your body sideways until fabric starts to tear. The cloth rips in a long, ugly strip. Pain flares at your hip where the rebar scraped skin through the tear, but the hook lets go.

Your foot is worse. The torn boot is pinned by a bent rebar prong; when you yank, it bites into the raw heel. You clamp your jaw and twist your ankle until the boot peels off with a suctioning *pop*, leaving your sock and bare heel exposed. The rebar rakes you again on the way out—warmth blooms in the water around your foot.

Free—mostly. Bleeding, but free.

A cable bundle brushes your shoulder in the dark: old conduit guts, slick with algae slime, still anchored somewhere above. You grab it with both hands. It’s thicker than you hoped and it *moves* under load—stretching, not breaking. You haul, hand-over-hand, and your partner stays locked to your belt, kicking at the wall to keep both of you from being spun into the sump’s pull.

The cable creaks against a bracket. Your shoulders burn. The current tries to peel you off like a label.

You gain about a body-length—enough that your head breaks into a pocket of trapped air under a low ledge. You can breathe, but it’s stale and tastes like wet copper. Your partner’s face surfaces beside yours, gasping silently, eyes huge.

Above, in the bypass, someone yells, closer than you want: “Hear that? Below!”

A pole tip clanks against concrete, probing for an edge. A flashlight snaps on for a second—its beam knifes down through the collapse dust and catches the cable you’re hanging from, vibrating.

They’ve got your line now: the cable is a tell.

The cable holds for the moment, but it’s not a ladder—every pull makes the bracket complain, and the undertow is still feeding the sump. Your bare, bleeding heel keeps slipping when you try to find wall purchase.

**Outcome:** you successfully tore free of the rebar snags and got you and your partner up into a small air pocket under a ledge by hauling the cable; you lost your boot and you’re bleeding from hip and heel; the pursuers have detected you below and are probing the drop.

I hiss to my partner, “Quiet. Stay on my belt.” Then I jerk the cable hard sideways to try to rip it free or snap it so it stops advertising us, and I feel along the ledge for a lateral seam/pipe mouth—anything that runs away from the drop—then pull us into it immediately, keeping my bleeding foot tucked up and off the current.

*Agent reasoning: They’ve spotted the cable; staying here gets us pinned. Fastest is to ditch the tell, move laterally into any culvert/maintenance seam from the air pocket, and keep my partner quiet and close.*

I press my mouth to my partner’s ear. “Quiet. Stay on my belt.” I wrench the cable hard sideways to try to snap it free, then immediately sweep my hands along the ledge for a lateral seam or pipe mouth and shove us into the first opening that runs away from the drop, keeping my bleeding foot tucked up out of the current.

*Agent reasoning: The cable is giving away our position and the air pocket is a dead end if they start probing; fastest is to break line-of-sight and move laterally into any side run.*

#### Turn 165 **[GAME]**

You press in close, lips at your partner’s ear. “Quiet. Stay on my belt.” They nod once—tiny, rigid—then clamp their jaw shut so hard you feel it through the strap.

You wrench the cable sideways.

For a heartbeat it feels like it might go—then the bracket above answers with a sharp *tink* and the whole bundle snaps taut like a live thing. The cable doesn’t break. Instead, the anchor point *shifts*, metal grinding on concrete, and the cable whips back and slaps the water. The vibration runs straight up the line.

Above you, a voice barks: “There—line moved!”

A hook-pole tip drops into the void and catches the cable. It *tugs*, testing. Not hauling yet—feeling you.

You don’t wait. You sweep the underside of the ledge with both hands. Concrete, slime, a jagged seam… then your fingers find a round mouth: a service pipe cut short, maybe a meter wide, its edge sharp with rust scale. It runs laterally—away from the drop.

You shove your shoulder into it and pull your partner after you by the belt. Your bleeding foot stays tucked, knee high, to keep the current from grabbing you again. The pipe’s lip scrapes your hip raw where the cloth tore; your partner stifles a gasp as their ribs grind the rim.

Inside, the water is shallower—still moving, but less violent. The undertow’s pull drops from a winch to a hand on your ankle.

Behind you, the cable jerks again—harder. The hook-pole man commits. “Got it! Something’s on—”

The bracket above finally gives up with a concrete *crack*. The cable tears free in a shower of grit and drops into the void, the hooked pole skittering and clanging as the man loses leverage.

“Shit—BACK!” someone yells, and boots scrape away from the collapsing edge.

Outcome: you successfully found a lateral pipe and got both of you into it; the cable didn’t snap at first—your wrenching signaled your position and prompted a hook-pole grab—but their tugging finished the job by ripping the bracket free, dropping the line and forcing them back from the lip.

In the pipe, you have maybe a few body-lengths of cover before it narrows or bends. You’re still bleeding, barefoot on one side, and the pipe air is thin and sour—but you’re no longer directly under the drop.

#### Turn 166 **[PLAYER]**

I yank us deeper into the lateral pipe at a crouch, pushing for the first bend or junction. “No talking—count your breaths,” I whisper, then feel the wall for any maintenance hatch/valve recess we can duck into if they start probing the mouth.

*Agent reasoning: We bought a few seconds and broke their “line,” so the fastest win is to put distance and a bend between us and the drop, then deal with bleeding only if it’s disabling.*

#### Turn 167 **[GAME]**

You pull the belt and your partner stumbles after you, both of you half-crouched in the pipe. The ceiling is low enough that your back scrapes rust nodules. The water here is shin-deep, sliding fast but not trying to steal you.

“No talking—count your breaths,” you whisper. Your partner’s shoulders bob once in agreement. You can hear them doing it: inhale, hold, exhale—too quick at first, then slowing as your pace forces a rhythm.

You push for distance. The pipe runs straight for about ten meters, then takes a hard left bend. Before the bend, your fingertips find a recessed rectangle in the right wall: an old access niche with a corroded quarter-turn valve and a bolted plate beneath it. The plate isn’t flush—one bolt head is missing, another is rounded off, and there’s a hairline gap you can get nails into. It’s not a “duck in and disappear” hatch, but it’s a place to press bodies into shadow if light comes down the mouth.

Behind you, from the direction of the drop, sound carries cleanly through the pipe: metal scraping concrete, then a voice, closer again.

“Pole’s in—sweep it! Don’t lean the lip!”

The hook-pole clacks against the pipe mouth. Then, a new sound: thin chain rattling, as if they’re lowering something with weight to keep it from drifting—maybe the pole, maybe a line.

A flashlight beam doesn’t reach you yet, but you see its flicker reflect off the wet curve of the pipe at the far end of the straightaway, pulsing as someone tries to angle it in.

Outcome: you got deeper to the first bend and found a valve recess/access niche you can use for partial cover; the pursuers are now actively probing the pipe mouth with a pole/line and trying to get light into the run. The threat is immediate detection if they get the beam past the bend or hook something inside the pipe.

I shove my partner into the valve recess niche, flattening us into shadow for two breaths, then tug them forward and hustle us around the left bend. If the beam starts to reach, I slap a wet handprint smear across the pipe at the corner to dull reflections and keep moving without stopping.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to sweep light and a pole down the straight; best move is break line-of-sight and buy time by getting past the bend, using the niche only if we can’t make it.*

#### Turn 169 **[GAME]**

You shove your partner into the valve recess niche and press in with them—two bodies forced into a space meant for one set of hands. Rust flakes bite your cheek. Your partner’s breath catches once; you clamp a palm over their sternum through cloth to steady the rise-and-fall. Two breaths. In. Out. In. Out.

The probing at the pipe mouth gets louder: hook-pole tip *tink-tink* on metal, then a wet scrape as it drags along the pipe’s bottom, testing for feet, belts, anything to snag.

A flashlight beam stabs down the straight run. It doesn’t hit you directly, but it *does* glance off the water skin and the pipe’s wet curve, sending a pale wash that creeps toward the bend.

You pull your partner out of the niche and hustle them forward. Around the left bend, you slap your wet hand against the corner and smear hard—algae, soot, and silt streaking into a dull matte. The next pulse of light hits that smeared patch and dies instead of blooming into a bright reflection.

You keep moving without stopping.

Around the bend, the pipe drops a few centimeters and the flow quickens; it tugs at your ankles, trying to pull you deeper. Your tucked, bleeding foot stays out of the current, but the hop-step makes you slower and louder. Your partner grips your belt with both hands now, knuckles white.

Behind you, the hook-pole clacks again—closer than you want. Then a voice, irritated, echoing down the pipe:

“Light’s not carrying—something’s on the corner. Get the chain in. Feel for the bend.”

Chain rattles, then a heavier *plunk* as they lower a weighted line into the mouth to drag and “read” the pipe.

Outcome: you successfully used the niche for a brief hide and got around the bend; your smear noticeably reduced the flashlight’s reach past the corner. Consequence: they’ve switched tactics—probing with a weighted chain/line that can snake around the bend and potentially snag you if you don’t open distance fast.

I grab my partner’s wrist and haul them into a jog-splash, pushing for any junction, grate, or vertical ladder stub—anything that breaks the pipe’s straight path. “When the chain hits, drop flat and let it slide over—don’t grab it,” I hiss, then keep moving hard to open distance before it rounds the bend.

I clamp my hand around my partner’s wrist and haul them into a jog-splash, driving forward for any junction, grate, or ladder stub. “When the chain hits, drop flat and let it slide over—don’t grab it,” I hiss, and keep pushing hard to open distance before it rounds the bend.

*Agent reasoning: The chain probe will round the bend and snag us if we stay in a straight run; best speed is to open distance and find a junction/ladder/grate to change levels or break line-of-probe, while prepping my partner not to panic-grab the chain.*

#### Turn 173 **[GAME]**

You clamp your hand on your partner’s wrist and drag them into a sloppy jog. Water slaps loud against the pipe walls; every step throws a bright little sound that carries.

The pipe stays tight and featureless for another stretch—no grate, no side takeoff—just a slight wobble in the seam where two sections were welded decades apart. Then the floor pitches down a touch and the flow accelerates. Your partner nearly goes to a knee; you keep them up by the wrist and belt.

Ahead, the pipe finally breaks its monotony: a low, rectangular service throat on the right, half blocked by a bent grille. It’s not a full manway—more like a cable/inspection takeoff—but it’s a hard edge and a change in geometry. Past it, the main pipe continues and you can hear a different sound layered under the water: a hollow, vertical “breathing” draft, like air moving in a shaft.

Behind you, the chain arrives.

Not the weight first—the *feel* of it: a metallic rasping that suddenly becomes loud as it scrapes around the bend. The first links skitter along the pipe bottom, then hop as the weight bumps the corner and swings through. It’s moving fast, dragged from behind with intent.

Your warning lands just in time. Your partner drops flat in panic—too slow by a fraction. The chain slides over their back, but one link catches on their pack strap or belt loop and yanks hard. They make a sharp, involuntary sound.

Down the pipe, a voice barks, immediate and satisfied: “Got something! Haul!”

The chain goes taut. Your partner is now being pulled backward along the slick pipe floor toward the bend, heels scraping, water spraying. You’re still holding their wrist, and the pull transmits into your shoulder—if you keep your grip, you’ll be dragged too.

The service throat with the bent grille is three to four body-lengths ahead on your right. The vertical draft sound is beyond that, further down the main run.

Threat is clear: the pursuers have hooked your partner with the chain and are actively hauling; if you don’t break the snag or change the geometry fast, they’ll reel you back to the bend and into their reach.

“Knife it off—NOW!” I bark, yanking them toward the right-side service throat and ramming their caught strap/hip against the bent grille to try to snag the chain on the metal and peel it free, then shove them headfirst into the throat and follow in tight.

*Agent reasoning: Fastest way is break the snag and change direction into the side throat; if I get dragged, we’re done. I’ll use the bent grille as a hard edge to shear the chain off their strap.*

#### Turn 175 **[GAME]**

Your shout is useless on the “knife it off” part—neither of you has a blade. But the rest of the move is pure engineer’s spite: use the geometry.

You yank them sideways toward the right-side service throat and slam their hip/strap hard into the bent grille. The chain, already under tension, bites into the grille’s deformed bars with a shriek of metal. For a half-second it holds—then you drive again, grinding the caught link deeper into the kinked steel.

The pull from behind spikes. Your partner’s whole body jerks backward; your grip on their wrist nearly tears free. The grille flexes, protesting, and then one of its corroded fasteners gives with a sharp *ping*. The grille twists just enough to trap the chain link like a hook in a fish’s mouth.

Outcome: the chain is no longer pulling your partner cleanly—it’s snagged on the grille.

Consequence: the pursuers feel the change immediately.

From behind: “It hung—keep hauling! Don’t let it slack!”

The chain goes taut-tighter. The grille starts to peel out of its seat, screeching as rusted metal tears. If it rips free entirely, it’ll come with the chain… and you and your partner are right on top of it.

You don’t wait. You shove your partner headfirst into the service throat. It’s a brutal squeeze: shoulders scraping, cables brushing their face, the inside stinking of old insulation and stagnant air. You follow in tight, twisting sideways to fit.

As you disappear into the throat, the main pipe behind you erupts with a tearing sound—metal giving way under the haul. The grille lurches, half-detached, still holding the chain link… for now. The opening you’re in is narrow enough that a body can’t rush it at speed, but a hooked pole or the chain itself can still be fed into it.

You are both in the right-side service throat, wedged among cable runs, with the chain snag-point at the mouth actively being ripped apart by force from the far side.

I shove my partner deeper down the throat toward that draft, then rip at the nearest loose cable bundle and wad it into the mouth behind us as a snag/jam. “Keep crawling—don’t look back,” I hiss, and shoulder-forward crawl hard until we hit a turn or a vertical stub.

*Agent reasoning: We need to break line-of-pull fast before they rip the grille and feed the chain into this throat; push deeper to a vertical/turn and use the cable run as an improvised jam if needed.*

#### Turn 177 **[GAME]**

You shove your partner deeper into the throat. The draft is real in here—cooler, less wet—pulling along the cable run like a slow inhale. The space stays miserably tight: elbows in silt, cheek against gritty concrete, cables brushing your ear like drowned vines.

You grab the nearest slack bundle—old comms line and a thicker, tar-stiff power lead—and rip. The outer sheath tears with a dull *pop*, copper strands flashing. You wad the whole mess into the mouth behind you, jamming it between the throat lip and the half-torn grille.

It works—briefly.

The next haul from behind turns the jam into a winch. The cable bundle cinches hard, biting into the grille and the throat edge. You hear insulation squeal, then a sharp crack as a conductor snaps. A shower of tiny blue-white sparks spits in the pipe mouth, hissing where they hit wet metal. The smell of burnt plastic floods the throat.

Your partner flinches but keeps crawling when you hiss at them. You shoulder-forward after them, pushing through the constriction until the throat kinks left around a concrete rib. Past the bend, the draft strengthens and the sound changes: not water anymore—open air space somewhere ahead.

Behind you, the pursuers reach the mouth. A voice, close now, distorted by the pipe: “They’re in the takeoff—feed the hook in!”

Something metallic clacks against the throat lip. A hooked pole probes in, scraping. It catches your cable wad and yanks; the jam holds for a second, then starts to unravel under steady pulling.

You hit the bend and gain a few body-lengths of concealment, but the threat is immediate and specific: a hook-pole is being worked into the throat to snag ankles or packs, and your improvised cable jam is failing under tension and tearing live conductors that are now intermittently sparking at the mouth.

Just past the bend, as your light smears across the wall, you see a faded municipal stencil under algae bloom—your old department code, half-obscured—tagging a narrow, dry belly-crawl that rises above the cable run. It skirts away from the throat’s main line, toward that cleaner air draft.

“Bypass—up, now.” I shove my partner into the dry belly-crawl first, then wriggle in after them, kicking a last loop of slack cable down behind us to foul the hook and crawling hard toward the stronger draft.

*Agent reasoning: They’re probing with a hook and my cable jam won’t last; the bypass is higher/drier and likely too tight for them to follow quickly. Fastest is to get us into that belly-crawl and keep moving toward air.*

#### Turn 179 **[GAME]**

You ram your partner upward into the dry belly-crawl bypass. The angle is just steep enough that you have to commit—knees and elbows scraping on gritty concrete that hasn’t seen standing water in a long time. The air immediately shifts: cooler, cleaner, with that telltale “leaking” freshness that doesn’t belong down here.

You wriggle in after them and, as you go, you hook a boot on a slack loop of cable and kick it down into the throat below.

Outcome: the loop drops right onto the probing hook-pole tip as it snakes around the bend. You hear a satisfying *clank* and then a sharp jerk as the pole catches cable instead of flesh.

A man grunts—close, frustrated. “It’s fouled—pull it back!”

They tug. The cable loop tightens around the hook’s crook and cinches. For a second, you’ve bought friction and confusion.

Consequence: they don’t stop. They change tactics.

“Then cut the damned cable,” another voice says, and you hear wet boots repositioning, metal scraping as someone braces in the main pipe. Something hard strikes—maybe a chisel or the butt of a tool—followed by a snapping twang as copper strands give way. The fouled loop starts to slide free.

You and your partner crawl hard. The bypass narrows to a true belly-squeeze: ribs dragging, breath loud in your own ears. Ahead, the draft strengthens into a steady pull, and with it comes a thin, high hum—live infrastructure nearby, not just open air. Your partner’s breathing turns ragged, but they keep moving.

After about two body-lengths, the bypass reaches a short vertical stub—an old service riser throat with dry rungs set into the concrete. Above it: a hatch outline, newer bolts catching your light, and at the seam a faint feather of *clean air* leaking down like a promise.

Below and behind, the hook-pole scrapes again—closer now, no longer fouled. They’re feeding it into the bypass entrance and working it upward, trying to snag a leg at the riser.

Threat is immediate: you’re at a vertical riser with a bolted hatch above; pursuers are actively probing into the bypass with a hook-pole and closing the distance.

#### Turn 180 **[PLAYER]**

“Up the rungs—move!” I boost my partner into the riser, then climb right after, planting a boot on the top rung to keep low. I slam my heel down toward the shaft mouth to kick the hook back if it reaches, then start wrenching at the hatch bolts with my hands, feeling for anything already loose.

*Agent reasoning: Fastest exit is the hatch; we can’t fight a hook-pole in a crawlspace. Get partner up first, then I’ll block the riser and force entry.*

#### Turn 181 **[GAME]**

You boost your partner into the riser. They get both hands on the dry rungs and climb fast, boots scraping concrete. You follow immediately, keeping low under them, one knee jammed against the wall for leverage.

The hook arrives a heartbeat later. You hear it before you see it—metal on concrete, a deliberate scrape—then the curved tip snakes up into the riser mouth, fishing.

You slam your heel down.

Outcome: you connect. Your boot catches the hook’s crook and drives it back out of the riser with a hollow *clang*. The pole whips away and bangs the throat wall below. Someone curses—short and sharp.

Consequence: they don’t give you space; they change the angle. The pole comes back, higher, thrusting rather than probing, trying to wedge past your boot and pin your ankle against the rung.

Above, you reach the hatch. Up close, it’s worse than you hoped: new bolts, hex heads, seated in fresh sealant that still looks slightly glossy in your light. Your fingers find no looseness—everything is torqued down. You manage to peel a thin ribbon of sealant with your nails, but the bolt itself doesn’t budge.

A voice echoes up the riser now, right under you: “They’re on the hatch—hold ‘em! Get the chain up here!”

Metal rattles below—someone feeding something heavy into the throat. The hook-pole jabs again, and this time the tip catches the underside of the lowest rung and levers, trying to lift your boot off its brace point.

Your partner reaches the hatch seam and sucks in the clean air leaking through, then looks down at you—eyes wide, waiting for it to give.

Threat is immediate and specific: the hatch is sealed with new hardware you can’t loosen by hand, and the pursuers are preparing to bring the chain up to the riser while the hook-pole works to dislodge your brace and snag you or your partner’s legs. If they get the chain into the riser, they can haul you down or pin you against the shaft wall.

#### Turn 182 **[PLAYER]**

“Stomp the hatch edge—hard—like you mean to cave it in!” I bark up at my partner, then wedge my boot and shin across the rung to pin the hook-pole in the throat. With my free hand I yank another loose cable loop and drop it straight down the riser to snare the chain when it comes, then drive my shoulder up into the hatch from below, trying to pop the seal.

*Agent reasoning: Bolts won’t hand-turn; fastest is brute force—use body weight to shear seal/strip bolts or pop the hatch. Also need to deny the riser: if chain comes up, we’re done. I’ll have partner stomp/pry from above while I jam the hook and drop something to foul the shaft.*

#### Turn 183 **[GAME]**

Your partner plants both boots on the hatch edge and stomps—once, twice—hard enough to make the riser ring like a bell. The hatch doesn’t cave, but the sealant at one corner spider-cracks with a dry *tick*, and a stronger tongue of clean air pushes through the seam.

Below, you wedge your boot and shin across the rung and catch the hook-pole on the upswing. Outcome: you pin it for a moment—metal trapped between your shin and the rung. The man on the other end yanks, but all he gets is a grinding squeal and a jolt that runs up your leg.

Consequence: the leverage is brutal. The hook’s crook bites and slips; it scrapes your boot sole and then skates across your shin. Pain flares hot and immediate—skin torn through whatever thin fabric you’ve got left. You keep it from getting past, but you can’t hold it there without paying for it.

You reach one-handed and rip a loose cable loop from the wall run—stiff, half-cured with tar—and drop it straight down the riser.

It falls right into the darkness as the chain arrives.

A heavy length of chain clatters up from below, fed by unseen hands. The cable loop catches it—partly. Outcome: the chain snags, twists, and momentarily binds against the riser wall with the cable loop wrapped around a link. It slows their feed and turns their pull into a jerky, inefficient tug.

“Caught—something caught!” someone barks under you. “Cut it—CUT IT!”

You drive your shoulder up into the hatch from below, timing it with your partner’s stomps. The corner with the cracked sealant gives a fraction—enough that a thin line of light appears at the seam, a pale blade. The hatch shifts maybe a finger-width, then stops dead against the bolts. Your shoulder impact buys you *movement* but not an opening.

Above, your partner’s hands find the gap and pry—fingertips whitening—trying to peel the hatch up against the bolt tension. Their breath is loud in the confined shaft.

Below, the chain jerks again, harder. The cable loop starts to saw against a link; you hear strands popping one by one. The hook-pole—freed from your pin by sheer force—stabs upward again, now aiming for your ankle joint where your boot meets the rung.

Threat, clear: you’ve cracked the seal and shifted the hatch slightly, but it’s still locked by new bolts. The pursuers are cutting or tearing through your cable snare and are about to get a chain properly into the riser; the hook-pole is actively trying to snag your ankle to pull you down or hold you in place while they haul.

#### Turn 184 **[PLAYER]**

I snap my knee up to dodge the hook, then stomp straight down on the hook tip to pin it and shove it sideways off the rung. “Stop prying—LISTEN: feel the seam, find the corner that cracked—drive your fingers in and HOLD it open!” I jam two fingers into the cracked corner seam myself and saw them along to widen it, then yell down the shaft, “Got a cutter? You cut that cable, I cut your throat!”

*Agent reasoning: Hatch won’t open without tools; fastest is to force a gap big enough for fingers/air, then jam it so it can’t reseat while we shift to another exit path. Also need to stop the hook from catching my ankle right now.*

#### Turn 185 **[GAME]**

You snap your knee up as the hook darts for your ankle. The tip whistles past the rung edge and nicks nothing but air.

You stomp straight down on it—hard. Outcome: you pin the hook tip against the concrete lip of the riser mouth and grind it sideways. The pole flexes; the man below loses control for a beat. The hook scrapes off the rung edge and drops, clanging down the throat.

“—Shit!” the hook-man barks, and you hear him stumble back a step in the wet below.

Your partner stops prying blindly and does what you said: they find the corner where the sealant cracked. They jam fingers in and *hold*—white knuckles, wrists trembling. The hatch seam opens another sliver under their grip. Clean air pours harder now, cold and pressurized enough to make the hair on your forearms lift.

You jam two fingers into the cracked corner yourself and saw them along the seam.

Outcome: the sealant peels and tears in a ragged strip. Your fingers come back slick—part sealant, part blood where the hatch edge bites. The gap widens to maybe two finger-widths along a short run.

Consequence: the hatch still doesn’t lift. The bolts are still doing their job. What you’ve made is a *vent* and a *purchase point*, not an exit.

Your threat down the shaft—“Got a cutter?”—gets an immediate answer, not the one you want.

A voice below, calm and close: “You don’t have a throat to cut from up there.”

Then: a harsh metallic *snip-snip* as someone starts cutting at the cable loop binding the chain. The chain feed resumes, link by link, scraping up concrete. You feel the vibration through the rungs as it climbs.

Worse: they change the hook’s role. Instead of fishing for your ankle, the hook-man starts hammering the pole upward like a battering ram, striking the riser wall and rungs to rattle you loose while the chain comes up to grab.

Threat is now twofold and immediate:
1) The chain is coming up fast—once they get a loop over a rung or around a leg, they can haul you down or pin you in place.
2) The hatch seam is open only a couple finger-widths—enough for air and fingers, not enough for a body—and the sharp edge is already cutting you as you work it.

#### Turn 186 **[PLAYER]**

“Brace—don’t let that seam close.” I climb down one rung, wrap my forearm through a rung, and stomp/kick the rising chain to knock it off-line and jam it between rung and wall; then I yank the hook-pole up as it strikes, trying to steal it and wedge it crosswise in the shaft as a blocker. “Which side’s hinged?” I snap to my partner, “Find the hinge—tear the seal there!”

*Agent reasoning: Hatch won’t open by force; bolts are the lock. Fastest is to disable the chain and buy seconds by dropping weight, then use the cracked seam as a guide to find a latch/bolt access or hinge side; if no tool, use the chain itself as a lever/trip.*

#### Turn 187 **[GAME]**

“Brace—don’t let that seam close.” Your partner locks both hands in the cracked corner and leans their weight into it, forearms shaking. The seam stays open—barely—clean air hissing past their fingers.

You drop one rung, hook your forearm through the rung to anchor yourself, and kick at the chain as it rises.

Outcome: your boot catches the chain on an upswing and knocks it off-line. It slaps hard into the riser wall and rides up crooked. For a second it *does* start to wedge between rung and concrete.

Consequence: chain doesn’t behave like cable. The next pull from below yanks it tight; it bites, then slips. It rips past your boot and smashes your shin on the way by—painful, immediate, and it steals your balance for a heartbeat. The chain keeps coming.

The hook-pole starts hammering upward again. You time it and grab—yanking as it strikes.

Outcome: you get hands on the pole and haul it up a foot, maybe two, before the man below throws his weight into it. The pole jerks, twists, and the hook end whips inside the shaft. It doesn’t come free.

Consequence: the hook catches your forearm that’s threaded through the rung—just a glancing snag, but enough to rake skin and pin you awkwardly for a moment. You wrench away, but you’ve just shown them exactly where to aim.

Below, someone barks, “Chain’s up—get it over his arm!”

The chain rises to your level, and a loop swings toward the rung where your forearm is anchored. They’re trying to lasso the rung and cinch you in place.

Up top you snap, “Which side’s hinged?”

Your partner shifts their head, feeling along the seam with fingertips. “Right—hinge right!” they gasp, then immediately start tearing at the sealant along that side. They manage to peel another short strip, widening the gap along the hinge edge—but the hinge itself holds firm, metal-on-metal.

Immediate threat: the chain is now at your rung height and they’re actively trying to get a loop over the rung/your trapped forearm to cinch and haul you down. The hook-pole is still being driven upward, now targeting your anchor point. The hatch is *not* opening yet—only the seal is failing along the hinge side.

#### Turn 188 **[PLAYER]**

I yank my forearm out of the rung and climb up a half-step, then hook the chain loop with my boot and whip it sideways to catch on a rung and wedge. “Now—lift on the LEFT, not the hinge—use the gap and shove!” I slam my shoulder up under the left edge while they hold the seam open.

*Agent reasoning: I’m about to get lassoed; fastest is to free my arm and redirect the chain to jam it, buying seconds for the hatch to pop on the non-hinge side.*

#### Turn 189 **[GAME]**

You rip your forearm free of the rung—skin tears where the hook grazed you, but you’re loose—and climb up half a step, getting your weight higher.

The chain loop swings up again. You catch it with the inside edge of your boot and whip it sideways.

Outcome: the loop snaps across and *does* catch on a rung—half a wrap—then wedges between the rung and the wall for a heartbeat. The pull from below goes from smooth to a hard, choking *jerk*.

Consequence: the chain doesn’t stop; it loads. The rung you used becomes the fulcrum. Concrete dust spits from the wall where the chain bites. Your boot gets yanked with it—your ankle torques painfully, and you have to tear your foot free before it gets trapped between chain and rung. The chain grinds, then pops free with a metallic shriek and continues upward.

You shout, “Now—lift on the LEFT, not the hinge—use the gap and shove!”

Your partner shifts their grip to the left edge, fingers jammed into the ragged seam, and heaves. You slam your shoulder up under the left edge at the same time.

Outcome: the hatch lifts—just enough to *clack* against bolt shanks. You gain a narrow crescent opening on the left side, maybe the width of two knuckles at its widest point. Clean air gushes out in a steady stream, strong enough to flutter loose grit down the shaft.

Consequence: the bolts are still seated. You’ve turned the hatch into a partially lifted, bolt-stopped lid—an opening that can take fingers, maybe a thin tool, but not a head or shoulder. And forcing it like this makes noise: the bolt metal squeals against the hatch plate, loud and sharp.

Below, the response is immediate and practical. The calm voice barks, “They’ve got purchase—CUT THE BOLTS.”

You hear splashing footsteps reposition. Then a new sound joins the chain’s scrape: a battery grinder or saw waking up—high, angry whine—somewhere just below the riser mouth, angled up toward the bolts you can’t see from beneath.

The chain keeps climbing too, now used as a stabilizer: they’re feeding it up to brace whoever’s bringing the cutter into position.

Threat, clear: you’ve created a small opening but not an exit; the pursuers are about to put a cutter on the bolts from below. If they cut the wrong thing (or deliberately cut the hatch edge), the hatch can drop or shift suddenly—your partner’s fingers are in the seam, and your shoulder is under the left edge. If the cutter bites metal near you, you’re one slip away from losing fingers or taking the full hatch edge to the neck/shoulder.

#### Turn 190 **[PLAYER]**

“Fingers OUT—let it drop!” I pull my shoulder back and let the hatch slam down onto the bolts, then jam my boot against the seam to keep a hairline gap. I snake my hand up through the crescent opening and feel for the bolt heads/backs—anything I can spin, shear, or yank loose from the top side—while barking down the shaft, “Cut it and you’ll wear this hatch!”

*Agent reasoning: Grinder means we’re out of time; we need to deny them line-of-sight to the bolts and convert this gap into an exit fast. Best play: drop the hatch to protect fingers, then use the gap to slip a tool/hand through and release from above or get into the space beyond.*

#### Turn 191 **[GAME]**

“Fingers OUT—let it drop!”

Your partner yanks their hands clear just in time. You pull your shoulder back and the hatch drops—*clang*—onto the bolt shanks. The impact stings your ears and sends a puff of clean, cold air down the riser like a breath forced through teeth.

You jam your boot against the seam, not to hold it open—just to keep it from sealing flush. You get a hairline gap: enough to keep air leaking, not enough to see through.

You snake your hand up through the crescent opening you’d made earlier—only now it’s mostly gone. Your fingers find the underside of the hatch plate and the bolt ends: smooth, round shanks with very little to grab. These aren’t old hex heads you can spin; they feel like carriage bolts or security bolts—domed on top, with the nut side likely *above* the hatch in whatever clean space is feeding that air.

You probe, frantic and precise: you do find one thing—wire. A short length of thin steel safety wire or tie, looped through a tab near one bolt, probably meant to keep something from vibrating loose. You can hook it with a finger and pull it taut, but it won’t shear by hand.

Below, your bark gets an answer—snarled laughter and then a hard, practical repositioning.

“Back off the mouth!” someone shouts. The grinder whine shifts angle, farther down the shaft—safer from the hatch’s drop line. They’re not cutting blind at the seam anymore.

Then the chain changes purpose again: instead of rising, it goes taut and *stops*, braced. A second later the hook-pole slams upward—not at your ankle now, but at the hatch edge itself. They’re trying to rattle your boot out of the seam and force the hatch to sit flush so you lose even that hairline gap and any reach.

You feel the hatch shudder with each strike. Your boot vibrates against metal; if it slips, the seam closes and your hand is trapped against a domed bolt end with nowhere to withdraw fast.

And under all of it—subtle but real—you catch movement off to the side in a flooded culvert slit: a snorkel mask lens glints once, then disappears. Water ripples where someone quietly shifts position.

Threats now:
- Hook-pole impacts can knock your boot free and slam the hatch shut on your hand.
- The grinder is repositioning for a safer cut—likely the chain, or the hinge, or something that makes the hatch fail in a way you can’t control.
- Someone nearby is tracking the situation from cover, close enough to report or intervene.

#### Turn 192 **[PLAYER]**

I yank my hand back fast and pull my boot off the seam before the next shudder can bite. I hiss to my partner, “Down—culvert slit, now,” then pivot and drop toward the flooded side channel, calling low, “Hey—mask. You want to live, point me to the nearest bypass out of here.”

*Agent reasoning: I can’t win a bolt-cutting contest from below. Fastest path is disengage, use the culvert watcher as a new variable—either ally or exit—and avoid getting my hand trapped.*

#### Turn 193 **[GAME]**

You rip your hand back in time—your knuckles scrape the bolt ends but nothing catches. You pull your boot off the seam.

The hatch slams fully flush on the next hook-pole strike. The clean-air hiss stops like someone pinched a tube. Your partner, hearing you, doesn’t argue—just drops a rung hard, then another, boots clanging as they go.

You pivot and drop toward the flooded side channel.

Outcome: you make the drop, but it’s ugly. Your wet boot sole skates on slime at the lip; you catch yourself with one hand on a corroded ladder staple and swing down into thigh-deep water with a splash you can’t hide.

Consequence: something tugs your leg immediately—loose cable or rebar snag under the surface. It doesn’t hold you fast, but it steals a second as you wrench free, and that second is loud.

You call low, “Hey—mask. You want to live, point me to the nearest bypass out of here.”

The glint you saw resolves: a diver’s mask just above the waterline in the culvert slit. Not one of the hook-pole crew—this one’s been waiting. A Tidewarden-style rig: dark hood, compact tank, quiet breathing.

They don’t answer your bargain. They act.

A hand flicks out of the slit and a thin line snakes across the water—weighted. It hits and starts to sink toward your shins, aiming to foul your legs.

At the same moment, above you in the riser, the chain goes slack—then drops. Not free-falling; fed fast. It splashes into the channel behind you, cutting off the path back under the shaft like a metal curtain.

From the shaft mouth, the pursuit leader shouts down: “There. Cornered. Don’t spear—take her breathing.”

Your partner hits the water a beat later, splashing into the channel on your left. They see the line and immediately jerk back, but the weighted cord is already drifting toward both of you with the current.

Clear threats:
- The masked diver is actively trying to entangle your legs with a weighted line from the culvert slit.
- The chain is being used to block the route back and to pen you in the side channel.
- The team above is closing for a non-lethal capture; you can hear them moving along the rim and preparing to come down.

#### Turn 194 **[PLAYER]**

I slash down through the water with my knife at the weighted line as it sinks, then grab the weight and fling it back toward the slit to foul the diver instead. “Go—over the chain, left wall!” I hiss to my partner, and I lunge into the culvert slit right after the thrown weight, shoulder-first, trying to jam the diver in place and force a passage past them.

*Agent reasoning: Entanglement is the immediate kill/capture condition; cut/avoid the line first, then take the only forward exit—the culvert slit—before the team climbs down.*

#### Turn 195 **[GAME]**

Your knife comes out low and fast, slashing down through the murk where the line is sinking.

Outcome: you hit *something*—the cord twangs and goes slack in your hand. The cut isn’t clean; it’s a frayed break, but it’s broken enough that the weight stops tracking your legs.

You grab the weight—cold metal, oblong—and whip it back toward the culvert slit.

Outcome: the throw lands. It smacks the concrete lip with a sharp *clack* and drops into the slit’s mouth, dragging a tail of line after it.

Consequence: it doesn’t “foul” the diver neatly. The diver’s hand darts out and *catches the line*, using it like a handle. You’ve given them something to pull with.

“Go—over the chain, left wall!” you hiss.

Your partner moves—fast, ugly scramble—hands on the left wall, trying to get around the hanging chain curtain where it’s splashing and bouncing in the channel. They get a shoulder over it, then a hip, water slapping loud.

You lunge shoulder-first into the culvert slit right behind the weight.

Outcome: you collide with the diver hard. Your shoulder hits their chest/rig; their mask knocks the wall with a plastic crack. For a half second you have them pinned in the narrow throat.

Immediate consequence: they *don’t* let go. They cinch the remaining line around your forearm with a practiced twist and shove back with their fins braced deeper in the slit. The space is too tight for leverage; it turns into a wedged wrestling match, both of you jammed.

They hiss through their regulator, voice distorted: “Not through.”

Then they do the Tidewarden thing—practical capture. A gloved thumb hooks under your jawline and drives your face sideways toward the wall-water seam, trying to force your mouth/nose under and make you reflexively break position.

Above and behind, the pursuit team reacts to the splash and chain movement. Boots hit rungs—someone is coming down the riser now, fast. A light beam knifes across the channel mouth, searching for your partner and then snapping to you at the slit.

Threats, concrete:
- Your forearm is partially looped by the diver’s line; if they pull, you’ll be pinned or dragged deeper into the slit.
- The diver is actively trying to dunk you to break your resistance.
- A pursuer is descending with a light; seconds from reaching the channel, they can grab you from behind while you’re wedged.

#### Turn 196 **[PLAYER]**

I tuck my chin hard to deny the dunk, then saw my knife across the line cinched on my forearm until it parts. As it loosens, I drive my thumb into the edge of their mask/regulator seal and wrench it sideways to flood their mouthpiece, then shove off the wall and slip past them into the slit, calling back to my partner, “Don’t stop—keep moving!”

*Agent reasoning: I’m wedged and about to get grabbed from behind; fastest escape is to break the loop, disable the diver’s breathing, and slip past before the climber reaches me.*

#### Turn 197 **[GAME]**

You tuck your chin and twist your shoulder, denying them the easy dunk. Your jaw grinds against your own collarbone, but your face stays out of the waterline.

Your knife hand works by feel. You saw across the cinched cord on your forearm—wet line, tough fibers—and on the third hard pull it finally gives. The tension snaps free with a sting, leaving a shallow burn around your skin where it bit.

The diver reacts instantly to the loss of control: they surge forward to re-hook you, but the slit is too tight. Their elbow jams against the concrete and they lose half a beat.

You take that beat and jam your thumb into the edge of their mask/regulator seal and wrench.

Outcome: you don’t rip the whole rig off—the straps hold—but you break the seal enough to make it fail. Water floods in around the mouthpiece area. The diver coughs through the regulator, a choking, panicked stutter, and their hands fly to their face to reseat the mask.

That gives you the gap you needed. You shove off the wall, shoulder and hip scraping concrete, and squeeze past them deeper into the culvert slit.

Consequence: the passage is narrower than it looked from outside. You get through, but it costs you skin—your upper arm and ribs rasp hard on grit and barnacled concrete. Your breath comes hot and sharp.

Behind you, the diver—half-blinded, re-sealing—lashes out and grabs at your ankle. Their glove catches your boot heel for a moment, then slips off as you kick free.

Above the channel mouth, the descending pursuer’s light snaps directly into the slit. You hear them shout, close now: “She’s in the culvert—after her!”

Your partner, in the open water, answers your call by moving—scrambling along the left wall, splashing away into the darker run beyond the chain curtain. You can hear them, but you can’t see them anymore.

New, immediate threat: you are now in a tight culvert with an impaired but still mobile diver behind you, and at least one pursuer about to enter from the channel mouth with a light. If they commit into the slit, you’ll be trapped between them in a space too narrow to turn and fight clean.

#### Turn 198 **[PLAYER]**

I kick off hard and crawl-sprint deeper, then wedge my waterlogged map case crosswise in the slit behind me as a jam. “Enjoy the choke point,” I mutter, and keep moving until I hit the first bend or junction—then I pause just long enough to listen for which side has flow/air.

*Agent reasoning: I’m about to get pinched in a one-way crawl; fastest is to block pursuit behind me and gain distance toward any junction or grate.*

#### Turn 199 **[GAME]**

You kick off and crawl-sprint—forearms and knees pumping in a tight, wet chute. The slit narrows and widens in pulses, concrete scraping your shoulders; the water is only a few inches deep here, but it drags at you like glue.

You reach back for the jam and realize the problem immediately: you don’t have a map case to wedge.

Your maps are loose, waterlogged sheets—no rigid tube, no hard shell. You can’t cross-brace the culvert with paper. You can try to stuff them in as a wad, but they’ll just pulp and wash.

You do it anyway—shoving a fistful of soggy sheets and their straps into a hairline constriction where the culvert pinches.

Outcome: it makes a *momentary* snag. The paper catches on aggregate and old cable staples and the water eddies.

Immediate consequence: behind you, you hear the diver’s hands slapping forward, then the harsh rasp of someone else entering the slit—boots scraping, not fins. The pursuer with the light commits into the mouth, and the beam turns the culvert into a white tunnel.

They hit your paper-wad and tear straight through it with a wet ripping sound.

A voice—close, male, breathy with effort: “She’s ahead. Keep pressure.”

The diver you flooded is coughing and re-seating their mask; you hear the regulator chatter, but they’re still moving, using the pursuer’s light as their guide.

You keep moving until the first bend: a rightward kink where the culvert turns and the water changes sound.

You pause and listen.

- To the right (around the bend): a faint warm draft, dry on your cheek, and a higher-pitched hiss like air moving through a smaller throat. The water noise dulls.
- Behind you: splashing, scraping, and the light beam starting to strobe across the bend as they round it.

Threat, clear: they are in the slit with you and closing. The bend is your only break in line-of-sight, and you have maybe a few seconds before the light hits your back again.

#### Turn 200 **[PLAYER]**

I hug the right wall and take the kink hard, killing my profile from their light, then jam my knife into the nearest seam/soft mortar where the warm draft’s strongest and pry for a hidden grate or maintenance slot. If it gives at all, I squeeze through and keep crawling without looking back.

*Agent reasoning: They’re seconds behind; the warm draft/hiss means a smaller air path—likely a service crawl or vent that breaks pursuit. No time to fight.*

#### Turn 201 **[GAME]**

You take the kink tight, shoulder grinding the right wall, keeping your body flat so their beam has less to catch. For a second the light flares on the wet curve behind you—then it’s gone as the bend eats it.

You find the warmest thread of air by feel: a hairline seam where two pours meet, gritty mortar softened by salt. You jam the knife tip in and pry.

Outcome: it gives—barely. Not a hidden door, not a clean slot. A thin concrete skim pops with a dry *tick* and flakes away, revealing a rusted cable takeoff: a narrow oval opening with a bent grille behind it, half-choked with old wire sheath and algae-dried silt.

You lever again. The grille shifts with a tortured squeal and one side tears loose, leaving a jagged gap *just* big enough if you go sideways and exhale.

Consequence: the squeal carries. Behind you, the pursuer’s voice snaps sharp, closer than you want: “Right wall—she’s working something!”

The light slashes around the bend, jittering as they crawl. It catches your knife hand and the fresh pale scrape where you broke the skim.

You don’t look back. You shove your shoulder into the gap.

Outcome: you get through, but it bites you. The torn grille rakes your upper arm and ribs; you feel warm wetness immediately—blood in thin lines. Your hip sticks for a heartbeat on a jagged edge, then you wrench free and spill into a narrower service throat that angles upward. The air is drier here and smells of old insulation and copper.

Immediate threat: behind you, metal shrieks as the pursuer grabs the torn grille and yanks. It flexes wider under force. A hand comes through, fingers clawing for purchase, and the beam spears into the service throat, washing the tight space ahead of you in harsh white.

The diver—still coughing—arrives at the bend and barks through their regulator, muffled: “Don’t let her climb. Pin her in the takeoff.”

You are in the maintenance slot and moving, but they’ve found it and they’re forcing the opening wider. If they get shoulders through, you’ll be trapped in a tube too tight to turn and fight—caught from behind with nowhere to sidestep.

#### Turn 202 **[PLAYER]**

I keep crawling uphill and, without stopping, yank at any loose cable/strap in the service throat to tangle the opening; then I kick back hard at the torn grille supports to bend them inward and snag the pursuer’s reaching arm. “Wrong tunnel,” I growl, and push for the next hatch/branch—anything that breaks line-of-sight.

*Agent reasoning: They’ve got the opening and a light—if they get in, I’m done. Fastest is to collapse/deny the choke point and keep climbing toward air.*

#### Turn 203 **[GAME]**

You keep crawling uphill, palms sliding over dust-caked insulation and slick old sheath. There’s loose cable here—dead runs someone cut long ago. You hook two fingers under a loop and yank as you go.

Outcome: it pulls free in a snarled bundle and whips back toward the torn opening. It doesn’t “net” the gap, but it does drape across it and catch on the jagged grille edge.

Then you kick back—hard—boot heel smashing into the torn grille supports.

Outcome: you don’t fold the whole thing shut, but you *do* bend a support inward. The pursuer’s reaching arm is still through, and the bent metal bites down across their forearm with a dull, meaty *clank*.

He yells—close, sudden pain: “AH—fuck! My arm!”

His light jerks, beam skittering wildly along the service throat ceiling, then smearing across your back as he tries to pull away. The cable bundle you yanked tightens with his movement and snags around his wrist and the light’s lanyard.

Consequence: it buys you seconds, not safety. You hear him wrenching, breath turning ragged, and the metal squeals as he forces the grille back the other way. He’s strong, and leverage favors him at the mouth.

Behind him, the diver’s muffled voice through the regulator: “Cut it—cut the cable! Get in!”

A blade scrapes on metal. Sparks spit briefly at the opening, tiny bright flecks in the beam.

You push uphill toward anything that breaks sight. The throat rises into a cramped junction where the takeoff meets a vertical riser—dry rungs set into the concrete, leading up into darkness. Above, you can smell *cleaner* air leaking—faintly sweet, like filtered intake.

But the threat is immediate and clear: the pursuer is cutting his arm free and widening the entry. Once he’s through, he’ll have you in a straight, tight run with a light and a knife—close enough to grab your ankle.

#### Turn 204 **[PLAYER]**

I grab the dry rungs and climb hard, three rungs at a time, keeping my knife clenched in my teeth. As soon as I’m a body-length up, I kick loose grit and any dangling cable down the shaft to rain into their face and light, then keep climbing toward that cleaner-air leak without stopping.

*Agent reasoning: Vertical riser breaks line-of-sight and gets me out of the tube where they can ankle-grab; I’ll climb fast and make the entry harder to follow.*

#### Turn 205 **[GAME]**

You hit the rungs and haul up fast, shoulders burning as the shaft narrows your movement into a straight line. The concrete here is dry enough to bite your palms; the rungs are cold metal, gritty with mineral bloom.

A body-length up, you scissor a boot against the wall and kick.

Outcome: you knock down a sheet of dry grit and rust flakes, plus a dangling loop of dead cable you’d missed on the way in. It rains into the junction below in a dirty curtain.

Immediate effect: the pursuer’s light coughs as grit hits the lens. He swears and throws an arm up to shield his face. You hear him choking once, then spitting: “—eyes—!”

The diver arrives at the base of the riser just as the debris falls. Their regulator warbles as they flinch back; the beam wobbles and skates up the shaft, briefly catching your boots and the knife clenched between your teeth.

They don’t stop. The pursuer commits to the climb anyway—metal clanging as he grabs the first rungs one-handed, the other arm still half-numbed from the grille bite. The diver hangs back a half-step, keeping the light angled up to track you.

You keep climbing toward the cleaner-air leak. Above, the leak is real: a thin, steady stream of cool, filtered air coming from a hatch seam. New bolts glint faintly where your eyes adjust—too clean for the drowned stacks.

Consequence: the hatch is not free. A short length of chain is looped through the wheel handle and padlocked—newer metal, oiled. Whoever sealed this expected someone to try it from below.

Below you, the pursuer is climbing fast despite the grit, boots hammering rungs: “She’s going for the hatch! Don’t let her lock us out!”

Threat, clear: you’re about to hit a locked hatch with no key and no time to work it while someone climbs up under you. If you stop at the hatch, you’ll be caught in the shaft. If you try to force it, the noise will carry and you may not have the leverage one-handed.

#### Turn 206 **[PLAYER]**

I hook a boot on a rung, swing down a half-body length, and as his head/light comes into reach I slash at his handhold/strap and kick his forearm hard off the rung. “Climb somewhere else.” Then I drop past him into the junction, hit the service throat low, and crawl-sprint back the way we came to break their line-of-sight.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is chained—no time to pick it. Best move is to turn the shaft into a killzone: drop fast, cut his support, and use the fall to buy a gap to escape back into the junction.*

#### Turn 207 **[GAME]**

You hook your boot, swing down, and meet him on the climb.

Your knife flashes in the shaft’s tight light. You slash at what you can reach—his wrist strap and the light lanyard—then drive your heel into his forearm.

Outcome: the cut bites through webbing and into skin. The strap parts with a snap; his light jerks loose and swings, smacking the wall. Your kick knocks his forearm off the rung.

He loses his hold.

For half a second he’s just weight and panic. Then his other hand snatches a lower rung, but the injured arm flails and scrapes the wall. His boots skid, ringing rungs as he drops two, maybe three steps before he catches himself. He howls, raw and close: “YOU—!”

The diver below throws the beam up instinctively; the shaft fills with jittering glare and your shadow stutters across the concrete. The pursuer tries to climb again, but his cut strap and bleeding hand make him hesitate—he’s shaking it out, trying to regrip.

You drop past him.

Consequence: there isn’t room to “slip by clean.” Your shoulder clips him; he swings into you. His free hand claws at your jacket and finds fabric. For a heartbeat he has you by the back seam.

You tear free—leaving cloth in his fist—and hit the junction hard on your feet and one knee. Pain shoots up your shin where you smack the concrete lip.

You dive into the service throat low and start crawl-sprinting back downslope.

Immediate reaction: the diver commits. They don’t follow into the throat yet—they shove the light to the mouth and angle it to pin you. “Stop! STOP!” comes muffled through the regulator, and then the hard *clack* of something metal on metal—like a hook-pole tip tapping for reach.

Behind them, the pursuer drops to the junction, breathing harsh, voice gone mean and steady now: “She’s running it back. Cut her off—culvert side.”

Threat, clear: they’ve got your line-of-sight with the beam and they’re switching from chase to containment. If there’s a second entry—or someone already staged in the culvert slit—you’re sprinting into a pinch point with a light behind you and a possible body ahead.

#### Turn 208 **[PLAYER]**

I kill my crawl for one beat, yank the loose cable bundle across the throat to snag their hook-pole and smear their light, then roll my body flat and push hard into the darkest edge. If I hit any side conduit or seam before the bend, I take it immediately—otherwise I double back at the last second and go up the riser again to force the locked hatch fight on my terms.

*Agent reasoning: They’re trying to cut me off at the culvert, so I need a fast diversion and a different exit—use the cable clutter and darkness to break the beam, then take any side takeoff before the bend.*

#### Turn 209 **[GAME]**

You stop for a single beat and whip the loose cable bundle across the throat like a blind. It catches.

The hook-pole tip *clinks* into the cable and the bundle wraps half a turn around it. At the same moment it slaps the diver’s light, smearing the beam into a dirty flare and knocking it off-angle. The diver jerks back, regulator barking. “—tangled!”

You flatten and push into the darkest edge, shoulder scraping the wall. Your breath is loud in your own ears; the throat is tight enough that every movement is a rasp of fabric and grit.

Consequence: the cable trick buys you a second, but it also gives them something to pull.

You feel it: the bundle goes taut behind you, dragged hard. The hook-pole is being used like a winch to sweep the throat. Metal scrapes concrete as they drag it side-to-side, probing for your legs.

You reach the first bend—warm draft, right kink—just as the beam steadies again. The light knifes down the throat and catches your boot sole for a blink.

“No—there!” the pursuer snaps, voice raw but focused.

You search for a seam, a takeoff—anything before committing around the bend.

There is one: a recessed wall box on the right side just before the kink, its cover plate hanging by one screw. It’s dark inside, just big enough to jam a body into if you fold hard, but it’s not a tunnel—more like a service cavity with cable stubs and sharp edges.

You take it immediately, twisting in sideways. The loose plate grates against your ribs. Inside, you’re pinned tight; the air smells like old rubber and mouse-dry rot.

Outside, the hook-pole scrapes closer, dragging the cable. The diver’s beam sweeps the floor, then the walls. The pursuer’s boots slosh in the shallow film, stopping right at the kink.

Threat: if the beam hits the wall box opening, you’re found at arm’s length with nowhere to run. And the cable you used is still taut—if they keep hauling, it could snag on the box lip and *point* straight at you.
