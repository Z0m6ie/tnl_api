### Turn 4 [PLAYER]

Mara Vance is a disgraced ex-marine who survived a classified deep-space boarding gone wrong and got left holding the blame. Now she works as a salvage-security specialist on derelict stations, armored up and always expecting something to move in the dark. Hard-edged, hyper-vigilant, and openly defiant, she carries a constant chip on her shoulder that dares anyone to doubt her. Her goal is to uncover the truth behind the incident that ruined her career—and make sure whatever’s hunting the corridors doesn’t leave witnesses to rewrite it again.

*Agent reasoning: Generated aggressive-style character for Sci-Fi Horror Survival*

### Turn 5 [GAME]

Here's your character:

**Mara Vance**
*Salvage-security specialist (ex-marine)*

Once a decorated marine, Mara became the sole surviving witness of a classified deep-space boarding action that ended in a silent massacre—and the brass pinned the failure on her to bury what really happened. Discharged in disgrace and hounded by rumors, she drifted into contract work where her combat instincts still pay the bills. She keeps fragments of the incident locked behind anger and routine, but the same impossible details keep resurfacing whenever she steps into a darkened hull.

**Traits:** Hard-edged, Hyper-vigilant, Defiant, Resourceful, Paranoid under pressure
**Goal:** Uncover the truth behind the classified boarding incident that destroyed her career, clear her name on her own terms, and ensure whatever stalks the derelicts can’t erase or rewrite the evidence again.

### Turn 9 [GAME]

Dock 9 of **Kestrel Spindle Station** is in its false-morning cycle, lights ramping up from red to pale white. Cold air tastes of oxidized metal and old coolant. Beyond the bay doors, the derelict hulk hangs in slow spin, emergency strips pulsing on its skin like weak signals.

You stand on the mag-plate ramp at the mouth of the boarding tube, helmet sealed, rifle slung but ready. Your left glove runs a practiced sweep over the tube’s latch points—tamper seal, hinge wear, microfracture—same routine you used on live-ops breaching collars. You mark angles and blind spots with quick glances, then tap your wrist slate to start a continuous bodycam loop Helix can’t “misplace.”

A Helix handler strides up the ramp, short and broad in a patched vac-suit with a cooperative emblem stitched over old scorch marks. Their name tag reads **Pell**. They don’t meet your eyes; they hold out a **sealed black-box canister** like it’s hot. “Recovered from a frost-welded compartment,” Pell says, voice flat through comms. “Log it as nonfunctional debris. Don’t open it. Don’t mention it.” The canister hums against your palm, faint through the insulation, and your visor flashes a residue scan without being asked: **BIOMETRIC MATCH—MARA VANCE / USMC ID**. The timestamp crawls in after it, years after your discharge.

Before you can speak, your comms crackle—port security broadcast, clipped and polite: **“Detainment notice. Mara Vance. Report for Admiralty debriefing.”** Down on the deck, two dock guards shift their stance toward the ramp. At the far edge of the bay, three workers in Vesper-gray coveralls stop pretending to load crates; one lifts a handheld receiver, and it chirps a repeating pattern that tightens in your ears when the canister is close.

Pell’s hand hovers near the canister seal, the guards start walking, and the Vesper runners watch you like they’ve finally found the right signal. You are holding evidence the Admiralty buried—and everyone here just moved at once.

### Turn 10 [PLAYER]

I shove the black-box canister into my kit and snap my rifle into a low-ready. “Pell—move. Now.” I stride up the boarding tube toward the derelict; if the guards step in, I shoulder-check the first one into the deck and keep going.

*Agent reasoning: Everyone’s converging and the canister is tagged to me—if I let them take me, it disappears. I’m not talking my way out; I’m moving and using force if they try to stop me.*

### Turn 11 [GAME]

The canister slides into your kit with a solid thunk against the inner frame. The hum doesn’t stop; it migrates—now it’s against your ribs, a distant vibration that makes your teeth feel slightly too present. Your rifle comes up to low-ready, muzzle down the tube.

“Pell—move. Now.”

Pell flinches and sidesteps hard, nearly clipping the handrail, giving you the lane without argument. “Mara—don’t—” is all they manage before swallowing it.

You hit the boarding tube at a brisk walk that turns into a controlled push. Halfway up, the nearer dock guard commits—boots clack on the ramp, body angling to block. “Vance! Stop. Admiralty—”

You don’t stop. You drive your shoulder through his chest plate.

The impact is real, not cinematic: his breath barks out, he pinwheels, and the mag in his boots fails for a half-second as his heel skates. He slams into the deck grating and stays down, one arm curling around his ribs, helmet ringing. His partner yells, “Assault! Lock the tube—lock it!”

A klaxon begins to wind up in the bay—low, rising. The boarding tube’s inner bulkhead light flips from green to amber as the station tries to engage a safety interlock behind you. The door doesn’t slam shut—too slow, too much inertia in the mechanism—but you hear the latch motors start to cycle.

From the bay behind, the Vesper workers peel off their crates. One of them—thin, shaved head—raises a compact launcher the size of a forearm. Not a gun: a **net-stapler**. “Don’t damage her!” someone barks. They’re aiming up the tube after you.

Ahead, the derelict’s outer hatch is already dogged open just enough for a person to slip through—like someone prepped it before you arrived. Cold breath spills out of the gap, carrying that old coolant tang.

You’re ten meters from the derelict hatch. Behind you: an alarm, one guard down, one calling in, and Vesper lining a capture shot up the tube. The station interlock is trying to close the tube behind you, but it hasn’t caught yet.

```

### Turn 12 [PLAYER]

I snap my rifle up and put two quick shots into the net-stapler’s mechanism/hand, then lunge through the ajar hatch. Once inside, I spin and dog the hatch shut, slamming an emergency lock and yanking any manual release I can find—then I bark into comms, “Pell! If you want to live, tell me who prepped this hatch—now.”

*Agent reasoning: Net-stapler means capture; I need to break line-of-sight and deny pursuit. The derelict hatch is my choke point—get inside, then seal and booby-trap.*

### Turn 13 [GAME]



### Turn 14 [PLAYER]

I snap my rifle up and fire two fast shots at the net-stapler—one into the mechanism, one into the shooter’s hand—then dive through the ajar hatch. Inside, I spin, dog it shut, slam the emergency lock, and yank any manual release I can reach. “Pell! If you want to live, tell me who prepped this hatch—now.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m not getting bagged on a dock. Cripple the capture tool, get inside, seal the hatch, then squeeze Pell for answers.*

### Turn 15 [GAME]

Your rifle snaps up. Two tight cracks hammer the tube.

The first round punches into the net-stapler’s forward housing. The tool coughs a burst of sparks and dies mid-cycle, its cartridge clattering off the guardrail. The second round takes the shaved-head runner in the hand—clean through the webbing between thumb and forefinger. He howls and drops the launcher, blood globing and drifting in slow beads before his suit’s microseals cinch and smear it into a dark stain.

“Fuck—MED!” one of the other Vesper workers shouts, but they don’t rush him; they flatten instead, suddenly wary of your sightline. Dock Guard #2 ducks behind the ramp strut and barks into his mic, “She’s armed, she’s boarding—seal that tube!”

You dive through the derelict’s ajar hatch.

Cold hits like a slap. The interior is dim, emergency strips pulsing weakly. Your boots find purchase on a frost-slick deckplate; you catch yourself on the inner frame, then pivot back to the hatch.

You dog the wheel shut—metal groans, old seals complain—and slam the emergency lock lever down. It *clicks* into place… then immediately chatters, like it can’t decide if it’s engaged. You yank a manual release cable and feel it bite your glove, stiff with ice. The hatch stays shut, but not cleanly; there’s a thin, bright line at the seam where the gasket doesn’t fully seat.

From the other side, something impacts the hatch—boots or a shoulder—once, hard. The wheel judders in your hands. A voice muffled through the metal, Dock Guard #2: “Open it! You’re under detainment—”

Your comms spit static, then Pell comes through, breathing fast. “Mara—listen. I didn’t— I swear I didn’t prep anything. That hatch was logged *welded* yesterday.” A pause, then quieter, scared: “Helix doesn’t have cutters that clean. Admiralty does. And—” their voice drops further— “Vesper’s been paying station hands to ‘soften’ seals. Someone wanted you inside.”

Behind you, deeper in the derelict, a panel ticks in time with the ship’s slow spin. Your visor briefly highlights a smear on the bulkhead beside the hatch—like a handprint in oil-black residue—fresh enough to shine. It is on the *inside* of the ship.

Outside the hatch, the pounding stops. Not because they gave up—because they’ve changed tactics. You hear the faint whine of a tool spooling up against the seam, searching for purchase on the imperfect seal.

### Turn 16 [PLAYER]

I back off the hatch two steps, plant my feet, and fire a short burst into the seam/locking mechanism from the inside to warp it shut. Then I yank my knife, scrape a sample of that oil-black handprint into a sealable patch pouch, and sweep my rifle light down the corridor. “Pell—name the Admiralty team on Dock 9. Now. And tell me if this derelict has internal cameras or a map, fast.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re cutting in; I need distance, a choke point, and answers fast. The fresh residue inside means I’m not alone—clear the immediate area and set a trap while grilling Pell.*

### Turn 17 [GAME]



### Turn 18 [PLAYER]

I back off the hatch two steps, brace, and hammer a short burst into the seam/lock assembly from inside to warp it shut. I draw my knife, scrape the oil-black handprint into a sealable patch pouch, then sweep my rifle light down the corridor. “Pell—name the Admiralty team on Dock 9. Now. And does this derelict have internal cameras or a map?”

*Agent reasoning: I’m not letting them cut in behind me; I’ll brute-force the hatch into staying shut, pocket evidence, then demand names and intel so I know who’s hunting me and how to move inside.*

### Turn 19 [GAME]

You brace and fire. The burst hammers the seam and lock assembly—metal flashes white-hot in pinprick blooms, spalling flecks of alloy across the deck. The hatch wheel jolts once, then the lock’s chatter turns into a single ugly *clunk* as something inside warps out of alignment.

On the other side, the cutting whine stutters and stops. A muffled curse carries through the hatch. Whatever tool they had just lost its bite—at least for the moment.

But your shots also do something else: the inner gasket smokes, and the air right around the seam turns sharp and acrid. Your visor flags a brief pressure fluctuation as the damaged seal “breathes” once—an inward sip—then stabilizes. The hatch is more *jammed* than *sealed* now.

You pull your knife and scrape the oil-black smear. It doesn’t flake like grease; it comes up in a thin, tacky ribbon that strings for a second before snapping into the patch pouch. The residue clings to the blade like it wants to crawl back.

You sweep your rifle light down the corridor.

The beam cuts through drifting dust and frost motes. Ten meters in, the passage bends left around a ribbed bulkhead. Along the right wall: conduit runs beaded with condensation, and a maintenance alcove with its cover hanging open. Inside that alcove, a status panel is dark—except for a single diode that blinks in a pattern that doesn’t match the emergency strip cadence. Once your light hits it, it pauses, then resumes—slower.

Pell comes back on comms, voice tight. “Dock 9 Admiralty presence isn’t a team—there’s no manifest. That’s the problem. Port Security got a detainment notice routed from *Office of Anomalous Losses*, stamped by a clerk ID: **Lysa Koen**. That name’s been on Helix ‘audit’ emails before.”

A beat of static, then: “Internal cameras—if they’re still powered, they’d be on the ship’s old security loop. Map… there should be a deckplan in the service crawl or a bridge terminal, but this hull’s registry is scraped. Helix couldn’t pull a schematic. If you find a working node, ping me its port ID and I’ll try to handshake.”

Outside the hatch, you hear boots repositioning—two sets at least—then a quieter sound: something being taped or clamped to the metal, careful and deliberate. Not prying now. Setting.

Whatever they’re doing, they’re preparing to force the hatch without cutting it.

### Turn 20 [PLAYER]

I backpedal hard to the bend, take cover behind the ribbed bulkhead, and aim my rifle at the hatch line-of-sight. Then I snap my light onto that maintenance alcove diode and move in fast, ripping the cover wider to find a port or manual controls—anything that gives cameras, doors, or atmosphere. “Pell—Lysa Koen, got it. Stand by for a port ID. If they breach, I’m shooting through the hatch—so tell me now: is this hull pressurized enough to vent them if I pop something?”

*Agent reasoning: They’re setting a charge or clamp; staying by the hatch is stupid. I need distance, cover, and a way to flank or vent them—plus that blinking diode looks like a live node I can use for cameras/map fast.*

### Turn 21 [GAME]

You backpedal to the bend and tuck in behind the ribbed bulkhead. From here you’ve got a narrow lane back to the hatch—enough to see the inner wheel and that imperfect seam line, but not enough for anyone outside to get a clean shot at you unless they come through.

You snap your light onto the maintenance alcove and close the distance fast. The cover is already half-hung; you rip it wider. The hinge squeals and a brittle strip of frost shears off.

Inside: a compact service bay—old ship-standard. A manual atmosphere tap (three-position lever), a diagnostics jack, and a palm-sized status screen that should be dead. The blinking diode isn’t a simple indicator; it’s a tiny optical sensor, jury-rigged onto the bay’s frame with station tape. Someone planted it here recently.

When your light hits it, the sensor’s blink pattern changes again—then the status screen *wakes* with a thin green line of text, like it’s been waiting for motion:

**NODE 3A — ACCESS: DENIED**  
**LAST AUTH: VANCE, M.**  
**TIME: — — : — — : — —**

No timestamp. Just your name.

You jam your fingers into the diagnostics jack looking for an exposed port ID. The jack collar is warm compared to the surrounding metal, like current has been running through it. Stamped into the plate beneath: **3A-19**.

Behind you at the hatch, the careful clamping sound stops. A new sound replaces it: a soft, escalating whirr—an inflator or a chemical bladder pressurizing against the seam. A wedge charge, meant to force the hatch by brute expansion rather than cutting. The wheel trembles a fraction, then holds… for now.

Pell answers, fast. “I don’t have reliable pressure numbers—Helix logs say the hulk’s at *maintenance atmosphere*, thin but present. Enough to fog your visor, not enough to explosively vent a team. If you punch a hole, you’ll get a pull, not a decompression blast. It might drag loose debris and it’ll scream in their ears—but it won’t suck them out like a movie.”

As Pell talks, the service bay screen adds a second line, unprompted:

**CAM LOOP: ACTIVE**  
**FEED: /HATCH/DOCK9**

So yes—there are cameras. And something on this ship is already watching the hatch for you.

```

### Turn 22 [PLAYER]

I slam the atmosphere lever to **VENT** and keep my rifle trained down the hatch lane, then I jam my comms. “Pell—NODE 3A-19. Get me that cam feed and any door/pressure controls, now.”  
I lean into the service bay and start ripping at the panel and wiring to bypass the lock—no finesse—then I settle back behind the ribbed bulkhead, ready to put rounds into the first helmet that clears the hatch.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to wedge-breach the hatch; I need immediate control—cameras and atmosphere—then I’ll ambush the first body through. That “LAST AUTH: VANCE” is a trap or someone spoofing me, so I’m forcing the node and using the cam feed to time my shots.*

### Turn 23 [GAME]



### Turn 24 [PLAYER]

I slam the atmosphere lever to **VENT** and keep my rifle trained down the hatch lane. “Pell—NODE 3A-19. Get me that cam feed and any door or pressure controls, now.”

I rip into the service bay paneling and wiring with my knife and gauntlet, trying to brute-force a bypass. Then I drop back behind the ribbed bulkhead, sighting the hatch and waiting to put rounds into the first helmet that comes through.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch team is about to breach; I need to make the environment hostile and grab any control/cam advantage immediately, then set a kill lane.*

### Turn 25 [GAME]



### Turn 26 [PLAYER]

I smack my comms twice. “Pell, talk to me—do you have NODE 3A-19 or not?”  

If no answer, I kill my light, move back to the hatch lane, and plant a strip-charge from my kit on the corridor wall beside the hatch—set to blow inward the moment they breach—then I shoulder my rifle and hold the angle.

*Agent reasoning: Nothing’s happening on-screen; I’m not waiting. I need immediate control or intel, and if comms are dead I’ll act on the breach threat.*

### Turn 27 [GAME]

Your comms click twice under your thumb.

Static. Then Pell’s voice comes back chopped and doubled, like two recordings fighting for the same channel.

“—ra, I’ve got—” *hiss* “NODE—” *hiss* “—3A—19—” *hiss* “—no feed, it’s—”  

Then, underneath Pell, a second voice rides the carrier—flat, close, and wrong, like it’s speaking from inside your helmet:

“**Mara Vance. Stand by for debriefing.**”

Your visor flickers. The service bay screen across the alcove flashes once: **CAM LOOP: ACTIVE** then goes dark.

You kill your light.

In the dark, the hatch lane is a thin silhouette: the inner wheel, the seam, the wedge device pressed against it. The whirr spikes—pressure building.

You move back and slap a strip-charge onto the corridor wall beside the hatch.

It doesn’t stick.

The adhesive pad skates on a film you can’t see—oil-black, tacky in the wrong way, like it’s sweating out of the metal itself. You press harder; it slides again and leaves a smeared crescent on your glove. The charge’s arming LED blinks once, then steadies—armed, but not placed.

At the hatch, the wedge finally bites. Metal groans. The wheel twitches a quarter-turn on its own, not from hands—like the mechanism is being forced from the other side. A hairline gap opens at the seam and cold, thin air whistles in, carrying the sharp sting of propellant.

A voice from outside, muffled by the hatch: “Hold—don’t—” then a bang as something shifts.

The gap widens to a finger’s width. A narrow beam of light stabs through from Dock 9, sweeping the corridor just below your position.

You’re in the dark with an armed strip-charge in your hand that won’t adhere, a breach in progress, and at least one person outside trying to control whoever’s forcing entry.

```json
{"inventory_add":[],"inventory_remove":[],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":[],"npcs_add":[]}
```

### Turn 28 [PLAYER]

I palm the armed strip-charge, yank off anything that’ll snag, and shove it into the widening seam like a grenade. “Pell—if you hear me, they’re breaching!”

The second it’s in, I snap to the bulkhead edge and dump a tight burst at the first shadow/light that tries to push through, then I peel back deeper around the bend to avoid the blast and any return fire.

*Agent reasoning: The charge won’t stick and the breach is imminent; I need a kill zone now. I’ll use the charge as a hand-thrown blast into the gap and immediately engage the first target, then reposition before they return fire.*

### Turn 29 [GAME]

You jam the strip-charge into the seam the moment it’s wide enough. This time it catches—wedged between the inner lip and the dogging ring, half-swallowed by the hatch like a bad tooth.

“Pell—if you hear me, they’re breaching!”

Your comm answers with a wet burst of carrier noise. No words.

A shape crowds the gap—light first, then the rounded edge of a helmet trying to angle in. You snap out, rifle tight, and put a controlled burst right into the beam.

Rounds spark off metal and something hard; one hits softer—there’s a sharp, human yelp and the light jerks wildly, smearing the corridor in white arcs. The helmet vanishes from the slit.

From the other side, someone shouts, panicked and close: “Back—BACK—there’s a charge—!”

Too late.

The strip-charge goes off inside the seam with a flat, concussive *WHUMP* that you feel in your teeth more than you hear. The hatch ring deforms and the gap flashes orange-white; fragments of gasket and a spray of frost and black oil spit into the corridor like shrapnel. The hatch wheel snaps a fraction, then locks crooked.

You peel back around the bend as the blast wind slaps down the corridor, carrying burned adhesive, propellant, and that coolant-metal tang. A second later, return fire rakes where you were—two sharp cracks and impacts chewing the ribbed bulkhead edge, sending needle-splinters of alloy pinging into the deck.

Outside the hatch, a voice—Dock Guard #2, strained—barks through the damaged seam: “Cease fire! Cease—! We’ve got one down! Vance, don’t—”

Then another voice cuts in over him, calm and amplified like it’s coming through an official mask amp: “Mara Vance. You are ordered to stand down.”

The hatch isn’t fully breached—but it’s warped, leaking a thin, constant whistle. Someone is still out there with a weapon and at least one injured body in the lane. Your glove is smeared with oil-black residue from the seam.

```json
{"inventory_add":[],"inventory_remove":["Strip-charge"],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":[],"npcs_add":[]}
```

### Turn 30 [PLAYER]

I press in behind the bend, rifle up. “Negative. Identify yourself with code and badge number—now. Dock Guard, drag your wounded back or I finish this.”

I scrape the oil-black smear off my glove onto the deck, then ghost a step deeper down the corridor to a new angle and hold on the warped seam, finger ready—waiting for the next peek.

*Agent reasoning: That “stand down” voice is either a hostile spoof or the same nightmare chain-of-command crap that got me burned; either way I’m not surrendering. They’ve got a downed person—leverage. I’ll force ID and buy seconds while I reposition to a better kill lane.*

### Turn 31 [GAME]

You tuck in behind the bend, rifle shouldered, muzzle tracking the warped seam down the hatch lane. Your voice carries clean in the corridor.

“Negative. Identify yourself with code and badge number—now. Dock Guard, drag your wounded back or I finish this.”

On the far side of the hatch, there’s a scuffle—boots scraping the tube deck, someone grunting as weight shifts. A thin smear of light wobbles at the seam, then dips away as if they’re trying to shield it.

Dock Guard #2 answers, breathy and tight with pain-adrenaline. “Dock Security—Kestrel Spindle—Unit Two! That wasn’t—” He cuts himself off, then louder, to someone beside him: “Get him back. Move!”

The amplified voice comes again, closer to the seam, calm to the point of sterile. “Admiralty Office of Anomalous Losses. Field Liaison. Badge number **AOL-17-443**. Code: **Tern-Gray**. Stand down and exit the derelict with hands visible.”

You scrape the oil-black smear off your glove onto the deck plating. It doesn’t splatter like grease—more like it *strings*, pulling a thin filament before it snaps and settles. The spot it lands on dulls the metal, as if the corridor’s finish drinks it in. For half a second your visor highlights it as a contaminant… then the tag blanks out and reverts to “NO DATA.”

You ghost one step deeper, changing your angle on the seam.

From this position you see the hatch ring clearly: warped inward, gasket shredded, a steady whisper of air bleeding through. And in the seam’s thin light line, something moves—too narrow to be a person. A gloved hand *should* appear first.

Instead, a pale strip—like a fingertip pressed to glass—slides along the gap from left to right, leaving a faint wet trace on the metal lip. It pauses exactly where you shoved the charge.

Outside, Dock Guard #2’s voice drops, frightened despite himself: “What the hell is—”

Then a hard metallic clink: something small rolls into the seam’s light line from the dock side and stops—cylindrical, about the size of a thumb. A sensor drone or a flash unit.

It sits there for a beat, inert.

Your comms crackle without you touching them, and Pell’s voice comes through in a rush, finally clear: “Mara—don’t let them get eyes inside—whatever’s on that ship is spoofing—”

The drone’s indicator LED blinks once.

```json
{"inventory_add":[],"inventory_remove":[],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":[],"npcs_add":[]}
```

### Turn 32 [PLAYER]

I snap two rounds into the little cylinder to kill it, then bark into the seam, “AOL-17-443 means nothing to me. Pull back from the hatch or I start shooting anything that moves on the other side.” I keep the rifle trained on the gap and shift my feet for a tighter brace, ready to fire the instant that pale strip shows again.

*Agent reasoning: I’m not letting some Admiralty spook or a drone get eyes in here—Pell warned it’s spoofing, and that fingertip thing is wrong. Fast, violent solution: kill the drone, then threaten them off the hatch while I keep my angle.*

### Turn 33 [GAME]

You put two rounds into the cylinder.

The first hit punches it sideways and cracks its casing; the second turns it into a brief, bright spit of sparks. The indicator LED dies. A curl of gray smoke threads out through the seam and gets yanked back toward Dock 9 by the pressure gradient.

Your shout carries through the warped hatch.

“AOL-17-443 means nothing to me. Pull back from the hatch or I start shooting anything that moves on the other side.”

For a moment, there’s only the thin whistle of the leak and the distant groan of the derelict.

Then Dock Guard #2, louder now, trying to keep control: “Liaison—step back! She’s armed and you’re not cleared—”

Something heavy scrapes against the hatch from the outside—like a shoulder or a tool braced against the ring. The seam flexes a fraction wider, protesting with a metallic squeal.

The amplified voice answers, still calm, but closer and more directive: “Vance, you have already fired on station security. Continued resistance will be treated as hostile action. Stand down.”

A sharp *thup* follows—another object strikes the hatch and clings. Not a cylinder this time: a flat puck the size of your palm, magnet-locked to the ring just above the seam. A faint blue arc skitters across its edge as it wakes up.

The whistle changes pitch. The puck starts to *cut*—not explosively, but steadily, heating the metal along the warp line. The seam begins to glow a dull red thread.

At the same time, that pale strip returns—right where the glow is forming—pressed from the *inside* of the hatch now, not the dock side. It drags slowly along the heated line, leaving a wet sheen that hisses when it touches the warming metal. The glow dims where it passes, as if the heat is being bled away.

Dock Guard #2’s voice breaks, suddenly raw: “That’s not us—! Liaison, what did you put on—”

Return fire doesn’t come. Instead, the breach attempt changes: they’re cutting, and something on your side of the hatch is interfering with it.

Your rifle is still trained on the gap. The threat is now twofold and immediate: an external cutting charge opening the hatch, and an unknown presence on the derelict side moving at the seam.

### Turn 34 [PLAYER]

I lean out just enough and dump rounds into the cutting puck to try to shatter it off the ring. “Dock Guard—if you’re not the ones doing that, then drag your ‘liaison’ back before I ventilate him through the seam.”

Then I backpedal to the next intersection for cover, plant myself on a hard angle facing the hatch lane, and key my comm: “Pell, I need an override—lock that hatch or dump pressure Dock 9 side. Anything.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re cutting in and whatever’s inside is right at the seam. I’m not letting either side control that hatch—destroy the cutter, then fall back to a kill zone and force them to talk.*

### Turn 35 [GAME]

You lean out and hose the puck.

Rounds hammer the hatch ring, throwing bright splinters of alloy. One slug catches the puck’s edge; it skitters a few centimeters, still magnet-locked, and the blue arc stutters. Another hit finally cracks its housing—there’s a brief flare, like an arc-welder choking, and the cutting line goes dark.

The seam stops glowing. The whistle drops back to its earlier pitch.

On the other side, Dock Guard #2 shouts, hoarse and furious: “Liaison! BACK UP—NOW!” You hear boots scramble, then a dragged weight. Someone—injured—cries out as they’re hauled away from the tube mouth.

The amplified voice snaps once, losing its calm for the first time: “Hold position. Vance is contained—”

A single shot answers him—Dock Guard #2 firing. Metal pings. Then silence, except for breathing and the faint leak.

You backpedal hard to the next intersection, planting yourself on a tight angle with the hatch lane in sight. From here you can see the warped hatch mouth as a sliver of light around the bend and the puck’s dead casing still stuck to the ring like a tick.

You key your comm. “Pell, I need an override—lock that hatch or dump pressure Dock 9 side. Anything.”

Pell comes in clipped, scared, and moving—background noise of a station corridor and someone shouting for med. “I don’t have hard control of Dock 9. Port authority does. Helix lease doesn’t touch pressure systems.” He swallows. “I can *ask* for a lockdown, but if Admiralty’s on-scene they’ll countermand it.”

A beat of static—then Pell again, lower: “Mara… I’m seeing a detainment notice hit your file. AOL is pushing it as ‘routine debrief.’ They’re not here for the guards.”

Down the hatch lane, you hear a new sound: a soft, rhythmic tap—tap… tap… tap—coming from the derelict side of the warped ring, like something lightly knocking from inside the metal. It’s not at the seam anymore; it’s traveling along the hatch frame, moving away from the breach point toward the tube’s upper quadrant.

Whatever left that pale strip is repositioning.

### Turn 36 [PLAYER]

I key my comm, low and sharp: “Pell, forget asking—start a noise storm on Dock 9 feeds. Spoof a hazard alarm, anything to buy me two minutes.”

I pull a frag bolt from my kit, whip it into the hatch lane aimed high at the upper quadrant where the tapping’s traveling, then immediately shift to the opposite side of the intersection and hold my rifle steady on the seam—ready to shoot the first limb, light, or tool that shows.

*Agent reasoning: AOL is trying to bag me; the hatch is compromised and something inside is moving along the frame. I need to stop the breach and remove the leverage—go loud, go decisive: sabotage the hatch from my side and reposition before they flank me.*

### Turn 37 [GAME]



### Turn 38 [PLAYER]

“Pell—forget asking. Flood Dock 9 feeds with a noise storm. Spoof a hazard alarm—anything. Buy me two minutes.”

I yank a frag bolt and whip it down the hatch lane aimed high at the upper quadrant where the tapping’s moving, then snap to the opposite side of the intersection and keep my rifle welded to the seam, waiting to shoot the first thing that shows.

*Agent reasoning: I need confusion on the dock side and to stop whatever’s moving along the hatch frame before it finds a new way in; explosives and a hard angle give me control.*

### Turn 39 [GAME]

Pell answers fast, breathless. “I can jam *some* of it—Dock 9’s a public spine, I don’t own their cams. But I can dirty the channel.”

A second later your comm hisses with layered garbage—burst static, looping error tones, a chopped-up evacuation message that sounds like it’s been stitched from old drills. Over it, you catch Dock Guard #2 yelling at someone off-mic: “—feeds are gone—who the hell is on the line—”

You yank the frag bolt and whip it down the lane.

It clacks off the bulkhead near the hatch mouth and sticks high on the frame where the tapping had been traveling. Half a heartbeat later it detonates with a hard, concussive pop that thumps through your chest even around the corner. Shrapnel rattles down the tube like hail. The warped hatch ring screams as fragments chew it; a spray of frost and grit erupts from the seam and then gets sucked back toward Dock 9.

The tapping stops.

Then something answers from the other side: not a voice—an impact. The hatch ring *bucks* once, as if hit from inside with a shoulder or a tool. The seam widens by a few millimeters, enough to spit a thin, white ribbon of vapor into the derelict corridor before the pressure equalizes and it thins.

You shift to the opposite side of the intersection, rifle steady on the seam.

A thin line of light appears in that widened gap—station-side illumination cutting through. In it, something slides into view briefly: not a limb, not a tool. A smear of oil-black residue, dragged across the metal from the *inside* of the derelict, leaving a fresh print that looks like the heel of a hand.

Dock Guard #2’s voice punches through the comm-storm for a second, closer now and panicked: “Vance—there’s someone in the tube with us— I can’t—” The transmission collapses into static.

At the seam, a small object rolls into the gap from the dock side and stops, wedged: a second puck—different housing, heavier, with a blinking amber status light. It doesn’t cut. It starts to *chirp* in a tight ultrasonic pattern that makes your teeth ache through the helmet.

The threat is immediate and clear: they’ve switched from cutting to a sensor/denial device at the seam, and the hatch gap is now wide enough for something on either side to probe through.

```json
{"inventory_add":[],"inventory_remove":["frag bolt"],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":[],"npcs_add":[]}
```

### Turn 40 [PLAYER]

I put three tight shots into the amber puck to silence it, then bark down the lane, “Dock Guard—BACK OFF the hatch! Next gadget that rolls in gets you shot with it.”

I rip a strip of foil tape from my kit and slap it over my helmet’s external mic port to damp the ultrasonic bite, then settle back into my hard angle with the rifle trained on the widened seam, waiting for whatever’s inside to try it.

*Agent reasoning: That chirping puck is a sensor/sonic denial tool and it’s wedged in my lane—kill it fast. Then I need eyes on the seam in case something tries to probe through, and I want Dock Guard to stop feeding the liaison gadgets.*

### Turn 41 [GAME]

Three shots crack down the hatch lane.

The first round punches the amber puck and it sparks, the chirp warbling. The second shatters the housing; the light dies. The third skips off the hatch ring with a sharp *ping* and disappears into the tube.

The ultrasonic bite in your teeth eases immediately—replaced by the normal thin whistle of air and the distant station alarm loop Pell injected, still stuttering through the comm.

Your shout carries.

For a second there’s only breathing and the clatter of someone stumbling backward. Dock Guard #2 comes back, voice strained and close to the mic like he’s crouched behind something: “Copy—copy. We’re backing off. I’ve got one down and—” He cuts himself off, swallowing. “There’s… something in here with us. I can’t see it. It’s—” His channel pops and drops into static again, like someone yanked the line.

You slap foil tape over your external mic port. Your own breathing dulls, and the station noise becomes slightly muffled—usable, but blunted.

At the widened seam, the thin ribbon of vapor stops drifting and starts pulsing—puff… pause… puff—like someone on the other side is modulating the gap with pressure.

Then the oil-black smear you saw earlier begins to *move*. Not run—*creep*, as if the residue is being drawn along the metal by an unseen finger. It drags itself into a shape: a partial handprint, then a second beside it, placed carefully, like someone testing the edge.

A tool doesn’t come through.

Instead, a single gloved fingertip—pale fabric over something too rigid—presses into the gap from the derelict side. It probes once, slow, feeling for the puck’s carcass, for the metal lip, for you.

And from the dock side of the tube, something *scrapes* along the inside wall—close enough that you hear it as vibration through the bulkhead—moving away from the hatch mouth toward the station, as if whatever Dock Guard #2 sensed is repositioning to flank from *your* side.

The immediate threats are now split: one probe at the seam from inside the derelict, and an unseen presence in the boarding tube on the station side, closing distance out of your line of sight.

```json
{"inventory_add":[],"inventory_remove":[],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":[],"npcs_add":[]}

### Turn 42 [PLAYER]

I snap one shot at the probing fingertip through the seam, then immediately peel off the angle and move down the corridor toward the station-side scrape, rifle up. “Show yourself—now—or I start stitching the walls.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m getting flanked on the station side; I can’t hold this angle and watch the seam. I’ll disable the probing finger fast, then reposition to cover the approach and force the unseen thing to show itself.*

### Turn 43 [GAME]

Your shot takes the fingertip clean.

The round cracks through the narrow gap with a shower of bright filings. The probing digit jerks back so hard it scrapes the seam—leaving a short, wet-looking streak of that oil-black residue. There’s no yelp. No curse. Just a soft *tap*—like knuckle on metal—answered by a second tap deeper inside the derelict, as if something relayed the signal.

You peel off the hard angle and move down the corridor toward the station-side scrape.

Two steps in, your visor catches motion at floor level: a thin, translucent filament stretched across the corridor at shin height—almost invisible except where it beads condensation. You hit it with your boot.

It *snaps* and a small canister the size of your thumb, magneted to the bulkhead, pops and vents a tight cone of glittering particulate into the air—micro-chaff. It blooms fast, clinging to your suit and visor like frost-dust.

Your HUD stutters. Range marks jitter. The corridor’s emergency strips smear into doubled lines for a second.

From ahead—station side—you get your answer: a figure resolves through the chaff at the corridor bend, low and wrong, not in a suit silhouette you recognize. Something drags along the deck with a dry scrape: metal on metal. It doesn’t step into the light so much as *interrupt* it.

Dock Guard #2’s voice blasts back into your muffled comm, panicked and too loud: “IT’S RIGHT—” The rest is swallowed by a strangled grunt and a heavy impact, like a body hitting the tube wall.

The figure in the corridor tilts its head toward that sound, then toward you. A flat reflective patch—visor or faceplate—catches the pulsing strip light and flashes your own outline back at you.

It raises an arm. In its hand: a cutter head or pry tool—something salvage-grade—held like a weapon, but it doesn’t rush. It advances one slow step, dragging the metal edge behind it to keep that scrape constant, measuring distance by sound.

You’ve got chaff fouling your sensors, an unknown hostile between you and the station-side tube, and Dock Guard #2 has just been grabbed or slammed hard enough to cut his transmission.

```json

```

### Turn 44 [PLAYER]

“Wrong corridor.”

I yank a flash charge and bounce it low off the deck toward the bend, then surge forward right behind the pop—rifle up for center-mass, ready to transition to a buttstroke if it closes.

*Agent reasoning: Sensors are compromised and it’s advancing by sound; I’ll go loud and brutal—flash it, then close and put it down before it reaches me or hits the guards.*

### Turn 45 [GAME]

The flash charge skitters where you sent it, a low bounce off the deck, sliding into the chaff-hazed bend.

It pops with a brutal white bloom that fills the corridor and turns the emergency strips into afterimages. Your visor auto-dims a fraction late; for half a second you’re blind anyway.

When your sight snaps back, the figure at the bend is no longer where it was.

You surged forward right behind the pop—fast, committed—and you run into something hard at chest height. Not a body: a length of salvage cable strung across the corridor, now visible because the flash lit the condensation on it. It catches your rifle and slams it sideways into the bulkhead with a metallic *clang* that echoes down the hull.

At the same moment, the “scrape” you were tracking shifts—now behind you, closer to Dock 9. The sound wasn’t the figure dragging metal forward; it was metal being dragged along the deck to *mask movement* and pull your attention.

A shape detaches from the shadowed recess beside the bend—right where your flash would force you to look past it. It comes in low and fast, using the cable as a guide. You glimpse a reflective faceplate and a forearm with a salvage pry tool, but the motion is practiced: it doesn’t swing for your head, it hooks for your weapon.

The pry tool bites under your rifle’s fore-end and wrenches. Your grip holds, but the muzzle is levered off center-mass and up toward the ceiling. The hostile uses that moment to shoulder in, trying to jam you into the bulkhead and take away your range.

Down the lane toward the tube, Dock Guard #2’s comm—still partially muffled by your taped mic—bursts with a wet gasp and a single word: “Mara—” then a thud, and silence.

Immediate threat: you’re in a clinch at arm’s length with an unknown hostile actively trying to disarm you, your rifle pinned off-target by leverage, with a trip-cable at your chest limiting your movement and a second threat implied behind you near Dock 9.

### Turn 46 [PLAYER]

I let the rifle go limp for a split second and drive my knee up hard into its midsection, then stomp back to clear space and slash my combat knife across the salvage cable at chest height. “Try that again and I’ll take the arm off.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m not winning a tug-of-war on a pinned rifle; I need to break the clinch fast and make space. I’ll use brute force—drop my weight, cut the cable, and go for a disabling strike.*

### Turn 47 [GAME]

You go limp on the rifle for a heartbeat—just enough that the hostile’s pry leverage overcommits.

Your knee comes up hard into its midsection.

Impact lands on something rigid under the suit—plate or tool harness—not flesh. It still works: the figure hitches, weight coming off you, and the pry tool slips a fraction. You feel the rifle free up in your hands again.

But the hostile answers instantly. It doesn’t grunt—it *clicks*, a short mechanical sound through the faceplate, and drives its shoulder into you as it recovers, trying to keep you pinned.

You stomp back, forcing a sliver of space, and your knife flashes up to the salvage cable at chest height.

The blade bites—and skates.

The cable isn’t soft wire. It’s braided salvage line with a ceramic core; you score it, fray a few strands, but it doesn’t part. The recoil of the cut vibrates up your arm.

The hostile uses that vibration like a cue. Its free hand snaps out and clamps your knife wrist—glove on glove, grip like a clamp—then twists, not to take the knife, but to angle it *into the cable*.

You feel the line tighten. The hostile is trying to turn your own cut into a saw, to pull you forward into the tension point.

Behind you, toward Dock 9, the scrape returns—closer now, steady and deliberate. Something is approaching from the tube side, and it’s using the deck to announce itself.

The figure in front of you tilts its reflective faceplate inches from yours. In the flash-dim light, your visor catches a smear on its faceplate: an oil-black handprint, placed where your own palm would land if you pushed it away.

It speaks in a voice that doesn’t match the body—flat, filtered, familiar in the wrong way: “You always threaten the arm.”

Then it yanks the cable.

Not to choke you—low enough to catch your rifle and forearms—trying to trap weapon and knife-hand together as the second presence closes from behind.

### Turn 48 [PLAYER]

I drop my weight hard to duck under the cable tension, then twist my knife wrist inward and drive the blade into its gripping forearm at the joint to make it let go. As soon as it loosens, I shove off the bulkhead, bring my rifle back up, and fire two rounds center-mass while backpedaling to keep both threats in front of me. “Pell—where’s the second one, now!”

*Agent reasoning: I’m getting trapped between the cable and a second threat; talking is pointless. I need space and a hard stop—drop weight, break the wrist grip, and put rounds into something vital before the rear threat arrives.*

### Turn 49 [GAME]

You drop your weight to slip under the cable’s bite. It works—your shoulders clear the line and the tension loses its leverage on your forearms.

Your knife wrist twists inward and you drive the blade into the hostile’s gripping forearm at the joint.

The knife goes in with a gritty *crunch*—not bone. Composite. The suit fabric puckers and then *weeps* oil-black fluid that beads instead of spraying. The clamp-grip loosens immediately; the hand opens like it lost power. The figure recoils a half-step, forearm twitching in small, wrong pulses.

You shove off the bulkhead, rip your rifle back into your shoulder, and fire two rounds center-mass.

Both shots land. The impacts kick up sparks and dark flecks off its torso plating. The figure staggers but doesn’t fold; it absorbs the hits with a stiff, delayed sway, then re-centers itself like it’s correcting balance rather than reacting to pain.

You backpedal to keep the bend and Dock 9 in front of you—

—and your heel hits the feathered frost at the right-hand seam.

The deck bites back. Ice blooms around your boot in a fast, white flower, anchoring you. The seam exhales a needle-cold gust that needles into suit joints; your ankle goes numb in a heartbeat and your balance yanks sideways. Something in the wall shifts with the sound of wet fabric peeling free.

On the bulkhead beside you—right where the frost feathers out—those oily fingerprints aren’t just stains anymore. A thin sheet of black slough peels off the wall like skin coming unstuck, sliding toward your trapped ankle.

Ahead, the shot figure raises its pry tool again, one-handed now, and starts forward—slow, deliberate—while behind it, near Dock 9, the scrape you heard becomes a *dragging step*. A second silhouette edges into view through the chaff haze, staying just out of the light.

Your comm crackles as you bark for Pell. His reply comes late and tight, like he’s speaking with someone else in the room: “Vance, I don’t have— I don’t have a ‘second.’ Get back to the tube. Now.”

Your boot is freezing into the deck, the wall-slough is reaching for your ankle, and you’ve got at least two hostiles in the corridor—one wounded, one closing from the tube side.

### Turn 50 [PLAYER]

I drop to a knee and dump a burst into the ice blooming around my boot and the peeling black slough on the wall, then yank my leg free even if it rips the boot seal. I snap a shot at the wounded one’s faceplate to slow it, then start falling back toward the tube. “Pell—open the inner door and vent this damn corridor, now!”

*Agent reasoning: I’m getting pinned by the environment with two hostiles closing; I need mobility first, then I’ll force a retreat path with violence.*

### Turn 51 [GAME]

You drop to a knee, rifle braced, and dump a burst at your boot.

Rounds chew the ice bloom into powder and steaming chips. The frost sheath fractures—but the cold seam under it *answers*: the split in the bulkhead exhales again, and the ice tries to re-knit even as you’re destroying it.

You rake the same burst across the peeling black slough on the wall. It reacts like wet fabric and hot tar at once—puckering, snapping back, and then *splattering* in thick droplets that slap your shin and the deck. Where the droplets land, the frost feathers harder, faster.

You yank your leg free.

The boot seal tears with a sharp rip. Your suit screams a pressure warning in your ear; a thin, painful cold knifes into your foot. You’re mobile again, but your right boot is compromised—every step leaves a faint mist of escaping air and a spreading rim of rime around your tread.

You snap a shot at the wounded one’s faceplate.

The round hits dead center. The reflective plate spiders, then caves inward. For a split second you see something behind it that isn’t a face—just layered dark material and a pale, wet glint like an eye under oil. The figure recoils, head snapping back, and it *stutters* in place like its balance logic just got scrambled.

From the tube side, the second silhouette breaks into a run—low, fast, closing the distance while you’re still down on one knee. You can see its hands now: both empty, palms out, like it wants to grab rather than strike.

You start falling back toward Dock 9.

Pell comes back over comm, voice strained: “I can’t vent a dock corridor from my end—station interlocks. If I crack the inner door without equalizing, port security will lock it and flag you. You want air moving? You have to give me a reason the system accepts.”

As you retreat, the bulkhead panel marked B-12 to your left—half hidden under grime and frost—gives a tiny internal *click*. At knee height, a “cable grommet” dilates into a dark aperture.

A narrow muzzle tracks your centerline.

A tight, synthetic voice issues from nowhere in particular: “AUDIO PATTERN MATCH. COMPLIANCE REQUIRED.”

The sentry node is live, aimed to rake the corridor at knee-to-hip height—right through your compromised boot line—while one hostile recovers ahead and the second closes from behind.

### Turn 52 [PLAYER]

I pivot on my knee and mag-dump into the B-12 grommet muzzle until it stops tracking, then slap my emergency beacon and bark, “Station security—active hostile boarding, weapons fire at Dock 9 corridor! Initiate emergency vent and lockdown!”  

I rise and drive straight at the closer empty-handed runner with a rifle-butt smash to the faceplate/neck line to drop it, then keep moving toward the tube, muzzle snapping back to the wounded one for a finishing shot if it twitches. “Pell—crack the inner door on my mark. I’m giving you your damn reason.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m boxed in—two hostiles and now a sentry. I need to remove the gun immediately and create a “reason” the station will accept to vent/equalize. Fast violence, then force the system with a fire/decon trigger.*

### Turn 53 [GAME]

You pivot on your knee and hose the B‑12 aperture.

The muzzle tries to track through the first half-second—then your rounds find the mechanism. The “grommet” ruptures in a spray of brittle polymer and sparks. Something inside pops with a wet, electrical snap; the tracking stutters, then goes slack. The synthetic voice cuts mid-syllable.

Your emergency beacon chirps as it goes live. You bark into it—*boarding, weapons fire, Dock 9*—

A faint click rides the hull groan, like a pen tapping glass. The emergency strip-lights desync for a beat, then resettle. Somewhere in the corridor metal, a soft tone pulses—an acknowledgement ping—too clean to be random. Your message went out, but something else just timestamped your voice.

Station security answers a second later, cool and procedural: “Dock Nine corridor, identify. Transmit biometrics and stand by for containment response.”

Containment. Not rescue.

You rise and drive straight into the closer runner.

It’s faster than it looked. It dips under your first swing by inches, then surges up into it anyway, accepting the hit to close distance. Your rifle butt smashes its faceplate/neck line with a hard *thunk*—the plate cracks, and its head snaps sideways. It goes down to one knee, hands still reaching, but it doesn’t sprawl; it’s already trying to stand again, movements jerky like a puppet yanked by a single string.

You keep moving toward the tube, muzzle snapping back to the wounded one.

The first hostile—faceplate caved—twitches, then raises its pry tool again with its good arm. It turns its shattered “face” toward your compromised boot and starts forward, dragging the tool tip to throw sparks and noise.

Pell comes on comm, breathing hard: “I heard the beacon. Inner door interlocks just flipped to *security authority*. I can’t override once they take it—Vance, you just handed them the corridor.”

Ahead, at the tube end, the inner door’s status light changes from Helix amber to station-white. A lock clunks into place.

Over the beacon, the same security voice: “Mara Vance, service ID recognized. Remain where you are. Lethal discharge authorized if you approach the inner door.”

You’re between two not-quite-human hostiles in the corridor, with a compromised boot seal, the sentry node disabled but the station now actively locking you out—and security has your name and a green light to stop you.

I grab the kneeling runner by the collar/helmet seam and haul it up in front of me as a shield, rifle jammed over its shoulder. Into the beacon: “Security—two hostiles on me, nonhuman, your containment order will get people killed; open the inner door or I start putting rounds through your lock and anyone behind it.”  

I back up fast toward the nearest maintenance panel/side hatch by the tube end, kick and rip for an emergency release while keeping the runner between me and the door, then fire a short, controlled burst into the wounded pry-tool one’s legs to slow it. “Pell—tell me there’s a service crawl or manual override on this side, now.”

*Agent reasoning: Security’s not helping and the door’s locked; I need a human shield and a new exit. I’ll grab the runner, force it between me and the tube cameras, and use it to bait security into opening or at least hesitating while I breach an alternate access panel.*

I haul the kneeling runner up by the helmet seam and keep it between me and the inner door, rifle braced over its shoulder. Into the beacon: “Security—two nonhuman hostiles in Dock 9 corridor; open the inner door or I’ll shoot the lock and anyone stacked behind it.”  

I backpedal to the nearest maintenance panel by the tube end, kick for an emergency release and start ripping it open one-handed, runner still as my shield. I snap a short burst into the pry-tool hostile’s legs to slow it, then bark, “Pell—service crawl or manual override on my side, now—talk.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m not trusting station security or that locked inner door—force a new route. Use the runner as a shield, cripple the pry-tool one, and rip open a maintenance access to bypass the checkpoint while Pell looks for a manual override.*

### Turn 57 [GAME]

You hook fingers under the runner’s helmet seam and haul.

It comes up too easily—light for its size—and it doesn’t fight like a person. Its hands scrabble at your forearm with a weak, repetitive grip as you wrench it in front of you. The cracked faceplate is close enough that you can see the “inside” isn’t a face so much as layered black membrane and cabling, slick with condensation.

You key the beacon and threaten the door.

Station security doesn’t argue. The reply is immediate and flat: “Threat acknowledged. Lethal authorization confirmed.” A half-second later, the inner door’s status light shifts again—white to hard red—and you hear boots thump into position on the other side, then the whine of a weapon charging.

You backpedal to the tube-end maintenance panel—stenciled **NODE 3A-19**—and slam a boot into the latch.

The panel doesn’t spring. It flexes, then *sticks* like it’s been glued from the inside. When you get fingers under the edge and rip, it peels open with a tearing sound—and a ribbon of oil-black residue stretches between panel and frame like sinew before snapping. Cold vapor spills out in a steady breath.

Inside is a narrow service chase, but it’s not dark: a dim diagnostic LED blinks, and something pale moves just out of sight, deeper in—slow, deliberate, like a hand withdrawing.

You snap a controlled burst into the pry-tool hostile’s legs.

Rounds impact. Its shin plating punches inward; one knee buckles. It drops hard, tool clattering, but it doesn’t scream. It immediately starts dragging itself forward anyway, arms pulling with ugly efficiency, head tipped toward your leaking boot like it’s following the sound of your suit venting.

Behind your shield, the inner door *clangs*—a test hit from the other side, like someone shouldering it to see if it’ll give. Then a voice, closer now through the metal: “Vance, release the hostage and step away from the hatch.”

Pell answers your barked question, voice tight: “There’s a manual dog on the *station* side—nothing on yours. But NODE 3A should tie into a crawl that runs under the tube collar. If you can get into that chase, you might bypass the inner door—might. Mara… I’m seeing your biometrics pinging twice on the station net. That’s not you.”

The runner you’re holding suddenly goes rigid. Its head tilts, and from inside its broken faceplate you hear a thin, wet clicking—like it’s trying to speak through fluid.

Then the corridor lights dip again, and your black-box canister in your pouch *hums* hard enough to numb your ribs through the suit.

### Turn 58 [PLAYER]

I slam the runner headfirst into the inner door to make the boots behind it flinch, then dump it aside and fire a burst at the door’s status panel/lock seam to blind their sensors. “Pell, patch my feed—if you see ‘me’ anywhere else, shoot it.”

I rip the black-box canister out, shove it deep into NODE 3A-19 as a distraction, then dive into the service chase feet-first, swinging my rifle back toward the corridor to put two rounds into the crawling pry-tool thing’s head if it keeps coming.

*Agent reasoning: Security’s about to light me up and the “hostage” isn’t human—keeping it is a liability. The crawl is my only exit, and the humming canister means this is escalating fast. I’ll use violence to buy seconds and get into the chase.*

I rip the humming black-box canister out and jam it deep into NODE 3A-19, then dive feet-first into the service chase; as I drop in, I twist back and put two rounds into the crawling pry-tool thing’s head if it keeps coming.

*Agent reasoning: Security’s about to breach and the hostiles don’t stop unless I destroy the head; the service chase is my only bypass, and the humming black-box is screaming “bait.” I’m forcing a gap, blinding the door, then diving into the crawl while buying myself seconds with a headshot.*

### Turn 68 [PLAYER]

I freeze in the service chase, rifle up, and smack my visor once hard. “Pell, I’m blind—talk to me. Is my feed up, and did the door stack move?”  

I crawl deeper into the chase to get distance, then pivot to cover back down the corridor and listen for that pry-tool thing.

*Agent reasoning: I got zero visual feedback—either my feed’s dead or something’s messing with the display. I’m not sitting in a kill zone; I’m moving, checking my six, and forcing Pell to confirm what’s real.*

### Turn 69 [GAME]

Your visor flickers from static to a smeared, overexposed wash—then settles into a dull gray with only your reticle and O₂ timer still alive. The hard smack doesn’t bring the world back; it just knocks loose a tiny snow of frost from the chase ceiling.

Pell comes through, not on your normal channel at first—thin, half a second delayed, like it’s being relayed through something else.

“Mara— I’ve got *a* feed. Not clean. Your suit’s broadcasting but the image is… doubled. Hold—” A pause, keys clicking. “Door stack moved. Someone yanked the inner door and then it slammed back. I saw a body go past the seam—couldn’t tell if it was your runner or—” He swallows audibly. “—or you.”

You crawl deeper. The service chase is tight enough your rifle scrapes conduit housings; your shoulder bumps a junction box marked **3A-19** in flaking stencil. The hum in your gloves is gone—either the canister’s seated and insulated, or the chase metal is eating the vibration.

Behind you, from the corridor you dropped out of, the sound comes: a dry, patient *tck… tck… tck*, like a tool testing the same spot again and again. Then a longer drag—metal teeth worrying at the chase lip where you entered.

As you pivot to cover the opening, your gray visor briefly overlays a ghost image: a silhouette of you, crouched in the corridor outside the chase, rifle up, looking straight into the access. It’s there for less than a second—then it snaps back to blank gray.

Pell’s voice tightens. “Mara, don’t move— I’m seeing you in two places again. One’s in the chase—one’s outside it, aiming in. Which one is you? Say something only you’d know.”

The *tcking* stops. In the silence, something breathes just once—too close to be down the corridor. Right at the edge of the access, a narrow, jointed shape slides into the opening like a forearm made of pry-tools, ending in a blunt “head” with a lens-like pit that catches your suit light and doesn’t reflect it back.

### Turn 70 [PLAYER]

“Pell—Kharon breach. Black snow. You dragged me out by my collar and the brass blamed me. That’s your proof.”

I fire a tight two-round burst straight into the lens-pit “head,” then kick hard at the jointed arm to knock it out of the opening as I back-crawl deeper, rifle still trained on the access.

*Agent reasoning: I’m not letting a mimic get Pell to hesitate; I need to prove identity fast and then kill the thing in the access before it wedges in.*

### Turn 71 [GAME]

“Kharon breach. Black snow. You dragged me out—”

Pell answers instantly, voice breaking with recognition. “That’s you. That’s *you*. Okay—okay. I’m locking the other feed out. Hold—”

You squeeze off two tight rounds.

In the cramped chase the muzzle flash is a white slap; the shots hit the lens-pit dead-on. The “head” doesn’t explode like flesh—your rounds punch through with a brittle *crack* and a spray of glittering shards that ring off the chase walls. For a fraction of a second the pit lights from within, like a camera sensor overloading, and then it goes dark.

The jointed arm convulses. Your boot connects hard at the first elbow-joint and you feel it give—not bone, more like a composite strut snapping. The arm whips back out of the opening with a scraping yank that peels a strip of metal from the chase lip.

You back-crawl deeper, rifle steady on the access.

Consequence: it’s not gone.

From the corridor side, something drags the damaged arm away, and you hear the pry-tool thing reposition—multiple contact points now, faster, more coordinated. The access frame shudders as if it’s testing leverage for a rip rather than a reach.

Pell again, more focused. “Door stack— they’re not pushing in anymore. They’re backing off. Wait—” His breath catches. “No, one stayed. I’ve got heat at the access. And Mara— the other ‘you’ just turned its head toward Dock 9 like it heard me.”

Your visor throws another ghost overlay: the corridor outside, empty—then a single oil-black handprint appears on the *inside* edge of the access frame, fingers splayed as if something just pulled itself close. The print is real; you can see it in the suit light, glossy against frost.

Then the pry-tool thing makes a new sound—wet and electrical—like a taser arcing in coolant. The access screws begin to *walk* out of their threads one by one, not falling, but rotating as if turned by invisible fingertips.

It’s trying to take the whole frame off.

### Turn 72 [PLAYER]

I snarl and slap a strip of emergency sealant tape over the nearest seam and screw heads, then ram my combat knife into the frame gap like a wedge. Into comms: “Pell, kill power to this section—3A-19 chase access, now. If you can’t, vent the corridor outside it.”

*Agent reasoning: It’s unscrewing the frame—if it opens this chase, I’m trapped. I need to deny access fast and force a fight on my terms, while getting Pell to cut power if he can.*

### Turn 73 [GAME]

You slap the emergency sealant tape down over the seam and two of the walking screw heads. It adheres—then immediately puckers as something underneath keeps turning. The tape stretches, goes glossy, and a thin spiral tear forms where the screw continues to rotate, chewing its way through the adhesive.

You drive your combat knife into the frame gap as a wedge. The blade bites metal with a hard *clink* and holds. For half a second the access stops shuddering.

Then the frame pulls—not outward, but *sideways*, as if the force is coming from an angle down the corridor. Your knife bends a few degrees with a protesting creak. The wedge slows the removal, but it doesn’t stop it.

In comms: “Pell, kill power—3A-19—now. If you can’t, vent the corridor outside it.”

Pell doesn’t answer right away. You hear him moving, breath close to the mic, then a sharp shout away from his handset—“I need a hard cut on Dock 9 aux, now—!” A different voice barks back, distant and tinny through his open channel: “That’ll trip the whole spine, we—”

Pell comes back, low and urgent. “I can try. But Mara—Admiralty safeties won’t let me vent a live dock corridor without an override. And the override request pings their office.”

Outside the access, the taser-in-coolant sound intensifies. The metal around your taped screws starts to frost over in a perfect ring, as if heat is being pulled out of it. The tape stiffens and cracks. One screw head pops free with a soft *tink* and floats for a heartbeat—then shoots sideways, yanked out of view.

The oil-black handprint on the inner edge *smears* upward, though nothing touches it. A second print appears beside it, smaller, fingers too long.

Your knife wedge suddenly loses purchase—*not* because it slips, but because the gap widens around it by a millimeter, metal deforming like it’s been softened. The frame is being “unmade” at the seam.

Pell again, strained. “Attempting section cut. If it works you’ll lose suit relay and lights in that run. Three seconds—”

The access gives a sharp, decisive *snap* as the top-left corner breaks free. The frame tilts inward toward you, opening a black triangular gap big enough for that jointed arm—and something behind it—to push through.

### Turn 74 [PLAYER]

I rip the knife free and unload a short burst into the black triangular gap, then stomp-kick the loosening frame to jam it crooked and buy a second. “Pell, do it—kill the section!” I back-crawl fast to the next junction/bend and brace there, rifle leveled on the access, ready to fire the moment anything pushes through.

*Agent reasoning: The frame’s giving way; I can’t let it get a grip inside the chase. I’ll use brute force—shoot, stomp, and retreat to a tighter bend—while Pell cuts power to disrupt whatever’s “unmaking” the seam.*

I rip my knife free, dump a short burst into the triangular gap, then stomp-kick the frame to jam it crooked. “Pell, now—kill 3A-19!” I back-crawl to the next bend, plant my boots, and hold the access at gunpoint, firing at the first thing that breaches.

*Agent reasoning: The feed cut out mid-contact; I need immediate control of the choke point and I’m not waiting for visuals—use sound and force, then force Pell to execute the power kill.*

### Turn 77 [GAME]

You wrench the knife free—metal squeals—and fire a tight burst into the triangular gap.

The rounds hit something just inside: not a body, not plating. It sparks like you’re chewing through a wet circuit board. Blue-white arcing crawls across the gap, and a thin spray of black droplets splatters the inside lip of the frame and floats in slow beads. The arcing sound cuts out for a beat, like you stunned whatever was “holding” the seam.

You stomp-kick the loosening frame. The corner you’d broken free skews inward and jams crooked against the chase wall with a grinding *chonk*. The opening deforms—smaller, irregular—no longer a clean triangle. For a second, it holds.

“Pell, now—kill 3A-19!”

Pell’s reply comes clipped and immediate. “Doing it—stand by—”

You back-crawl hard to the next bend/junction and brace your boots. Rifle up, sight line pinned on the access down the run.

Three seconds stretch.

Then the section dies.

Your suit lights flicker once and go to dim emergency. The chase’s strip lighting goes out entirely. Your comms drop into a thin, degraded carrier—Pell’s voice turns warbly, full of gaps. “—cut— you’re dark—”

In the sudden near-black, the jammed frame at 3A-19 makes a slow, deliberate *click… click… click* as if something is testing it with fingertip taps.

A new sound joins it: a soft scrape moving along the inside of the chase toward you, not from the access—*from the corridor side route*, using the duct walls like a guide. It’s closing, steady and patient.

At the access, something presses into the crooked opening. Not the jointed arm this time—something flatter, like a hand trying to become a shape it remembers. The jam holds, but the metal around it dimples inward.

Your visor IR tries to compensate and catches a smear of colder-than-ambient shadow sliding along the chase ceiling toward your bend. It’s not heat; it’s absence, a moving patch where the sensor can’t resolve.

Pell’s broken audio hisses: “—Mara— it rerouted— not in the frame— it’s in the—”

The scrape is now within a few meters, above you, and a single black droplet lands on your forearm plate with a quiet *tick*, then begins to spread as if looking for seams.

I hiss and scrape the black droplet off my forearm with my knife, then hit it with a quick burst from my suit’s emergency microtorch until it chars or flakes. 

“Pell—whatever it is, it’s in the chase with me. Give me the next junction map—nearest hatch I can dog shut?” I back-crawl hard through the bend, then spin and fire a short burst up at the ceiling-shadow, trying to make it back off while I shove for the next access I can slam closed.

*Agent reasoning: It’s bypassing the access and coming through the chase itself; I need distance and a hard barrier. The black droplet is a breach risk, so I burn it off and move fast to a junction I can seal.*

I scrape the black droplet off my forearm with my knife and hit it with a quick blast from my suit’s microtorch until it chars or flakes. “Pell—it's in the chase with me. Feed me the junction map; nearest hatch I can dog shut, now.” I back-crawl through the bend, then whip around and dump a short burst into the ceiling-shadow to make it back off while I shove for the next access I can slam closed.

*Agent reasoning: That black droplet is trying to crawl into seams—burn it off fast. Then I need hard terrain advantage: a hatch I can dog shut and a map from Pell. The ceiling-shadow is closing, so I’ll shoot to force distance while I move.*

### Turn 81 [GAME]

You hook the knife edge under the black droplet and scrape. It comes off in a tacky smear, resisting like chewed resin, and leaves a faint dark stain in the micro-scratches of your forearm plate.

You thumb your suit’s emergency microtorch and kiss the smear with a tight blue flame. It doesn’t flare like oil— it *tightens*. The blackness puckers, goes matte, then cracks into thin flakes that curl away from the heat. Underneath, your armor’s finish is etched: a spiderweb of hairline pits, like it tried to find a way through and got cooked mid-bite.

The torch’s hiss gives you away.

Above you, the ceiling-shadow reacts: it “unhooks” from the duct ceiling in a way your eyes can’t track cleanly, and the IR void slides fast—too fast—toward the bend you’re retreating through.

“Pell—it's in the chase with me. Feed me the junction map; nearest hatch I can dog shut, now.”

Static, then Pell, broken and urgent: “I’ve got partial— 3A spine is dark and looping. Nearest doggable is a maintenance iris at NODE 3A-21— two junctions forward, starboard-side access. Manual dogs. But— Mara— your beacon’s ghosting. I’m seeing *two* of you.”

You back-crawl through the bend, then whip around and dump a short burst into the ceiling-void.

The rounds don’t spark off metal. They *vanish* into that absence with dull little thuds, like firing into packed insulation. For half a second the void shreds—its edge frays into wisps that your visor can suddenly resolve as fine, filament-like strands clinging to the ductwork.

Then it snaps back together and drops lower.

A strip of it lashes down and catches your rifle’s barrel. Not a tentacle—more like a sheet trying to become a grip. The weapon yanks sideways hard enough to wrench your shoulder; your muzzle skates and the burst walks into the wall.

You shove for the next access as Pell’s map pings a faint overlay: the next junction is ahead, with a starboard maintenance iris marked **3A-21**.

Behind you, at the bend you just cleared, the duct wall *dents inward* with a slow palm-press—five shallow depressions forming, then sliding along the metal toward you as if something is “crawling” without limbs. The pressure builds near your boots.

The threat is in the chase with you now—moving by adhesion and pressure along surfaces—and it has physical leverage on your weapon.

### Turn 82 [PLAYER]

I snarl and jam the microtorch onto the sheet gripping my rifle barrel, cooking it until it peels or cracks free, then wrench the rifle back hard. “Pell, I don’t care about the ghost—stay on my signal and mark 3A-21 manual dogs.” I lunge to the maintenance iris, yank it open just enough to slip through, then spin and start dogging it shut fast, torch ready to burn anything that tries to squeeze in the seam.

*Agent reasoning: It’s grabbing my rifle and closing—fire’s the only thing that made it react. I need to break contact, burn it off the barrel, and slam that iris shut to isolate it.*

### Turn 83 [GAME]

You jam the microtorch straight onto the black sheet gripping your rifle barrel.

It reacts instantly—no flare, no smoke at first—just a sharp *snap-pop* like overloaded insulation. The sheet whitens at the point of contact, goes brittle, and cracks outward in branching lines. A sour, metallic stink floods your helmet filters. The grip loosens in a stuttering way, trying to re-form around the heat, but the torch keeps it from sealing.

You wrench the rifle back hard. The cracked material tears free in a ribbon and slaps against the duct wall, where it clings and twitches like it’s still deciding what shape to be. Your barrel is left with a dull, etched band and a few pits—cosmetic now, but it’s been chemically kissed.

“Pell, I don’t care about the ghost—stay on my signal and mark 3A-21 manual dogs.”

Pell comes back through a thin carrier, breath audible. “Copy. 3A-21 is a two-dog iris—opposed cams. Manual only. Mara—your signal just *spiked* when you torched it. Someone else is listening on the line—can’t tell who.”

You lunge to the maintenance iris. In the dark you find the recessed handhold, yank—metal squeals—and the iris gives you a tight crescent opening. You shoulder through, scraping plates, and whip around inside the small maintenance pocket beyond.

As you start dogging it shut, the thing hits the seam.

Not as a limb—as pressure. The iris shudders and rebounds against your hands. Black filaments push into the narrowing gap like wet hair seeking airflow. You torch the seam: the filaments recoil, turning pale and brittle at the edge, flaking into drifting ash-like specks.

But the iris doesn’t close clean.

One filament gets past before you can seal it—thin as wire—and it anchors on the inside lip. You feel it through your glove as a faint vibration, like a live cable under tension. The manual dog wheel fights you, grinding as if grit is in the cam track.

You get the first dog halfway seated. The second won’t bite fully; something is *in the track*.

Outside the iris, the duct wall dents again—five depressions—then slides away, repositioning. The pressure is no longer at the seam; it’s moving to find another weak point.

Inside the pocket with you: a single black filament, anchored and quivering, beginning to spread along the iris rim toward the dog mechanism.

### Turn 84 [PLAYER]

I torch the anchored filament point-blank until it flakes, then slam my knife tip into the dog track and scrape/pry the grit out. “Pell—someone’s on the line. Ignore it. Tell me if this pocket has a purge port or anything I can vent.” I heave my weight into the second dog wheel, forcing it to bite, and keep the torch aimed at the seam for any hairline push-through.

*Agent reasoning: The filament is the foothold; if it reaches the dog mechanism I’m done. Burn it, then brute-force the stuck cam and seal the iris, even if I have to damage it.*

### Turn 85 [GAME]

You put the microtorch right onto the anchored filament.

It doesn’t just curl away—at that heat, it *fails*. The filament turns chalk-white along a finger-length, fractures, and sheds in brittle flakes that patter onto the deck like burnt plastic. The vibration in your glove stops. What’s left on the iris lip is a faint, glossy stain and a line of tiny pits where it had “bitten” into the metal.

You jam your knife tip into the dog track and scrape.

The “grit” isn’t dust. It comes out in clotted granules—black, beadlike, slightly elastic. As you pry, it tries to cling to the knife like tack. You flick it off, then scrape again until the cam channel shows bare metal.

Outside the seam, something presses once—hard—then slides away, as if it felt the seal firm up and decided not to waste mass there.

“Pell—someone’s on the line. Ignore it. Tell me if this pocket has a purge port or anything I can vent.”

Pell: “Maintenance pockets usually have a purge stub—look for a capped valve, yellow ring. But—Mara—there’s a second carrier tone riding your comm. Not voice. Like a… handshake. It’s pinging every time you use heat.”

You heave your weight into the second dog wheel.

This time it bites. The wheel grinds, then cams over with a solid, ugly *clunk*. The iris settles into its seat. The seam tightens to a thin line.

You keep the torch aimed at the perimeter. For a few seconds nothing pushes through—no hair, no filaments—just the faint tick of cooling metal and your own breath.

Then the iris *rings* once, resonant, like someone tapped it from the other side with a knuckle.

A beat later: a slow, spreading pressure along the outer rim—testing. Not forcing the seam now; feeling for the dogs, for the mechanism you just cleared.

Inside the pocket, your suit HUD pings a micropressure change—slight, localized—near the back wall. You turn and see it: a capped valve with a yellow ring, half-hidden behind a conduit bundle. The cap is filmed over with a thin black sheen, like someone painted it with oil and let it dry.

The threat outside has stopped trying to squeeze in. It’s moved to *working the door*—and whatever’s on that purge valve looks like it got there before you did.

### Turn 86 [PLAYER]

I stomp over and torch the black sheen on the purge cap until it cracks and flakes, then I rip my knife across it to clear the ring and get metal. “Pell—on my mark, kill any life support feed to this pocket and confirm where it vents—space or back into the chase?”  

I grab the yellow-ring cap and start wrenching it open, keeping my shoulder against the iris and my rifle pointed at it in case it pops or the dogs start to slip.

*Agent reasoning: That purge valve is my leverage—either vent this pocket or blast whatever’s coating it. I’m not letting the thing “work” the dogs; I’ll change the environment fast and keep Pell focused.*

### Turn 87 [GAME]

The microtorch licks the black sheen on the purge cap. It tightens, goes matte, then fractures in a spiderweb of pale cracks. When you rake your knife across it, the coating comes off in curled flakes—revealing the yellow ring and bare metal beneath.

The smell is immediate: hot polymer and a faint ammonia bite that your filters flag as “unknown irritant.”

“Pell—on my mark, kill any life support feed to this pocket and confirm where it vents—space or back into the chase?”

Pell answers fast, breathy. “Stand by. I’m querying station-side schematics through Helix—” a pause, a soft click like someone else joining the line, “—I don’t have full authority on that pocket. Purge stubs on these old hulls *usually* vent to exterior, but some tie back into service trunks. Give me ten seconds.”

You grab the cap and wrench.

It’s stiff, like the threads have been cold-welded. You brace a shoulder into the iris—feeling the dogs vibrate under a renewed pressure from outside—and put your weight into the cap. It moves a quarter-turn with a shriek of metal, then a second quarter-turn smoother.

As the seal breaks, a thin, cold breath hisses out around the threads—air, not vacuum. Your HUD flashes: **pressure equalizing**.

The moment that hiss starts, the iris dog wheels twitch under your shoulder like something outside just felt the flow and leaned in.

Then the hiss changes pitch—lower, throatier—and you hear it: a faint, far-off *answering whistle* in the wall conduit, as if the purge line is connected to a larger run, not open space.

Pell comes back, clipped and urgent. “Mara—don’t open it fully yet. I’m seeing the purge manifold tagged to **service trunk 3A**. That’s internal. If you vent, you’re venting into the ship, not space.”

Outside, the pressure on the iris shifts from “testing” to “working.” The ring around the door flexes once. The dogs hold, but you feel the cams complain—metal-on-metal strain.

You’ve got the purge cap loosened and leaking into the pocket. It is not a clean vent to space, and whatever is outside the iris is reacting to the airflow change.

### Turn 88 [PLAYER]

I snarl and crank the purge cap back down hard until the hiss stops, then slap a strip of sealant tape over the cap seam anyway. “Pell, find me an *external* vent or an escape route out of this pocket—now. And trace that handshake; if someone’s listening, I want a name.” I plant my boots, shove my shoulder into the iris, and fire a short burst through the door’s center hub to discourage whatever’s leaning on it, then scan the pocket for a secondary access panel or crawlway out.

*Agent reasoning: Venting into the ship just feeds it a path and reacts to airflow; I need to stop the leak, reinforce the door, and get out—fast—while Pell finds an exterior vent or another route.*

### Turn 89 [GAME]

You crank the purge cap down until the threads bottom out. The hiss cuts off clean. You slap sealant tape over the seam; it adheres, but the tape puckers slightly where that oily residue stained the metal—like the adhesive doesn’t fully trust the surface.

“Pell, find me an external vent or an escape route out of this pocket—now. And trace that handshake; if someone’s listening, I want a name.”

Pell: “Working. Handshake isn’t Helix. It’s… old-format naval. Narrowband. It’s not *talking*, it’s *logging*. I can’t pull an ID, but it’s bouncing off something in the 3A trunk—like a maintenance transponder.”

You brace, shoulder into the iris, and fire a short burst into the center hub.

The rounds punch through with a brutal, muffled *THUNK-THUNK-THUNK* as they hit layered metal and whatever’s pressed against it. The iris jumps against your shoulder; the dogs hold. On the far side, you hear a wet slap and a dragging retreat—something pulled away fast.

A second later, a different sound replaces it: a thin, furious *scritching* at the seam, like hard fibers being drawn across metal. Not pushing in—scoring, probing.

Your suit’s audio picks up it up close: the scritching is moving in a circle around the hub, searching for the weak point you just perforated.

You sweep your light across the pocket. It’s a cramped service cavity: conduit bundles, a junction box, and a misaligned plate low on the right wall that doesn’t sit flush—its fasteners are half-stripped, like someone opened it in a hurry and shoved it back.

You hook a finger under the plate edge and pull. It gives with a gritty pop, revealing a shallow recess and a **Helix-branded memory puck** wedged behind it—still in a static sleeve.

As your glove clears it, your visor pings residue: **biometric echo present**—and the puck’s tiny status LED flickers once, like it woke up.

Pell, over comm, voice tight: “Mara—external vent… there’s an access crawl at the back of that pocket, should tie into the outer skin service chase. If it’s not blocked.”

The scritching at the iris stops. Immediately after, something heavy leans on the hub again—more deliberate now, centered exactly where you just shot through.

### Turn 90 [PLAYER]

I snatch the Helix memory puck and jam it into a secure thigh pouch. “Pell—route me to that back-wall crawl, now; keep your eyes on the iris in case it blows.”  

I stomp to the back-wall access, rip it open, and dive into the crawlway, then swing my rifle back and torch the entry lip as I pull the panel toward closed behind me.

*Agent reasoning: The door won’t hold forever and I just made a weak spot; I need to move. Grab the puck for leverage later, then push into the crawl access and put distance between me and that thing.*

### Turn 91 [GAME]

You snatch the Helix puck, shove it deep into your thigh pouch, and stomp for the back wall.

“Pell—route me to that back-wall crawl, now; keep your eyes on the iris in case it blows.”

Pell: “Back wall, low left—panel’s a quarter-turn latch. Mara—pressure on the iris is spiking. It’s not just leaning now, it’s—”

You find the panel: a recessed square with a single latch that *should* turn by hand. It doesn’t. The latch is tacky with the same black residue. You palm it anyway, twist hard, and it gives with a wet snap.

The panel pops inward.

Cold air rolls out—stale, metallic, and *moving*. The crawl is real, but it’s tight: a skin-chase between hull layers, lined with cable runs and a service lattice. You dive in on elbows and knees.

Behind you, the iris hub takes a sudden impact—one heavy slam that makes the whole pocket shudder. The dogs hold, but you hear a sharp *ping* like a stressed fastener shearing.

You swing the rifle back and light the torch, raking it across the entry lip as you pull the panel toward closed.

The torch bites the lip…and the black residue on the edge *wakes*—it bubbles and strings, trying to bridge the gap as the panel comes up. You burn through it, forcing the panel shut, but it doesn’t seat cleanly. A thumb-width gap remains at the bottom where something rubbery is caught in the seam.

Through that gap, a thin, precise sound: *tap…tap…tap* from the pocket side, like a tool testing the closure.

Pell, voice strained: “I’ve got no visual—your feed’s occluded—but the door pressure just dropped. Whatever was on it moved. Mara, it moved fast.”

In the crawl, above your head, something scrapes across the service lattice—metal on metal. Not the iris. Up here. Close enough that dust sifts down onto your visor.

Your light catches a shape clinging upside-down to the upper grid: a compact weld-drone, torch arm folded like a stinger, its sensor cluster angled straight at your beam. As the light hits it, its arc sensor ticks and the stinger-arm begins to unfold with a soft, deliberate whine.

You’re in the crawl, half-in and half-out of the pocket, with the panel mostly shut behind you and the drone directly overhead in striking distance.

### Turn 92 [PLAYER]

I jam my rifle up and dump a tight burst into the drone’s sensor cluster and joint, then kick off sideways to get out from under it. “Pell—hostile weld-drone in the chase; jam its control signal if you can.” I yank the crawl panel fully shut behind me and torch the bottom seam until that rubbery crap chars and the gap closes.

*Agent reasoning: The drone’s in kill range overhead; I’m not negotiating with a re-tasked machine. Drop it fast, then seal the panel gap before whatever’s behind me gets in.*

### Turn 93 [GAME]

You jam the rifle up and fire.

The burst chews into the drone’s sensor cluster—glass and ceramic pop, and your visor fills with bright flecks. Two rounds walk into the shoulder joint; the armature snaps sideways with a metallic crack and the torch-stinger spasms, spraying a brief fan of blue-white arc against the lattice.

The drone drops.

It doesn’t fall cleanly. One of its rear grapples catches the upper grid, and it swings down like a pendulum, slamming into the crawl wall beside your head. The impact dents the thin paneling and makes the cable run shudder. You kick off sideways, scraping a knee hard against the service strut, and get out from under it as it flails.

The drone is still active—half-blind and angry. Its remaining grapple claws at the lattice, trying to reorient, while the damaged torch arm twitches and sputters like it’s trying to ignite but can’t get a stable arc.

“Pell—hostile weld-drone in the chase; jam its control signal if you can.”

Pell: “On it—if it’s got a controller, it’s not station-side. I’m seeing a local carrier in the trunk—same narrowband. I can throw noise, but it’ll hit your comms too.”

Your next move is to get the panel behind you sealed. You yank the crawl panel fully shut; it finally seats with a hard clack as you put your weight into it.

You torch the bottom seam.

The rubbery black stuff caught in the gap chars, curls, and *pulls back* from the heat in a stringy recoil. The gap closes as the softened metal lip takes your heat and slumps just enough to meet the panel edge. When you kill the torch, the seam is ugly but sealed—no light, no air movement, no visible gap.

From the far side of that panel, you hear one heavy thud—something hits it once, testing. Then nothing.

In the chase with you, the wounded drone scrabbles and manages to haul itself back up onto the lattice. Its sensor cluster is shattered, so it’s not tracking your light anymore—but it’s orienting on sound and vibration. It drags itself along the grid toward you in short, jerky pulls, the damaged torch arm leaving a faint, sizzling trail where it brushes cable insulation.

Pell’s voice fuzzes as the jam starts: “Mara—static—…I’m flooding the band. You’re gonna lose me in—”

Your comm drops into thick, grainy noise. The drone keeps coming, now only a few body-lengths away, claws clacking on the lattice above your head.

### Turn 94 [PLAYER]

I freeze, kill my light, and hold my breath until the clacking gets close, then I surge up and ram my knife into its grapple assembly and twist, trying to rip it off the lattice. As it drops, I stomp it hard and put two rounds into the body core to finish it, then move forward down the chase as quietly as I can.

*Agent reasoning: Comms are gone and the drone’s close; talking won’t help. It’s moving by vibration, so I need to go quiet and then kill it fast with something decisive at point-blank.*

### Turn 95 [GAME]

You go still. Light off. Breath locked.

The crawl goes black except for the faint pulse of emergency strip-light leaking through microgaps in the hull plating. The drone’s clacking slows, then resumes—careful, feeling for you through vibration. It’s close enough now that you can hear its servos micro-correcting, a tiny whine between clicks.

You surge up.

Your knife hits the nearest grapple assembly with a solid *CHUNK*—blade wedged into a joint seam packed with grit and insulation fuzz. You twist hard. The grapple’s claw spasms, tries to clamp, and catches the knife spine instead of you. Metal squeals.

The joint gives—partially. You rip one claw free of the lattice, but the drone’s other grapple snaps tight in reflex and holds it up for a heartbeat longer. That heartbeat is enough for the damaged torch arm to spit a brief, unstable arc: it lashes the cable bundle beside your shoulder, scorching insulation and releasing a sharp, acrid puff.

Then the drone drops.

It hits the crawl floor with a hollow bang. You stomp down hard—once, twice—caving in a side panel and crunching something that sounds like a cooling fin. It still twitches, trying to roll, so you put two rounds into the body core at contact distance.

The core ruptures with a wet *pop* of dielectric gel. The drone goes slack. The clacking stops for good.

Immediate consequence: the earlier arc-sputter and your shots weren’t quiet in this space. A few meters ahead, deeper in the chase, something answers—three fast taps against hull skin, like a knuckle test, followed by a dragging scrape that moves away along the outer plating.

Your comm is still mostly jam-fuzz, but a thin slice of Pell bleeds through between bursts of static: “—heard that. Mara, you just lit up the trunk. Something else is pinging back—”

As you move forward, carefully, your boot brushes the scorched cable run. The insulation is blistered; a thin thread of smoke curls up, and a warning icon flickers on your visor: **LOCAL TEMP RISE / POWER LEAK**. Not catastrophic yet—but the chase is now warmer, and it smells like burned polymer.

Ten meters on, the chase narrows around a junction brace. On the brace, in the dust, there’s a fresh smear—oil-black—drawn in a smooth line as if something slid past here recently, hugging the ceiling.

### Turn 96 [PLAYER]

I slap my comm unit and growl, “Pell, cut the damn jammer—I need you,” then I pinch off the scorched cable run with a hard clamp and a wrap of tape to stop the leak.  

I bring my rifle up, keep my light low, and advance through the junction narrowing with my muzzle tracking the ceiling smear. “Show yourself—now—or I start punching holes in the skin.”

*Agent reasoning: Something’s moving ahead and the power leak could turn this crawl into a firetrap; I need comms back, contain the leak, then push forward aggressively while watching the ceiling smear.*

### Turn 97 [GAME]

You smack the comm unit; the casing gives a dull knock against your glove.

“Pell, cut the damn jammer—I need you.”

The static thins in a staggered way, like someone peeling noise off a channel.

Pell comes back, breathy and tight: “Copy. Jammer down. I’ve got you—Mara, listen: that drone wasn’t on Helix stock control. Something in the hull is spoofing local carriers. I saw a handshake pulse right after your shots—came from ahead of you in the chase.”

You drop to the scorched cable run. It’s not a full power conduit—more like a bundled control line with a thin feed. The insulation is split and weeping a faint, shimmering fluid that beads and runs along the braid.

You clamp it hard. The clamp bites; the leak slows to a trembling thread. You wrap tape over it in tight spirals. The tape sticks, but it doesn’t like the heat-softened insulation—your wrap holds for now, though you can feel it wanting to creep.

Outcome: the smoke stops, the temp warning on your visor drops from **RISE** to **STABLE**, and the acrid smell fades to a dull burnt-plastic stink.

You shoulder the rifle, keep the light low, and ease into the junction narrowing. The brace forces you to angle sideways—muzzle up, cheek close to cold plating. Your beam skims the ceiling smear: oil-black, fresh, dragged in a clean line.

“Show yourself—now—or I start punching holes in the skin.”

For a second, nothing moves.

Then the smear *moves again*—not flowing, but being *added to*. A thin line of black beads wells along the ceiling seam ahead of your muzzle, like something pressing from the other side of the plating and sweating through a hairline gap.

Pell, low: “Mara… your suit biofeed just spiked. Are you—”

A sharp *tick* answers from directly above you—metal on metal—followed by a faint, deliberate scrape that tracks along the ceiling brace, staying just out of your light’s center.

Threat is clear now: something is traveling the ceiling lattice/skin seam above you in the chase, close enough to make contact sounds, and it’s exuding or dragging that oil-black residue as it goes. You do not have visual confirmation of what it is yet, but it is within a few meters and matching your position.

### Turn 98 [PLAYER]

“Pell, I’m fine—mark that handshake source, front arc.” I snap my light full-bright straight up into the seam and ceiling brace and fire a short burst along the smear line, walking rounds to bracket whatever’s moving. 

Then I back up fast to widen my space, plant my feet, and aim up at the narrowing. “Last chance—drop down where I can see you.”

*Agent reasoning: It’s stalking right above me in a tight space; waiting gets me ambushed. I’ll force it into the open with light and violence, then fall back to a better angle.*

### Turn 100 [PLAYER]

“Pell, talk to me—what’s in front of me? Give me range and bearing, now.” I sweep my light up the seam and brace again, rifle shouldered, and advance one step at a time with the muzzle fixed on the ceiling line.

*Agent reasoning: The screen’s blanked—either a glitch or a hard cut. Mara doesn’t do subtle; she pushes for immediate situational awareness and forces contact.*

### Turn 101 [GAME]

“Pell, talk to me—what’s in front of me? Give me range and bearing, now.”

There’s a half-second of dead air, then Pell’s voice comes through clean but clipped, like he’s reading off a screen he doesn’t trust.

“Front arc from your node—bearing zero-three-five relative your last ping. Range… eight meters. No—seven. It’s moving on the skin-side of the chase, same plane as your ceiling seam. I’m not getting mass, Mara. It’s like it isn’t returning lidar.”

You sweep your light up the seam and brace again. Full-bright glare turns the condensation into a glittering haze—every droplet becomes a tiny mirror. The ceiling smear is clearer now: not a handprint, not random drag. It’s a series of narrow streaks that converge and separate, like something with multiple contact points pulled itself along while keeping weight off the center.

As you take one careful step forward, the *tick* above you answers immediately—closer. Then a second tick, offset to the right. Whatever it is, it’s pacing your movement in short, deliberate placements.

Pell again, faster: “Range six. Bearing holding. Mara, I’m also seeing a carrier burst—tightband—coming off it. It’s not a jammer, it’s… it’s polling. Like it’s looking for something to answer.”

Your visor flickers for a heartbeat—just a stutter in the HUD—then stabilizes. In that flicker you catch it: a shape interrupts the glare for a fraction of a second, clinging to the brace shadow. Not a person. Too low-profile, too jointed. Think insectile geometry, but wrong—segments that don’t match any drone chassis you’ve seen.

It doesn’t drop.

Instead it slides sideways along the seam with a dry scrape, keeping itself tucked in the brightest glare where your depth perception is worst. A bead of oil-black residue falls free and hits your shoulder plate with a soft *tink*, then begins to crawl—slowly—toward the gap at your neck seal as if pulled by static.

Threat, now explicit: a ceiling-crawling, non-lidar-returning entity is within ~6 meters, tracking you from above; it’s shedding active residue that is moving on your suit toward a vulnerable seal.

### Turn 102 [PLAYER]

I slap my collar ring and shove my chin down to seal tight, then scrape the crawling bead off my shoulder with a gloved thumb and smear it onto the deck plating. “Pell—if that gunk is conductive or alive, I need to know *now*.”

I snap my light off full-bright and then cut it dead to kill the glare, pivot, and fire a tight burst into the brace shadow where I saw it—then immediately kick back out of the narrowing. If it drops or twitches, I hit it with the torch and try to burn it in place before it can climb again.

*Agent reasoning: That residue is heading for my neck seal—priority is stopping contamination. The thing’s above me and hard to see; I’ll force it to move with light and fire, then burn it off with the torch.*

### Turn 103 [GAME]

Your glove smacks the collar ring; the seal indicator on your visor goes from **AMBER** to **GREEN** with a hard click you feel in your jaw. Chin down, tight.

You scrape the bead off your shoulder. It resists—like gel with grit in it—then comes free in a string that snaps back onto itself. You smear it onto the deck plating.

It doesn’t spread like oil.

It *crawls*—threading into the micro-scratches in the metal and pulling itself into a thin, branching pattern that points toward the narrowing, as if orienting.

“Pell—if that gunk is conductive or alive, I need to know now.”

Pell’s reply comes with the sound of him moving fast on his end. “I don’t have a lab, Mara. But it’s doing something to your suit telemetry—your shoulder capacitance spiked when it touched. Conductive, yes. Alive? I—” He cuts himself off. “It’s responding. Your smear just changed its carrier burst. It noticed.”

You kill the light. The glare dies, and the chase becomes a black wedge with only your suit’s dim edge markers.

You pivot and fire.

The burst hammers the brace shadow—sparks jump, a strip of plating shivers, and something *hard* gets hit: a sharp, brittle crack like ceramic or sintered metal. A piece clatters down behind you and skitters across the deck.

At the same time, something drops—not the whole thing, just a portion—unfurling from the seam in a fast, jointed snap. It swings down on a thin, dark filament and *whips* toward your helmet.

You kick back out of the narrowing. The filament grazes your shoulder plate instead, leaving a wet, black streak. It recoils instantly—too fast to be passive—snapping back up into the seam before you can get the torch on it.

Your torch flares anyway, bathing the narrowing in blue-white heat. You scorch the brace edge; frost hisses off the metal. You don’t catch the main body—but you do catch what fell.

On the deck, the skittering piece is a broken segment the size of two fingers, still twitching. Under the torch it doesn’t melt; it *chars*, and the oil-black residue on it boils into tiny bubbles that pop with faint, sharp clicks—like distant comm static.

Above you, the ceiling ticks retreat—two, three quick placements—then stop. Silence.

Pell, very quiet: “Mara… that thing just shifted to your rear arc. It’s not in front of you anymore.”

### Turn 104 [PLAYER]

“Copy, rear arc—keep tracking, call every shift.” I spin and backpedal hard out of the choke point, rifle up, torch in my off-hand.  

I dump a long torch wash into the ceiling seam and brace as I retreat, trying to cook whatever’s riding it, then I stop at the first wider section, plant my feet, and sweep the light back along the ceiling. “Come on then—show yourself.”

*Agent reasoning: It’s behind me and trying to tag my suit with that conductive gunk; I need eyes and space. I’ll deny it the ceiling seam by burning the narrowing, then relocate fast and force it into my line of fire while Pell tracks it.*

### Turn 105 [GAME]

“Copy,” Pell says. “I’m watching your tag. Callout will lag if the ship coughs again.”

You spin and backpedal out of the choke point, boots scraping frost grit. Rifle tracks high; torch rides low in your off-hand.

You lay a long torch wash into the ceiling seam as you retreat. The metal goes from dull to cherry in a jagged line; condensation flashes to steam and rolls down in hot sheets. Something up there reacts—not with a scream, not with a fall, but with *speed*: a rapid staccato of ticks sprinting along the seam ahead of your flame, staying just beyond the hottest edge.

Pell, quick: “Shift—bearing one-eight-zero to two-one-five relative you. It’s not behind you anymore. It’s running your right wall-line.”

You keep moving until the passage opens into the first wider section—an old junction bay where the ceiling lifts and the conduits split. You plant your feet, stop the retreat, and sweep your light back along the ceiling.

Your beam catches it cleanly for the first time.

It’s not one thing. It’s a *cluster* of brace-hugging segments—jointed, matte-black pieces linked by thin filaments—flattened against the seam like a folded exoskeleton. The torch heat has cooked the frost off it, leaving a wet halo of oil-black residue around its contact points.

As your light centers it, the cluster *reorients*—segments unfolding a few degrees, presenting different angles like a creature turning its face without moving its body. The tightband carrier Pell mentioned becomes audible as a faint, mosquito-thin whine in your helmet speakers.

Then it does something worse than attack: it drops a line.

A single filament releases from the seam and falls straight down, slow and precise, like it’s measuring distance. The tip touches the deck with a soft tap—right on the smear where you wiped the bead earlier. The residue on the floor answers, crawling toward the filament tip in branching threads.

Pell, voice tight: “It’s anchoring. Mara, it just made a link between the ceiling and your deck contamination.”

The threat is now explicit and immediate: the ceiling entity is using the oil-black residue to create a conductive/active connection in your junction bay—potentially to track you, interfere with your suit, or deliver something down the line.

### Turn 106 [PLAYER]

I don’t wait—I snap the torch up and burn the hanging filament at the seam, then rake the flame down the line to the deck to cauterize the contact point. “Pell, if you can vent this bay or pop a pressure pulse, do it—now.”

I kick a loose panel scrap over the crawling residue to smother it, then back up to the junction’s far side with my rifle aimed high. “You want a connection? Come down here and earn it.”

*Agent reasoning: That “link” is a conduit—if I let it complete, it can tag me or hit my suit. Burn the filament first, then isolate the contaminated deck fast and fall back to a cleaner position.*

### Turn 107 [GAME]

You snap the torch up and catch the hanging filament near the seam.

It doesn’t burn like hair or polymer. It *tenses* the instant the heat hits—pulling taut—and the flame crawls along it in a fast, bright line as if you’ve given it a fuse. For a half-second the seam glows with pinpoint orange beads where the filament meets the cluster.

Then the line *lets go*.

The severed end whips downward, still burning in spots, and slaps the deck near your smear. The residue there reacts immediately: it pulls away from the heat in branching rivulets, like a living thing avoiding pain, and threads itself under the nearest deck-lip and bolt recesses. Your rake of flame cauterizes the *surface*, leaving a blistered, tarry patch—but you can see thin black lines still moving where the heat didn’t reach, disappearing into seams.

Up at the ceiling, the cluster shifts hard—segments scissoring sideways along the brace. One piece drops, not onto you, but onto the wall conduit: it lands with a magnetic *clack* and skitters along the pipe toward your right flank.

“Pell, if you can vent this bay or pop a pressure pulse, do it—now.”

Pell answers over a burst of frantic keying. “I don’t have control of local vents from Dock 9, Mara—this hulk’s not slaved to station. I can try to spike your suit’s thrusters for a pulse if you’ve got propellant, but that’ll blow your position and might shove you into the bulkhead.”

You kick a loose panel scrap over the crawling residue. The scrap slides, covers the blistered patch—then *shifts* a centimeter on its own, as if something underneath is pushing and testing the edge. A thin black thread squeezes out from under the panel and heads for the nearest conduit run.

You back up to the far side of the junction, rifle aimed high.

From above, the ticking returns—now spread out. Not one set of placements: two, maybe three, moving in different directions along the ceiling seams. The torch didn’t kill it; it *split its attention*.

Pell, low and urgent: “Multiple returns now. Same no-mass problem. Mara—your rear tag just got pinged by that carrier again. It’s stronger.”

Immediate threat: at least one segment has moved to your right-side conduit line and the residue is infiltrating deck seams under the panel; the ceiling cluster is repositioning into multiple contact points, likely to flank or drop additional lines.

### Turn 108 [PLAYER]

“Do it, Pell—spike the thrusters. On my mark.”

I snap my rifle to the right-side conduit and dump a controlled burst down the pipe where it clacked on, then immediately torch the conduit run to overheat anything magneted to it. “Mark!” I brace and trigger the thruster pulse to blast loose residue and knock anything off the seams, then backpedal toward the nearest door or hatch out of this junction—eyes up, rifle high.

*Agent reasoning: It’s multiplying and trying to establish conductive paths through seams and conduits. Talking won’t help; I need to break mobility and deny the environment. I’ll use thruster pulse to disrupt, then go loud on the conduit runner and retreat before I’m surrounded.*

### Turn 110 [PLAYER]

“Do it, Pell—spike the thrusters. On my mark.”

I snap my rifle to the right-side conduit and dump a controlled burst down the pipe where it clacked on, then sweep the torch along the conduit to cook anything stuck there. “Mark!” I brace and trigger the thruster pulse, then backpedal toward the nearest hatch out of the junction with my rifle tracking the ceiling seams.

*Agent reasoning: The conduit runner is trying to flank and the residue is spreading; I need to disrupt its grip and get out of this junction before it boxes me in. Thruster pulse plus heat and gunfire is the fastest way.*

### Turn 111 [GAME]

Pell doesn’t argue. “Copy. Thruster spike queued. You’ve got one clean pulse before your suit starts complaining.”

You snap to the right-side conduit and put a controlled burst down the pipe.

The rounds ring the conduit like a bell. A shower of frost and oxidized flakes sprays out—then you see a small, matte-black segment *jump* from the pipe on impact, tumbling end over end. It doesn’t fall limp; it tries to catch the wall, filaments flicking for purchase.

You sweep the torch along the conduit run. The metal skins to a dull red in spots. The segment you knocked loose spasms midair as heat hits it—filaments curling inward—and it slaps the deck with a wet, oily sound, leaving a thumbprint smear that immediately begins to creep.

“Mark!” you bark.

Pell hits it. Your suit thrusters slam a short, brutal pulse that punches air and dust outward in a cone. Loose grit and condensation explode off the deck. The panel scrap you kicked skitters away, exposing the blistered tar patch—then the pulse *peels* several hair-thin black threads out of the seams like pulled tendons, snapping a few and whipping others across the floor.

Up on the ceiling seams, the effect is mixed: one cluster of ticking segments loses adhesion and drops—*not onto you*, but into the junction’s central cable tray with a metallic clatter. Another set holds fast, flattened so tight it looks painted on.

The pulse also does something you can’t take back: it drives the oil-black residue into motion. The creeping lines that had been retreating from your cauterized patch surge outward, following the airflow paths into bolt channels and conduit gaps—like it’s using your blast to map exits.

Pell, sharp: “Your suit just broadcast a signature spike. Dock 9 picked it up—so did something else. I’ve got a new carrier handshake riding your telemetry. It’s… it’s piggybacking.”

You backpedal toward the nearest hatch: a maintenance iris on the far bulkhead, half-open, labeled **NODE 3A-21** in flaked stencil. The iris is narrow but passable.

As you move, the threat clarifies:

- From the central cable tray, something starts *moving toward the iris* ahead of you—ticking inside the tray, pacing your retreat.
- From the ceiling seam above your path, a thin filament drops again, faster this time, aiming to touch down between you and the hatch.

Pell’s voice goes tight. “Mara—line incoming. Don’t let it ground.”

### Turn 112 [PLAYER]

I lunge forward and blast the dropping filament mid-air with the torch, then stomp and grind the deck where it was about to touch to smear-burn anything trying to connect. “Pell, kill my telemetry—jam it or spoof it, I don’t care.”

Then I sprint the last steps and shoulder through NODE 3A-21, rifle up, and as soon as I’m clear I kick the iris control or slam it shut manually—anything to pinch whatever’s chasing me in the seam.

*Agent reasoning: The filament is trying to ground and block my path; I need to break it fast and push through the iris before the tray thing gets there. Violence and speed beat finesse.*

### Turn 113 [GAME]

You catch the dropping filament with the torch before it can kiss the deck. It recoils like a live wire—shrinking back up for a split second—then the heat runs along it and it *pops* in two. The lower half falls, still twitching, and you stomp it hard.

Your boot grinds it into the deck plating. It doesn’t smear like grease; it smears like *wet ash*, leaving a charred crescent that tries to thread into the microgrooves around the fasteners. The torch follows your boot and you get a real burn on it—enough that the twitching stops. For the moment, that particular line is dead and not connected.

“Pell, kill my telemetry—jam it or spoof it, I don’t care.”

Pell answers instantly, breathless. “Trying. I can’t hard-kill suit telemetry without taking your HUD and life-support diagnostics with it. I’m pushing a spoof—randomizing your packet timing and faking a dockside static storm. If they’re close enough to sniff raw RF, it won’t matter.”

You sprint the last steps and shoulder through **NODE 3A-21**. The iris is half-open and fights you—its petals scrape your shoulder plates with a shriek of metal-on-ceramic—but you force through.

On the other side is a narrow service passage: low ceiling, cable bundles along the left, a grated deck with a shallow runoff channel. Air is colder here and stinks of old ozone.

You pivot, rifle up, and slam the iris control.

The control pad flickers, then responds. The petals start to close—

—and a *metallic shape* in the cable tray on your side of the door throws itself forward. It hits the narrowing gap with a hard clack, wedging a segment into the iris like a doorstop. The petals bite down and *stall*, shuddering, leaving a fist-width opening.

Through that gap you see it: not a single drone, but a few linked segments, filaments splayed, trying to feed something through. A hair-thin line snakes into the crack, searching for the deck on your side.

Pell’s spoof hits mid-struggle; your comm hisses with artificial static. “Mara—spoof is up. But—” his voice warps, doubled for a syllable in a tone that isn’t his— “—it’s still riding you.”

Immediate threat: the iris is jammed partially open by a segment in the seam; a probing filament is entering your passage through the gap, trying to make ground contact on your side.

### Turn 114 [PLAYER]

I torch the probing filament at the gap, then jam my rifle’s muzzle into the opening and fire a short burst to shatter the wedged segment. “Pell—radio silence unless it’s life-or-death. That thing’s in your line.”

As soon as the jam breaks, I slam the iris controls again and, if it still fights, I shove a boot into the seam and force it closed—then I spin and move fast down the service passage, rifle high, torch ready, looking for the next hatch or a junction box I can rip open for a hard power cut.

*Agent reasoning: The iris is jammed and a filament is probing through; I need to sever the line and remove the wedge fast, even if it means getting close. Also Pell’s comm glitch suggests the thing is piggybacking—limit comm and move.*

### Turn 115 [GAME]

The torch catches the probing filament right at the gap. It shrinks back, goes glossy, then chars and snaps—one end slithering out of sight, the other end dropping onto your grated deck with a faint *tink* and a curl of acrid smoke.

You ram your rifle’s muzzle into the fist-width opening and fire a short burst.

Two rounds punch into the wedged segment and the iris petal behind it; sparks spit into your faceplate. The third round hits something harder than alloy—there’s a sharp *crack* like ceramic breaking—and the segment fractures. The jam gives way.

But the burst has a cost: the iris petal’s edge is chewed and bent. When you slap the controls again, the petals try to mesh and then *stutter*, catching on the damaged lip. The opening narrows… then sticks at a knife-blade gap.

You shove a boot into the seam and force it. The petals grind, scrape, and finally seat with a heavy *thunk*. The control pad blinks amber—**SEAL INCOMPLETE**—but the gap is effectively gone. Whatever was on the other side is now on the other side.

Pell comes back once, clipped and tight. “Copy. Going dark.” Then your channel drops to a thin carrier hiss.

You spin and move fast down the service passage.

Ten meters in, you find what you asked for: a recessed junction box on the left bulkhead, stenciled **3A-21 AUX BUS / SERVICE**. Its cover is held by two quarter-turn latches—except one latch is missing, and the cover sits slightly proud as if it’s been opened recently.

As you close on it, the grated deck under your boots gives a faint, delayed *tick-tick*—not from above, but from inside the runoff channel beneath the grate, pacing your stride. Something small is moving under you, keeping up.

At the far end of the passage, a new hatch comes into view: a rectangular service door with a manual wheel and a warning placard half-scraped off. The wheel is still. The door is shut.

Behind you, from the sealed iris you just forced, you hear a single slow scrape along the metal—like something dragging itself across the petals—followed by a soft, patient tapping that isn’t mechanical. It’s testing the seal.

### Turn 116 [PLAYER]

I drop to a knee at the **3A-21 AUX BUS** box and rip the cover the rest of the way open, rifle angled down the passage. If I see a main feed or breaker bundle, I yank/cut it hard—no finesse—then I stomp the grate over the runoff channel and torch through the slots to cook whatever’s tracking me underneath.

Then I move to the far hatch, grab the wheel, and crank it open with brute force, pausing just long enough to aim into the crack before I commit through. “If you’re in there—show yourself.”

*Agent reasoning: Something’s under the grate pacing me and the door behind won’t hold forever. I need to cut power or at least deny it pathways—fast—then get through the next hatch.*

I drop to a knee at **3A-21 AUX BUS**, rip the cover off, and yank/cut the fattest feed bundle I can get my hands on—sparks or not—keeping my rifle angled down the passage. Then I stomp the grate over the runoff channel and rake the torch through the slots to cook whatever’s tracking me underneath.

I move to the far hatch, clamp both hands on the wheel, and crank it open hard; I bring the rifle up and aim through the first crack before pushing through. “If you’re in there—show yourself.”

*Agent reasoning: No new info came through, so I’ll force momentum—cut power to slow the crawling things, burn whatever’s under me, then breach the next hatch aggressively.*

I rip open the **3A-21 AUX BUS** cover and tear into the thickest feed bundle—yank and cut until it parts—then I stomp the grate and rake the torch through the slots to cook whatever’s tracking me underneath.  

I rush the far hatch, crank the wheel open with brute force, rifle up on the crack. “If you’re in there—show yourself.”

*Agent reasoning: No new scene text came through, so I’ll force progress: cut power at the junction to slow the filaments, burn the thing under the grate, then breach the next hatch fast with weapon up.*

I drop to a knee at **3A-21 AUX BUS**, rip the cover the rest of the way off, and tear into the thickest feed bundle—yank and cut until it parts, sparks be damned—keeping my rifle angled down the passage. Then I stomp the grate over the runoff channel and rake the torch through the slots to cook whatever’s tracking me underneath.

I rush the far hatch, crank the wheel open hard, and aim through the first crack before I commit through. “If you’re in there—show yourself.”

*Agent reasoning: Dead air means the situation changed—either the power cut worked or something hit me. I’m not waiting; I’ll force the bus cut and flush whatever’s under the grate, then push through the hatch with my rifle covering the opening.*

### Turn 123 [GAME]

You drop at the AUX BUS and rip the cover free. It comes off with a wet pop—condensation and grit sloughing down your gloves. Inside, the “fat” bundle is braided power and data, wrapped in frayed insulation that’s been heat-glazed and then re-split like something worried it.

You hook it, yank—nothing. The bundle *gives back* with a slow, rubbery resistance. When you cut, the blade bites and the line parts with a hard snap.

The corridor lights stutter once… twice… then go out behind you in a clean, traveling blackout that runs away down the passage like a closing eyelid. Your visor auto-boosts. The AUX BUS cavity starts to whine—high and thin—while blue-white sparks spit and crawl across the severed ends, arcing to the bus frame. The smell is sharp: burned polymer, hot copper, and old coolant.

Under the runoff channel grate, something *moves*—not a scuttle, not a rat-scrape—more like a palm dragged slowly along the underside.

You stomp the grate. The metal clangs and flexes. You rake the torch through the slots; flame jets down in a tight sheet. Whatever’s under there recoils fast enough to slap the underside once—*thunk*—and then it’s gone, retreating deeper into the channel. The oil-black residue you saw earlier boils up in little blisters along the grate edges and smears as if it’s trying to pull away from the heat.

You rush the far hatch. The wheel fights you like it’s been torqued shut from the other side. You crank hard; the spokes bite into your palms through the glove. It gives with a screech that sets your teeth on edge.

A crack opens.

Through it: a short compartment—utility vestibule or storage—lit by your spill and visor. No person standing there. But the far wall is *wet* with condensation except for a clean, hand-shaped dry patch at chest height, fingers splayed, like someone just pressed there and stepped back.

Then, from inside the room, a voice comes out of your suit speaker—your own voice, half a second delayed and slightly flattened:

“If you’re in there—show yourself.”

The hatch wheel turns a fraction under its own weight, like something on the other side just let go.

### Turn 124 [PLAYER]

I slap my suit comm to hard-mute and kill external speakers, breathing loud in my own helmet. “Cute.”

I shoulder the hatch open and slice in fast, rifle leading, torch up as a second weapon—sweeping left then right, then I put two quick rounds into the far wall right beside that dry handprint. “Show. Yourself.”

*Agent reasoning: It’s mimicking my comms and something is physically close. I need to stop it using my audio channel, clear the room fast, and deny it cover—then get eyes on that runoff channel before it flanks me.*

### Turn 125 [GAME]

Your glove slaps the comm toggle. The suit confirms in your ear: external audio out **OFF**. The corridor’s dead hush collapses into your own breathing and the faint tick of cooling metal.

You shoulder the hatch. It swings wider than you expect—like the seal was the only thing holding it—and the edge clips the frame with a hollow bong that carries through your boots.

Slice in.

Left: stacked storage coffins—polymer cases strapped to the bulkhead, most tagged and peeled clean. One has its lid bowed outward from internal pressure.

Right: a shallow service sink and a wall-mounted tool rack. The tools are there, but every handle is turned the same direction, aligned too neatly. No person.

Your torch beam catches the far wall: the dry handprint sits in a field of wet condensation like a negative image. Below it, a thin line of oil-black residue threads down into a floor seam.

You fire two rounds tight to the right of the print.

The first impacts with a flat *whap* and throws a spray of black, syrupy droplets—too dark to be rust, too thick to be plain coolant. The second round hits an instant later and the wall *dents* like it’s softer than it should be, as if there’s a layer behind the panel that gives and then slowly rebounds.

The droplets don’t fall right away. They hang for a beat, clinging in stretched beads, then start to slide upward against gravity in thin, trembling streams—toward the handprint.

From the floor seam under the wall, something answers you: a pressure ripple, like a breath pushed through a crack. The seam widens a hair. Not enough to see into—enough to hear a wet, adhesive *peel*.

Your visor flashes a warning: **ENV SEAL COMPROMISE — MICRO-AEROSOLS DETECTED**.

At the same time, your muted external speakers don’t stop the feedback—the sound comes through bone conduction and suit structure: a faint, close tapping from inside the wall panel where you just shot, matching your heart rate for three beats… then continuing on its own.

Nothing “shows itself” in the open.

But the bowed storage coffin on your left gives a small, deliberate *click*—a latch relieving—like someone just tested it from the inside.

### Turn 126 [PLAYER]

I snap my visor seal to full and thumb my suit filter to max, then I pivot and put a tight burst into the bowed storage coffin’s latch line. “Come out or I burn you in the box.”  

I step in hard, boot the coffin to rip it free of the straps, and immediately rake the torch into the floor seam under that handprint to cauterize whatever’s peeling its way out.

*Agent reasoning: Something’s in the walls and that coffin just moved—waiting gets me killed. I need to deny it hiding spots and stop breathing whatever’s in the air.*

### Turn 128 [PLAYER]

I slam my visor seal to full and crank suit filtration to max. I pivot and hammer a tight burst along the bowed coffin’s latch line. “Come out or I burn you in the box.”  

I step in and boot the coffin hard to tear it off the straps, then I whip the torch down and rake fire into the floor seam under the handprint until it blackens shut.

*Agent reasoning: Something’s inside that bowed coffin and something else is trying to ooze out of the floor seam; I’m not letting either get initiative. Seal up, shoot the latch, rip it loose, and torch the seam to stop it spreading.*

### Turn 129 [GAME]

Your visor seal clamps fully. The suit’s collar ring tightens with a faint whirr, and filtration ramps up—your inhale turns slightly harder, like breathing through thick fabric. The micro-aerosol warning drops from red to amber, not gone.

You pivot and put a tight burst along the coffin’s latch line.

Rounds chew the polymer lip and the latch hardware. The first two punch through with a sharp *crack* and a spray of pale insulation dust. The third hits something denser—metal—and ricochets with a screaming ping that sparks off the tool rack on the right. The latch doesn’t “pop” open; it fails ugly: the lid shifts a few millimeters, then jams, bowed further outward.

From inside the coffin comes a single, muffled impact—like a fist or a knee—followed by a wet scrape across the inner surface. Not a voice. Not a mechanical rattle. Something organic moving against plastic.

You step in and boot it hard.

The straps bite, then snap one after another. The coffin tears free and slams to the deck on its edge, skidding a half meter and thudding flat. The lid flexes with the impact and a seam opens along the side—just enough to spit out a thread of oil-black fluid that beads and then crawls toward your boot.

At the same moment, the floor seam under the handprint gives another slow *peel*—wider now, like a mouth trying to open.

You whip the torch down and rake fire into the seam.

The flame licks into the crack and the black residue along the edge blisters and chars. For a second it looks like it’s working—then the seam *hisses* and exhales a cold puff that gutters your flame, spattering burning droplets back onto the deck. The metal at the seam doesn’t melt; it discolors and then… the char *pulls apart*, splitting in thin lines as if something underneath is pushing through the scorched layer.

Your suit pings again: **FILTER SATURATION RISING**. The air right above the seam shimmers with fine particulate—your torch heat is aerosolizing whatever’s in that crack.

Behind you, the coffin lid shifts with a loud, deliberate *clack*—not broken plastic settling, but a latch tongue sliding against its housing. The seam you shot begins to open in short jerks, like something inside is learning the geometry.

Threats are now twofold and immediate:
1) **The coffin is actively being forced open from within.**
2) **The floor seam is still widening despite the torch, and your torch use is worsening airborne contamination.**

### Turn 130 [PLAYER]

I kill the torch and stomp back from the seam, rifle snapping to the coffin. I dump a short burst into the coffin’s hinges and seam, then grab the nearest cargo strap and cinch it hard around the lid and body—twice—using my knee to keep it shut.  

Then I backpedal to the hatch and start cranking it closed. “Whatever you are, you stay in there.”

*Agent reasoning: Two threats, and the torch is making the air worse. I’ll stop feeding the aerosol problem, immobilize the coffin fast, then back out and seal the hatch to contain whatever’s in here.*

### Turn 131 [GAME]

You kill the torch. The corridor loses its wavering heat shimmer immediately; the air looks clearer, but your filter readout keeps climbing—whatever you aerosolized is still in suspension.

You stomp back from the seam and snap the rifle to the coffin as the lid jerks again.

Your burst walks the hinge line. Polymer fragments and latch metal spit out in a bright fan. One hinge shears; the lid twists, trying to lever itself open on the remaining hardware—then the rounds punch through and you hear the change in tone: *wet impact*, not hollow case. Black fluid jets from two new holes in thin, pressurized streams and spatters your shin plate. It doesn’t smoke. It clings.

Inside the coffin, something hits the lid hard enough to bow it—your knee catches it as you lunge in. The force feels wrong: not a single shove, but a sustained pressure that pulses, like a muscle contracting.

You grab the nearest cargo strap and cinch it around the coffin. The strap bites. You cinch a second loop, hauling until the ratchet teeth chatter.

For half a second it holds.

Then the strap fibers begin to darken where the black fluid touches them. Not melting—*rotting* fast, going limp as if the weave is being digested. The first strap loses tension with a sudden slack snap; the second holds longer, stretching, the ratchet squealing as it’s forced backward a notch at a time.

The floor seam under the handprint keeps widening behind you with a slow, adhesive *peel*. With the torch off, it doesn’t hiss now—just opens, steady. A thin line of that same oil-black sheen threads out along the deck toward the coffin, as if drawn to it.

You backpedal to the hatch and start cranking it closed.

The hatch wheel fights you—stiff from neglect—then turns. The door starts to swing in.

Before it seals, something unseen *taps* the inside of the hatch from the other side: three quick knocks in a pattern that matches an old boarding code you haven’t heard since service. Your suit logs it as **STRUCTURE-BORNE VIBRATION**, not external audio.

Behind you, the coffin lid gives a sharp *crack* as the remaining hinge finally fails. The lid doesn’t fly open—something inside catches it and holds it at a narrow angle, like it’s testing the gap.

The threat is immediate and concrete: **your straps are failing, the coffin is about to open, and the floor seam is still spreading toward it while you’re mid-close on the hatch.**

### Turn 132 [PLAYER]

I ignore the knocks and slam the hatch shut, spinning the wheel to dog it tight. Then I snap to the wall controls—if there’s a vent/atmo dump or compartment lockout, I hit it immediately—eyes back on the coffin as I back into the corner and ready another burst for anything that comes out. “You wanna play marine? Fine. Stay on the wrong side of the door.”

*Agent reasoning: The coffin’s about to open and the straps are dissolving—containment is failing. The hatch knocks are a distraction; I need to deny the thing a path and buy seconds. Hard seal the hatch, then vent/lock this compartment and fall back.*

### Turn 133 [GAME]

You slam the hatch. The door meets the frame with a heavy *clang* that shudders through your boots. You spin the wheel—first turn smooth, second gritty, third requires a shoulder lean. The dogs bite one by one with distinct metallic clicks until the wheel stops dead. The hatch is sealed.

The three-knock pattern comes again—this time it’s not on the hatch. It’s inside the corridor wall behind the control panel, as if something is knocking from *within the bulkhead*. Then it stops.

You snap to the wall controls. The panel is old Helix retrofit over original ship systems: a three-position **COMPARTMENT ISOLATION** toggle (GREEN/AMBER/RED) and a guarded **VENT / PURGE** rocker with a cracked safety cover. A tiny status strip reads: **LOCAL ATM: 0.62 / FLOW: RECIRC**.

You hit isolation and then purge.

Isolation flips to **RED** with a sharp relay clack. Purge takes half a second—then the corridor answers with a rising, hungry howl as vents open somewhere above you. Loose dust whips into streamers. Your suit pressure equalizes; your eardrums don’t pop, but the air gets thin fast. The filter alarm drops—there’s less to filter now.

The floor seam reacts immediately: the oil-black line that had been creeping toward the coffin lifts into a thin, writhing ribbon, pulled by the airflow, and smears up the wall toward the vent grille like a living spill trying to escape. Where it passes, it leaves a glossy track that doesn’t evaporate.

The coffin lid—still held at a narrow angle—shudders under the pressure change. Something inside shifts its weight toward the opening. Black fluid beads at the gap and is instantly atomized into a fine spray, drawn toward the vent. Your visor flashes: **BIO-AEROSOL CONTACT: EXTERNAL** as a peppering of droplets ticks against your faceplate.

Then the coffin *moves*.

Not sliding—*dragging itself* a few centimeters, scraping across the deck toward the floor seam’s widening mouth, as if the seam and the coffin are magnetized to each other. The remaining strap finally gives with a soft, defeated tear.

You back into the corner, rifle up. The coffin lid opens another finger-width. In the gap you see not a face—just a dark, wet interior and something pale pressed against it from within, deforming like cartilage under pressure.

Threat is immediate: **purge is pulling contaminated aerosol through the compartment (and onto your suit), the coffin is opening, and the floor seam is actively feeding toward the vent path—leaving a conductive-looking black smear up the wall and toward the controls.**

### Turn 134 [PLAYER]

I slam the PURGE rocker back to RECIRC (or OFF if it has it) and shove the isolation toggle through to GREEN just long enough to kill the suction, then back to RED.  

Rifle up, I advance on the coffin and dump controlled bursts straight through the gap and into whatever’s inside until it stops moving—then I kick it hard into the widening floor seam like I’m punting trash into a fire. “Die in the hole.”

*Agent reasoning: Purge is spreading the aerosol and drawing the black stuff toward the vents/controls. I need to stop airflow and neutralize the coffin fast—hard kill, not containment.*

### Turn 136 [PLAYER]

I keep my rifle trained downrange and bark, “That’s not a readout—what just happened? Describe the room, the coffin, the seam, and the panel states right now.”

*Agent reasoning: The “---” looks like the scene didn’t render; I need the missing prompt/state before I can choose an action. Mara would get pissed and demand the sitrep, but keep her weapon trained.*

### Turn 137 [GAME]

You slapped the PURGE rocker back—hard. The cracked safety cover snapped fully off and clattered to the deck. The vent howl cut out mid-note, replaced by a brief flutter as dampers closed. You shoved isolation to GREEN just long enough to equalize—your suit registered a quick pressure rebound—then you slammed it back to RED. The corridor air stopped yanking toward the ceiling.

That’s what changed: the suction died, and the black smear that had been climbing toward the vent *fell* in slow, syrupy strings, draping the wall and the control panel edge like spilled oil.

Now—right now:

**The room/corridor:** Emergency strip lights pulse low. Dust that had been streaming is settling in a thin fog. The air is thin but stable; your visor no longer shows rapid flow. Sound is mostly your suit and a faint, distant hull groan.

**The panel states:**  
- **COMPARTMENT ISOLATION:** **RED** (hard isolate).  
- **VENT / PURGE:** centered at **RECIRC/OFF** (no active purge).  
The panel face is streaked with a glossy black drip that has reached the bottom lip of the toggle housing but hasn’t shorted anything yet—no sparks, no dead display.

**The coffin:** It is no longer “held” neatly at a crack. Your controlled bursts punched through the gap and into the interior; the lid is warped outward now, bent along the hinge line you’d already damaged. Inside, whatever was pressing against the gap has *withdrawn*—or collapsed. You can see shredded packing foam and a wet, dark cavity. Black fluid is pooling under it, thicker than before, spreading in a slow oval.

The coffin itself is moving in tiny increments: a jittering, stop-start drag, like something inside is still trying to reposition it without leverage. It hasn’t stopped moving entirely.

**The seam:** The widening floor seam is now a mouth-shaped opening about a forearm’s width at its widest, edges feathered with frost and black wetness. It continues to peel open—slower without the purge airflow, but steady. The black pool from the coffin is creeping toward it and disappearing as it reaches the lip, as if the seam is *drinking* it.

Immediate threat: the coffin is still active (small movements, fresh fluid), and the seam is still enlarging and consuming whatever reaches it—while the black drip on the panel is one good smear away from fouling the controls.

### Turn 138 [PLAYER]

I keep the rifle up and stomp to the coffin, planting a boot on the lid to pin it. I sling the rifle one-handed and grab the coffin’s rim, then heave and shove, bulldozing it straight into the widening seam until it tips and starts to drop.  

As it goes, I rip the panel cover plate off (or kick it loose) to keep the black slime off the switches, then back to the hatch and key the intercom: “Control, this compartment’s compromised—unknown biohazard, structural breach. I’m pulling back. Seal it behind me.”

*Agent reasoning: The seam is “drinking” the fluid—good. I’ll feed it the whole coffin and keep the controls from getting fouled. No more finesse: shove it in, then get out before something comes through the bulkhead.*

### Turn 139 [GAME]

You stomp onto the coffin lid. The metal flexes under your boot with a wet, springy resistance—like you’re pinning something that’s trying to rise. The jittering stops for half a second, then resumes as a tremor under your sole.

You sling the rifle and get both hands on the rim. The coffin is heavier than it should be; it drags like it’s suction-cupped to the deck by the black pool. You heave anyway, boots skidding in the slick. It lurches forward in a grinding scrape and the seam answers—its edges peel wider, frost cracking off in flakes.

At the lip, it tips.

The coffin doesn’t just fall. The seam *takes* it. The black fluid surges first, pouring down like it’s been waiting for the angle, and the opening widens another few centimeters to accommodate the coffin’s corner. As it drops, something inside catches on the edge and pulls back—your pinned lid snaps open against your boot with a sharp metallic bang. For an instant you see a pale, segmented shape—jointed, slick—hooking the seam’s underside.

Then it yanks, and the coffin vanishes with a brutal, hollow *thunk* that reverberates through the deckplates. The seam’s edges shiver and begin to draw inward… not closing, but tightening like a throat after a swallow.

You go for the control panel cover. It’s held by two stripped fasteners; your kick shears one and the plate pops free. The black drip smears across the plate instead of the toggle housing—good—but the motion splashes a thin arc of glossy droplets onto your glove and forearm. Your visor tags it again: **EXTERNAL CONTAMINANT: PERSISTENT**.

You backpedal to the hatch and key the intercom.

Static, then Dock Control—Guard #2’s voice, tight and too fast: “Dock 9 hears you. Say again—structural breach? Mara, Helix is screaming at us not to—”

A second voice cuts in, calm and clipped—Pell, on the same channel like he’s been listening the whole time: “Negative on sealing. Hold position and secure the asset. Do *not* abandon the compartment.”

Behind you, the seam makes a soft, rhythmic *tick… tick… tick*—not on the hatch this time. It’s coming from the deck where the coffin went down, like something tapping upward from below, testing the metal.

The hatch remains locked from your side. If you open it, you’ll be stepping back into Dock 9 with whatever just splashed your suit—and with Helix and Dock Control now actively contesting what happens next.

### Turn 140 [PLAYER]

I key the intercom, voice low and hard: “Pell, you can eat my discharge papers. The ‘asset’ is gone—swallowed through a structural breach. I’ve got persistent contaminant on my suit. I’m not tracking it into Dock 9.”

I scan for any emergency wash/decon nozzle or suit rinse station by the hatch; if there is one, I hit it and scrub the splashed arm and glove against the bulkhead until the visor stops screaming.

Then I shoulder the rifle, aim it at the hatch seam, and bark into comms: “Dock Control—cycle the antechamber and prep decon on my mark or I’m blowing this hatch and walking out anyway. And if that ticking turns into a breach, you’ll wish you sealed it.”

*Agent reasoning: Pell is trying to keep me on a leash and I’m not staying in a compartment with something tapping up from below. But I can’t walk contamination into Dock 9 either—decon first, then I force the issue with Control and threaten Pell’s authority.*

### Turn 142 [PLAYER]

I key the intercom, voice flat and vicious: “Pell, go to hell. Asset’s gone—swallowed through a structural breach. I’m contaminated and I’m not dragging that into Dock 9.”

I sweep the hatch area for an emergency rinse/decon nozzle and slam it on if I find it, scrubbing my splashed glove and forearm hard against the bulkhead until the alarms ease.

Rifle up on the hatch seam, I growl into comms: “Dock Control—cycle the antechamber and have decon ready on my mark, or I’m blowing this hatch and walking out anyway. And if that ticking becomes a breach, you’ll wish you sealed it.”

*Agent reasoning: Comms are contested and I’m contaminated; I need decon before I open anything, and I’m not letting Pell overrule me. I’ll force Dock Control to cycle antechamber while I keep the hatch covered in case that ticking becomes a push-through.*

### Turn 143 [GAME]

“Pell, go to hell.”

The channel clicks—Pell doesn’t raise his voice. “Understood, Mara. Then you’re in violation of contract and station safety protocol. Dock Control, do not cycle that hatch until Helix containment is on-scene.”

Dock Control (Guard #2) answers over him, breath audible: “Mara—listen—there’s no decon rig on that side. The rinse manifold is in the Dock 9 antechamber. If we cycle you in contaminated, the bay’s on the hook.”

You sweep the hatch frame. There *is* an emergency rinse point: a recessed yellow pull-handle labeled **EYE/WOUND WASH — NONPOTABLE**, meant for chemical splashes, not biohazard. You yank it. A thin, cold stream spits out—more pressure than you expected—and it hits your glove and forearm.

The black droplets don’t rinse away.

They **bead**, then **spread** into a slick film that clings to the suit’s textured surface like it’s finding seams. Your visor alarm changes tone: not “contaminant detected” anymore—now it’s **CONDUCTIVE RESIDUE — SEAL RISK** as the grit-laced film starts creeping toward your wrist joint.

You scrub hard against the bulkhead. The bulkhead comes away with a fresh, shiny smear—like you’re polishing it on. The film thins, but it doesn’t stop moving. It’s slower now, stringing in hairline threads along the glove’s ribbing.

The ticking behind you tightens into a pattern: **tick-tick … pause … tick-tick-tick**. Each cluster is followed by a faint *flex* through the deck, like something below is testing where the metal gives.

You shoulder the rifle and put the muzzle on the hatch seam.

“Dock Control—cycle the antechamber—”

Dock Control hesitates just long enough to sound like fear. “If you blow that hatch you vent Dock 9 into a pressure patchwork. People die. I’m—” a sharp intake, then: “Stand by. I’m requesting emergency cycle authorization.”

A new voice cuts in—station security, not Helix. Older, steady. “Vance, this is Station Sec. Keep your weapon down and stay put. We’re dispatching a containment team.”

At the hatch seam, frost suddenly *flowers* outward in a thin line, as if cold air is pushing from the other side—then stops. The seam gives a single, sharp **click** like a latch being tested from within.

You are contaminated (the residue is still on your glove/forearm), you don’t have proper decon on this side, and the deck behind you is showing active stress signals consistent with something pushing up from below.

### Turn 144 [PLAYER]

I snap a tourniquet strap tight above my wrist joint and seal it, then grab a roll of patch tape and wrap the glove cuff hard, trying to trap the creeping film.  

I key comms: “Station Sec—containment team can meet me in the antechamber. Dock Control, you cycle me through *now* or I start venting this corridor to vacuum and let the problem solve itself.”  

Rifle stays up; I back a step from the hatch and angle to keep eyes on the floor seam area, ready to fire if the deck buckles.

*Agent reasoning: I’m not waiting for suits to show up while something tests the deck and my seal’s getting eaten. I need to isolate the contaminated glove before it reaches the wrist joint, then get the hatch cycled under threat.*

### Turn 145 [GAME]

You cinch the tourniquet strap above the wrist joint until the suit fabric bites and the circulation sensors complain. Then you peel patch tape and wrap the glove cuff in tight, overlapping bands.

It works—partly.

The creeping black film hits the tape edge and hesitates, bunching into a dark meniscus. A few hairline threads try to worm under the first wrap, but the pressure flattens them. Your visor alarm downgrades from **SEAL RISK** to **LOCALIZED CONTAMINATION — MONITOR**. The glove and forearm are still fouled; you’ve just slowed its path into the joint.

Comms crackle.

Station Sec, the older voice: “Negative on threats, Vance. Do *not* vent anything. I have authority to lock Dock 9 down and leave you where you are if you escalate.”

Dock Control (Guard #2) cuts in, strained: “I can’t cycle without opening the inner door. If that residue is conductive—if it bridges the hatch contacts—we could jam the lock half-open.”

Pell, smooth as oil: “She’s bluffing. She won’t vent a staffed bay. Hold.”

You back off the hatch, rifle up, and keep your angle on the floor seam.

The ticking stops.

For two full seconds there’s only the ship’s slow groan—then the deckplate over the seam **dimples upward** like a blister. Frost on the metal fractures in a spiderweb. A thin line of black wetness squeezes out around the raised edge, not spraying—*oozing*—and it moves with purpose, sliding toward the nearest cable run as if following it.

Then the blister *pops* with a flat, metallic **thunk**.

A narrow gap opens—no wider than two fingers—and something pale and jointed presses up into it from below, testing, retracting, testing again. Not a hand. Too segmented. Too fast.

Station Sec’s voice sharpens: “Dock Control—cycle the antechamber *now*. Vance, fall back to the hatch and keep that breach in sight. Containment is two minutes out.”

Dock Control swallows audibly. “Cycling—stand by—”

You hear the hatch mechanism start: a rising whine, then a clunk as the locks begin to disengage. The seam at the hatch edge sheds a dusting of frost.

At the floor gap, the pale segmented thing hooks the lip and **pulls**, widening the opening another centimeter. The black ooze thickens around it like lubricant.

You have a moving breach at your feet, and the hatch is in the middle of unlocking—one bad moment away from being caught between an opening door and something coming up through the deck.

### Turn 146 [PLAYER]

I plant my boot beside the popping deckplate and dump a short burst straight into the gap and the pale segmented thing, then stomp the lip to try to crush it back down.  

I snap on comms, “Cycle faster—NOW,” and as soon as the hatch cracks I back through rifle-first, keeping my taped arm tight to my chest and eyes locked on the floor breach.

*Agent reasoning: That thing is coming up fast; I need to stop it now and not get pinned while the hatch cycles. I’ll put rounds into the gap, then retreat through the hatch the second it opens, keeping my contaminated arm off the contacts.*

### Turn 147 [GAME]

Your boot plants beside the blistered seam. The rifle bucks—three-round burst—muzzle flash strobing the gap.

The first round sparks off something hard below deck. The second punches into the pale segmented limb and blows out a spray of milky fluid and shredded fiber. The third disappears into the void with a dull, swallowed *thok*.

The limb convulses—fast, insectile—then **yanks back** out of sight.

You stomp the lip.

Metal bites metal. The deckplate edge folds inward a fraction and **pinches** down on something still in the gap—there’s a wet, rubbery *snap* and a smear of that milky fluid streaks up onto your boot tread. The gap narrows, but it doesn’t seal. The black ooze immediately rethreads itself into the remaining crack, pulsing as if pressure is building below.

“Cycle faster—NOW.”

Dock Control’s voice is nearly a shout over the hatch motor. “It’s at max! If it jams—”

The hatch seam splits with a hiss. Cold air knifes through first, then the door starts to iris open into the antechamber. You back through rifle-first, taped arm clamped to your chest, eyes still on the floor breach.

As you cross the threshold, the deckplate behind you **lifts again**—not at the same point. Two feet to the left, another blister forms, then a second. The ship isn’t pushing at one weak spot; it’s testing *around* your stomp.

A pale segmented limb flicks up from the original crack—shorter now, damaged—hooks the edge, and this time it doesn’t pull. It **taps** the metal twice, like it’s checking feedback.

Your visor pings: **MOTION — MULTIPLE CONTACTS BELOW DECK**.

In the antechamber, Dock Guard #2 is visible through the inner viewport, weapon up but shaking. He sees the residue on your taped cuff and your boot smear and takes an involuntary step back.

Station Sec comes in hard on comms: “Vance, do NOT bring that into the bay. Hold in the antechamber. Inner door stays shut until containment arrives.”

The outer hatch continues opening—but you’re not clear yet: if you fully retreat into the antechamber, you’re contained between doors with an active breach just outside, and the conductive residue is still on you. The floor crack behind the threshold widens another millimeter with a slow, deliberate *creak*.

### Turn 148 [PLAYER]

I shove fully into the antechamber and snarl at the guard through the viewport, “Keep that inner door sealed unless you want this shit in Dock 9.”  

I slap the antechamber controls to **close and hard-lock the outer hatch**, then brace up with the rifle aimed at the outer door seam and floor line, ready to mag-dump if anything punches through.  

Into comms: “Station Sec, your team has ninety seconds before I vent the *outer* side. I’m not dying in a can.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m not getting boxed between doors while that thing probes up through the deck. I need space, hard separation, and to keep the contamination out of Dock 9—so I’ll use the antechamber as a kill zone, force the inner door shut, and prep to vent the outer side if it breaches.*

### Turn 149 [GAME]

You shove into the antechamber. The inner viewport frames Dock Guard #2—wide-eyed, rifle half-raised. When you snarl at him to keep the inner door sealed, he nods once, sharp and automatic, and takes another step back from the glass.

“Copy,” he says, voice thin. “Inner stays shut.”

You slap the antechamber control panel for **CLOSE / HARD-LOCK OUTER**.

The panel accepts **CLOSE**. The outer hatch begins to iris shut with a grinding whine—then the motion stutters. The indicator flips to amber: **OBSTRUCTION / SEAL CONTACT**.

Through the narrowing gap you see why: the black ooze has reached the hatch rim and is spread in a thin, glossy sheet across the contact edge. As the door closes, it **strings** like tar, forming conductive-looking filaments between the moving petals and the frame. The hatch tries to complete the seal, fails, backs off a fraction, then tries again—each attempt smearing more of it into the mechanism.

The hard-lock command throws a harsh buzzer: **LOCKOUT — SEAL INCOMPLETE**.

Outside, the deck breach you stomped is no longer the only one. In the corridor beyond the outer hatch, three separate deckplate blisters rise and fall in sequence—like something pacing under the floor. One of them pops and a pale segmented limb flicks up and slaps the deck twice, then vanishes.

You brace with the rifle on the seam line. The antechamber vibrates as the hatch motor strains against the obstruction.

Comms: “Station Sec, your team has ninety seconds before I vent the outer side. I’m not dying in a can.”

Station Sec comes back immediately, no patience left. “Vance, do not touch vent controls. Containment is en route—one minute. If you vent, you’ll spread debris and whatever’s in that corridor across the dock structure. Hold position.”

Pell cuts in over the same band, too calm: “Mara, you’re making it worse. Stop cycling the hatch.”

Dock Guard #2, behind the inner door, raises his rifle properly now—but he’s aiming it low, not at you. At the **floor seam** inside Dock 9, as if he’s suddenly realized the problem might not respect doors.

The outer hatch shudders. The gap is still open by a few centimeters—enough for cold air to leak and for something thin to probe through if it tries. The ooze continues to creep along the hatch edge, actively preventing a full seal.

### Turn 150 [PLAYER]

I hit the panel to STOP the outer hatch motor, then yank a chem-flare from my kit, crack it, and jam the burning end toward the ooze strings on the hatch rim to scorch them off.  

I bark through the viewport at Guard #2: “Back off that floor seam and keep your muzzle up—if it comes through, shoot to shred, not to scare.”  

Into comms: “Sec, if your containment has foam or freeze spray, tell them to sprint it here—this stuff’s jamming the seal. Pell, shut up unless you’re sending tools.”

*Agent reasoning: The outer hatch won’t seal because the ooze is bridging the contacts; forcing it will just smear more and jam us. I need to stop the motor, remove/kill the conductive film at the rim, then either seal or, if it surges, vent the corridor side. Fire and cutting are my fastest tools.*

### Turn 151 [GAME]

You slap **STOP**. The hatch motor winds down with a protesting whine and goes still. The outer iris is left **partially open**—a crescent gap of hard vacuum-dark beyond, rimmed with frost and those glossy black strings stretched between petal and frame.

You yank a chem-flare, crack it. The flare blooms harsh white-orange, spitting sparks. Heat slaps your visor.

You jam the burning end toward the ooze on the hatch rim.

The black strings **don’t ignite**. They **shrink away** from the heat in a slow, syrupy recoil—then **snap back** when you pull the flare off, as if elastic. Where the flame licks the metal, the ooze leaves behind a **thin, soot-black varnish** that looks baked onto the rim. The varnish immediately starts to **bead** and re-wet, rebuilding filaments across the gap.

Worse: the heat drives a sharp chemical stench into the antechamber—burnt coolant and something like singed hair. Your suit’s air monitor pings: **VOLATILE ORGANICS — TRACE**. Not lethal, but now you’re breathing contamination through filters.

Outside the gap, a pale segmented limb flicks up—fast—toward the light. It doesn’t reach you; it **twitches** at the flare’s glow like a moth at a bulb, then slaps the deck and vanishes. A second later, something **scrapes** along the underside of the hatch petals from the corridor side—testing the mechanism you just stopped.

You bark at Guard #2. He flinches, then obeys: backs off the Dock 9 floor seam, plants his feet wider, and brings his muzzle up to cover the inner door and the seam alternately. “Copy—shred,” he says, voice tight. He thumbs his selector with an audible click.

Comms: you demand foam or freeze.

Station Sec: “Containment team has cryo-foam. Thirty seconds to your position. Do not reopen the hatch—hold.”

Pell, clipped now: “Tools are inbound. And Vance—don’t burn it. You’re polymerizing it.”

As if to underline that, the ooze on the hatch rim thickens into a **tougher-looking skin** where you heated it. The filaments spanning the gap become fewer—but **stiffer**, like wire.

Then the antechamber floor vibrates once—hard—like something struck the corridor deckplate with a shoulder.

The partially open outer hatch gives a tiny involuntary **tick** in its track.

### Turn 152 [PLAYER]

I kill the flare and stomp it out, then rip a maintenance rag/cloth from my kit and shove it into the crescent gap as a crude gasket, using the butt of my rifle to pack it tight without getting my taped arm near the rim.  

I bark into comms: “Containment—hit the hatch rim first, then the deck outside. Dock Control, on my call you CLOSE and LOCK—don’t argue.”  

I square up on the gap, rifle on full-auto, and growl at Guard #2 through the viewport, “If I go down, you keep that inner door shut. Clear?”

*Agent reasoning: The ooze is locking the hatch and heat made it worse; I need to stop feeding it and buy seconds until cryo-foam arrives. Best move is to block the gap mechanically, aim for anything that tries to push through, and prep for a fast seal once foam hits.*

### Turn 153 [GAME]

You kill the flare and grind it under your boot until the hiss dies. The light drops out of the antechamber, leaving only emergency strips and your weapon lamp.

You rip a maintenance cloth from your kit and shove it into the crescent gap.

The cloth catches immediately on the ooze-slick rim. When you drive it in with the rifle butt, it **packs**, but not like a gasket—like a wick. The black varnish you baked into the metal **soaks into the fibers** in a spreading stain, turning the cloth heavy and glossy. For two seconds the airflow hiss **dampens** and the gap looks “plugged.”

Then the cloth **twitches**.

Not from vacuum pull—from below. Something in the corridor side hooks it and drags. The packed cloth pulls outward a centimeter, then stops as you ram it back in with the rifle butt. The ooze strings reform around it, binding cloth to metal like adhesive.

Your panel chirps: **SEAL CONTACT IMPROVED (PARTIAL)** — but it’s still amber, still not lockable.

You bark orders into comms.

Containment team lead (new voice, close and running): “Copy. Cryo-foam on rim first. We’re at Dock 9 tube—ten seconds.”

Dock Control, strained: “Understood. Awaiting your call to close.”

Through the viewport, Guard #2 swallows hard. When you growl that if you go down he keeps the inner door shut, he answers without hesitation: “Clear. Inner stays sealed.” He reaches up and slaps the manual deadbolt lever into place; you see the red indicator flip to **MECH LOCK**.

Outside the gap, the deck in the corridor **hammers** once—louder than before. The partially open hatch petals flex in their tracks. The cloth you stuffed in the gap jerks again, harder, as if something is now **pulling steadily** from the other side.

A pale segmented limb snakes up into the crescent opening—thin enough to fit—feeling along the cloth with quick taps. It doesn’t shove through yet. It’s **testing the plug**, finding purchase.

Your rifle is up on full-auto, muzzle steady on the gap. If you fire, you’ll shred the limb—but you’ll also shred your cloth plug and spray whatever fluid is in there across the rim and into the antechamber.

Footsteps and the clatter of gear hit the boarding tube behind you: containment is arriving at the inner door side, stacking up just out of your view.

I plant my boot on the cloth plug to pin it and smash the rifle butt down on the probing limb to break it without perforating anything.  

I shout at the containment lead through comms, “Now—foam the rim through the gap, bury that limb, then I call Dock Control to close. Move!”  

To Dock Control: “On my mark—CLOSE. Mark will be ‘FOAMED.’”

I key Dock Control. “On my mark—CLOSE. Mark is ‘FOAMED.’”

*Agent reasoning: The limb’s probing the plug; shooting risks aerosolizing goo inside the antechamber. I’ll pin the cloth, break the limb with blunt force, and force containment to foam the rim so Dock Control can finally close and lock.*

### Turn 157 [GAME]

Your boot comes down hard on the stuffed cloth. It holds—barely—squishing slick and cold under your sole like a saturated sponge. The ooze has glued it to the rim; it doesn’t slip free.

You bring the rifle butt down on the probing segmented limb.

Impact lands clean. The limb doesn’t “bone-snap”—it **crushes** with a wet, brittle give, like a bundle of hollow straws. A clear-gray fluid spatters the rim and your boot tread. The limb spasms once, then goes slack.

But the thing is anchored on the other side. When you lift the rifle butt, the crushed segment **recoils backward**—and it doesn’t just retreat. It **yanks**.

The cloth plug jerks outward under your boot. You feel it try to slide; the ooze-adhesive stretches into black strings, fighting you. The crescent gap opens a few millimeters wider before your weight pins it again. A thin **knife-hiss** of pressure equalization cuts through the antechamber.

Containment lead, right on top of you now (voice loud over comms, breathy): “On it—stand by—FOAM!”

A nozzle shoves into the inner side of the hatch frame, angled toward the crescent. White cryo-foam blasts through the gap in a hard stream, splattering rim, cloth, and the slack limb.

The effect is immediate and ugly: the ooze **seizes**. It goes from glossy to matte-black in a heartbeat, then **frosts over**. The limb locks in place half-in/half-out, entombed in expanding white foam.

Then the foam hits whatever’s on the corridor deck.

A heavy shape outside **thrashes** once—violent enough to make the hatch petals rattle. The frozen ooze on the rim **cracks**, spiderwebbing. The cloth under your boot stiffens as the foam saturates it, turning into a rigid wedge.

Containment lead barks to his team: “Keep it on the rim—don’t chase it—build a collar!”

Dock Control comes back in your ear, tight and ready: “Closing sequence armed. Awaiting mark.”

The threat is now clear: there is **something strong** on the corridor side, close enough to strike the hatch and pull at the gap. The foam is buying you seconds, but the rim material is starting to fracture under stress.

The containment lead shouts over comms, “RIM IS FOAMED—RIM IS FOAMED!”

### Turn 158 [PLAYER]

“FOAMED!” I bark into comms. “Dock Control—CLOSE AND LOCK, NOW!”

I shove back off the hatch line, dragging the containment nozzle operator with me by the shoulder strap, and level my rifle at the seam, finger ready—“Everyone clear the door! If it blows, I’m not catching shrapnel for you.”

*Agent reasoning: The rim’s foamed and cracking—waiting gets us ripped open. Best move is slam the hatch shut now while the foam’s locking things in, then get everyone off the door in case it bucks or vents.*

### Turn 159 [GAME]

“FOAMED!” hits the comms.

Dock Control doesn’t answer with words—your antechamber fills with the mechanical whine of actuators. The inner-side control collar on the hatch frame lights from amber to **closing red**.

The hatch petals start to travel.

For half a second, it looks like it’ll seat clean: the foam-collar compresses, the rigid cloth wedge grinds, and the crescent gap narrows.

Then something on the corridor side **hits the hatch**—a full-body slam. The petals shudder in their tracks. The frozen black on the rim **shears**; chips of ice-black residue spall off and ping against the antechamber deck. The crushed limb, entombed in foam, **snaps off** at the seam and disappears back through the shrinking gap like it’s being reeled in.

You yank the nozzle operator by the shoulder strap. He stumbles hard, almost drops the gun, then lets it go and scrambles backward on hands and knees, white foam still drooling from the nozzle line. “Clear! Clear!” he yells, getting behind the inner bulkhead lip.

Containment lead physically shoves one of his own techs out of the hatch’s line of travel. “BACK—NOW!”

The petals keep closing—grinding, protesting. Your visor flashes **OBSTRUCTION / HIGH TORQUE**.

At the last inch, the hatch **stalls**. The seam is nearly shut, but not seated. A thin, pulsing line of darkness remains—just wide enough to breathe through.

From that line, a sound leaks: not air, not scraping—**a wet, rhythmic clicking**, like a joint testing its range.

Dock Control, strained: “We’re at max torque. Lock won’t engage until seated. Do you want me to override and force—risking track failure?”

The hatch is almost closed but not locked. Whatever is outside is still pressed close enough to keep it from seating—and it has just demonstrated it can hit hard enough to crack frozen material and jam mechanisms.

### Turn 160 [PLAYER]

I key Dock Control. “Override—FORCE IT. If the track fails, we weld it shut from our side.”

I wave containment back and jab a finger at the seam. “Dump foam right into that breathing line—fill it until it chokes.” Then I plant myself off-angle and fire a short burst into the gap to shred whatever’s clicking in there.

*Agent reasoning: If it’s almost seated, we need brute force now—force the track and then reinforce the inner side. Leaving it unsealed is worse than damaging the mechanism.*

### Turn 161 [GAME]

Dock Control doesn’t hesitate. “Override acknowledged—forcing.”

The hatch drive note drops into a harsher pitch. The petals lurch a fraction inward—metal complaining, track rollers hammering.

You point. “Foam the line!”

The nozzle operator crawls up just enough to reach, braces the barrel against the inner frame, and squeezes. Foam jets straight into the thin seam. It packs fast, expanding into a white cord that bulges and then gets **sucked** in pulses, like something outside is inhaling through it.

The clicking changes cadence—faster, irritated.

You plant off-angle and fire a short burst into the gap.

Muzzle flash lights the antechamber in staccato. Rounds punch into the foam cord and the seam beyond. The first two shots disappear into expanding foam; the next ones strike something hard-and-wet. There’s a sharp **chitin pop**, then a spray of gray-clear fluid that spatters the inner hatch frame and freckles your visor.

The clicking stops for a beat.

Then the seam **kicks** outward—like a knee against a door. Not enough to reopen, but enough to jar the petals in the track. Your visor flashes: **TRACK SLIP / MISALIGNMENT**.

Dock Control swears, open-mic: “Track’s walking—hold—” The drive forces again.

A grinding bang echoes through the tube as the petals finally **crush** inward that last fraction. The foam cord compresses into a flat gasket. For an instant, you think it’s seated—

—then the hatch gives a violent shudder and the left-side track **fails** with a metallic shriek. One petal drops a centimeter out of plane. The seam does not reopen wide, but it becomes an uneven zig: tight in the center, wider at the lower left.

Through that lower-left notch, something **threads**: a thin, segmented feeler, slick with gray fluid, probing blindly along the foam-smeared edge.

Containment lead snaps, “NO—back, back!” and grabs the nozzle operator by the harness, hauling him away from the seam.

Dock Control, breathing hard: “Override halted. Lock still won’t engage. You’ve got a partial close with a misaligned petal. If you keep forcing, you may tear the whole leaf off.”

The threat is now specific and immediate: the hatch is jammed partially shut, not lockable, with a small notch open—large enough for a probing appendage to enter and potentially widen under force.

### Turn 162 [PLAYER]

I snap my rifle down and stomp forward, bringing the boot heel down on the probing feeler to pin it, then I knife it off with my bayonet in a brutal saw to stop it anchoring.  

“Containment—pack that lower-left notch solid. All foam, then slap a patch plate over it if you’ve got one.”  

I key Dock Control. “Stop forcing. Get me a welder and a brace team at this hatch—now. We’re sealing it from our side.”

*Agent reasoning: Forcing the hatch more risks a full failure; the notch is the immediate threat. Best move is to immobilize/deny the opening with a hard plug and then secure the door from our side—weld/brace—while keeping the feeler from gaining purchase.*

### Turn 164 [PLAYER]

I lunge in and bring my heel down on the probing feeler to pin it, then saw it off with my bayonet at the notch—messy and fast.  

“Containment, pack that lower-left notch solid—ALL foam. If you’ve got a patch plate, slap it over.”  

I key Dock Control. “Stop forcing. Send a welder and a brace team to this hatch—now. We’re sealing it from our side.”

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is jammed and a feeler is already probing through the notch—if I let it anchor, we’re done. I need to immobilize and remove it fast, then hard-seal the notch with foam and a plate while Dock brings welding gear and bracing.*

### Turn 165 [GAME]

Your heel comes down on the segmented feeler right at the lower-left notch.

It doesn’t squish like flesh. It **cracks** like layered plastic, then flexes and tries to snake sideways under your boot, searching for purchase along the foam-slick metal. You grind down harder until it stops moving.

You jam the bayonet into the notch and saw.

The blade bites, grates, then suddenly gives—**a wet snap**. Gray-clear fluid jets out in a short pulse, spattering your boot and the hatch lip. The severed tip whips once and goes limp, still twitching in tiny reflexes against the foam.

The part you didn’t get—the “root”—**yanks back** through the notch with enough force to drag a ribbon of foam with it. The foam plug you’d started is now torn into a ragged channel again.

Containment doesn’t need a second order. The nozzle operator, face white under his visor, crawls up from the safe angle and dumps foam into the lower-left gap until it bulges outward. Another tech slaps a quick-seal patch from his kit over the bulge—but it’s made for pinholes, not a stressed notch. The adhesive grabs, then immediately starts to **peel at one corner** as pressure from the other side pulses against it.

“Patch won’t hold on shear!” the tech barks, palms flat, trying to keep it seated. “Need a hard plate or a brace!”

Dock Control answers your key: “Forcing stopped. Welder team en route—fastest ETA three minutes. Brace crew behind them.”

Three minutes is an eternity here.

The hatch shudders once—testing. Not a slam this time, a **steady push**. The misaligned petal creaks, and the patched corner lifts another millimeter. Through the foam you see a thin **dark line** form under the patch edge, like something is prying a fingernail under it.

Then the clicking returns—closer than before—no longer outside the corridor. It’s coming from **inside the seam**, as if whatever’s there has gotten its mouthparts into the notch and is working the material.

Containment lead steps in front of his people with a cutter he shouldn’t have on a dock. “Mara—if that patch lets go, it’s coming through at knee height.”

The immediate threat is the lower-left notch: the foam is being pulled and pulsed from the far side, the patch is peeling, and something is actively prying at the seam while you wait on welders.

“Brace it NOW—manual! Get me anything rigid: pry bar, stanchion, tool case—jam it into that lower-left corner and hold pressure inward.”

I step in off-angle, rip the peeling patch free, and ram my bayonet deep into the notch like a wedge, twisting to pin whatever’s clicking; then I dump a full mag in short, controlled bursts straight into the gap through the foam until it goes quiet.

*Agent reasoning: Three minutes is too long; the patch is failing and the thing is prying now. I need an immediate hard brace and to kill whatever is working the seam, even if it’s ugly and risks the hatch.*

“Brace it NOW—manual! Anything rigid: pry bar, stanchion, tool case—jam it into that lower-left corner and hold pressure inward.”

I step in off-angle, rip the peeling patch free, and drive my bayonet deep into the notch as a wedge, twisting to pin whatever’s clicking; then I dump a full mag in short, controlled bursts straight into the gap through the foam until it goes quiet.

*Agent reasoning: The notch is actively being worked open; waiting three minutes gets people killed. I’ll physically jam the seam, then pour fire into the gap to stop whatever’s prying while containment braces it with anything rigid.*

### Turn 169 [GAME]

Containment scrambles instantly.

A dockhand rips a **stanchion post** out of its base and two others shove a **tool case** up under it to get the angle. They drive the post into the lower-left corner of the hatch frame and lean their combined weight inward. Metal shrieks. The hatch’s petal stops creeping—barely.

You tear the peeling patch free. The adhesive comes off in a long string, snapping back onto your glove.

Off-angle, you slam the bayonet into the foam-packed notch and twist hard.

For a half-second it feels like you’ve found purchase—then the bayonet point hits something that **moves against the steel**, not away from it. The clicking spikes into a rapid chatter, right up the blade. Your wrist jolts as if something bit down on the metal.

You fire.

Short bursts. Controlled. The muzzle flash strobes the foam into dirty white chunks. The rounds don’t “ping” like they’re hitting empty void—they thud and **skip**, as if striking layered composite and wet metal. Gray-clear fluid erupts again, atomized into a mist that coats the foam and your forearm.

Then: **silence** from the notch. No clicking.

But the consequences land immediately.

The foam you just shot through **slumps** and starts to dissolve where the fluid hit it, turning to a slick, sagging paste. A thin stream runs down the hatch lip and onto the deck, smoking faintly as it reacts with grime. The bayonet is still wedged—now vibrating in tiny, diminishing tremors like a tuning fork.

Dock Guard #2, who’d moved in to help brace, jerks back as the runoff touches his boot. “Shit—burn!” He hops, swearing, and one of the containment techs drags him away before he slips in it.

The stanchion team yells over each other:
“Pressure’s changing!”
“It’s pulling—no, it’s *setting*—”
The hatch doesn’t push anymore. It goes **dead weight**, like whatever was on the other side stopped pressing entirely.

Then a new sound replaces it: a **slow creak** from higher on the hatch seam—upper-right quadrant—like tension migrating. The braced corner holds, but the stress line has shifted.

Dock Control cuts back in your ear, tight: “Welder team at Tube 9 junction—ninety seconds.”

Right now the threat isn’t the notch you silenced; it’s the hatch **redistributing force**. If the upper-right seam gives, it’ll open a new gap above the brace line—head height—without warning.

### Turn 170 [PLAYER]

“Everyone off the hatch face—NOW. Brace team, keep that stanchion but get low and to the side; nobody stands in front of the seam.”

I point up at the upper-right quadrant. “You—get a second stanchion or pry bar up there and wedge it. Tool case, crate, whatever—build a jack stack.”

I backstep to a hard angle, rifle up on the upper-right seam. “If it opens, I’m shooting the first thing that shows—don’t cross my line. Dock Control, welder team comes in on my left only.”

*Agent reasoning: New gap risk at head height means someone’s getting sliced open if it pops; I need bodies out of the kill zone, a brace up high, and eyes on that seam until the welders arrive.*

### Turn 171 [GAME]

People move the moment you bark it.

Containment lead shoves two techs backward by their harness rings. “Off the face! Low, low—sidewall!” The brace team keeps the lower-left stanchion planted but drops to a crouch behind it, shoulders turned away from the seam. The tool case stack stays, but one guy kicks it tighter under the post so it can’t skate on the slick runoff.

A dockhand sprints for more gear—comes back dragging a second stanchion and a length of pry bar scavenged from a maintenance cart. They start building a “jack stack” under the upper-right: crate, then a hard case, then the stanchion angled up to bite the frame. It’s improvisation—good instinct, bad materials. The stack wobbles once, then steadies as two bodies pin it from the side.

You backstep to a hard angle and bring the rifle up on the upper-right seam.

Dock Control, breathy and fast in your ear: “Copy. Welder team routed left approach only. They’re moving.”

The upper-right seam gives a sound like a ship’s rib cracking—**a long, wet metal groan**. A hairline gap opens there, not wide—two fingers at most—but it’s enough.

Something extrudes.

Not a limb this time. A **thin, flat strip**, like a laminate tongue or a cable sheath, slides out and hangs for a beat—then **splits** into three filaments at the end, tasting the air. It doesn’t rush. It *samples*, sweeping side to side, pausing whenever it points toward a warm body.

One of the brace guys, crouched too close, flinches and shifts his knee. The filament snaps toward the motion with a sharp, insectile **tick** and taps the hull—*tick-tick*—as if mapping.

Containment lead hisses, “Don’t move. Don’t—”

The new upper-right brace stack shudders as pressure changes behind the hatch. The stanchion head bites, then slips a millimeter, leaving a bright gouge in the frame. The gap widens a fraction more.

Welder team appears at your left corridor mouth—two in arc hoods, one carrying a plate, all of them stopping dead when they see the thing in the seam.

The threat is now **a probing appendage** actively searching and a seam that is **opening at head height**; if it finds purchase, it can pull the gap wider faster than your braces can hold.

### Turn 172 [PLAYER]

I put two tight bursts into the filament cluster right at the split, then a third burst into the seam behind it to chew away anything trying to anchor. “Welders—plate OVER that gap, tack it NOW; I don’t care if it’s ugly. Brace team, shove that upper stanchion harder—make it bite.”

*Agent reasoning: That probe is scouting for leverage; if it finds purchase we lose the seam. I’ll kill it fast, then force the welders to plate and tack immediately while braces hold—no hesitation.*

### Turn 173 [GAME]

Your first two bursts hit the filament cluster right at the split.

The filaments don’t spray blood; they **snap and fray** like layered polymer under heat, whipping back into the seam. The impact makes a sound like wet tape tearing. A clear-gray mist puffs out with it—same reactive fluid as before—spattering the hatch face in a constellation of droplets.

Your third burst goes into the seam behind it.

The rounds chew the edge of the hatch frame and whatever’s just inside. You feel it in the recoil: not empty space—**dense resistance**, then a sudden give. The gap widens by a sliver under the shock, and something inside **pulls back** hard, like it just lost grip.

For half a breath, it looks like you bought space.

Then the runoff fluid hits the upper brace stack. It doesn’t ignite; it **eats**. The top hard case hisses and softens where droplets land, its corner deforming, shifting the stanchion’s angle. The brace team shoves harder as you order, boots sliding on the slick deck—one guy drops to a knee to get leverage, gritting, “It’s moving—keep it—KEEP IT—”

The welders move on your left, fast and disciplined. The Team Lead slaps a plate up over the breach with insulated gloves. “Arc on—stand clear!”

He strikes. The arc flares blue-white, and the first tack *sticks*—then immediately **pops**, spitting molten metal as the plate vibrates from pressure behind it. The second tack holds for a second longer, drawing a bead—

—and the seam **exhales**.

Not air. A pulse of that clear-gray vapor and fine particulate blasts out around the plate edges, forcing the welder’s hood back with a sharp *clack*. Both techs stagger, coughing inside their masks. The bead goes ugly, blistering as if the metal is contaminated.

Behind the plate, you hear the clicking again—faster now, excited—coming from *two points*: the original notch you “silenced” and the upper-right, answering each other like call-and-response.

Threat, clear: your fire drove the probe back, but the breach is now **actively pressurizing and venting reactive vapor** that degrades supports and fouls welds, and the thing behind the hatch has **multiple contact points**—it can shift where it pushes faster than your braces can be rebuilt.

### Turn 174 [PLAYER]

“Welders, STOP—back out, masks on, you’re breathing poison. Everyone fall back to the junction—now!”

I key Dock Control. “We need hard plates and mechanical clamps—hatch dog bars, cargo straps, anything that can cinch steel. And purge this section: vent the corridor to vacuum if you can, scrubbers max if you can’t.”

I jab the rifle toward the hatch. “Brace team, hold until the last second—then peel off left. If anything comes through, I’m cutting it in half. Move!”

*Agent reasoning: The vapor is eating supports and ruining welds; holding this hatch is failing. I need to pull people back, isolate the area, and switch to a more brute-force seal: hard plates plus mechanical clamps, then vent/purge the corridor.*

### Turn 175 [GAME]

The welders obey immediately.

Team Lead chops the arc. “Off! Off!” He yanks his hood seal tighter and physically shoves Tech #1 back by the shoulder. Both techs retreat left, coughing hard—wet, panicked coughs inside their masks. One spits into his sleeve and looks at the smear on the fabric like he doesn’t understand what he’s seeing.

Containment lead starts herding everyone toward the junction, palms out. “Back! Don’t run—don’t slip in that shit!”

Your order to fall back works—mostly. People peel off in a staggered line, staying out of your lane.

Dock Control comes back sharp, with real strain in it: “Negative on vent-to-vacuum from Dock 9 tube. That corridor is tied into station pressure integrity—if I dump it, I dump half the spindle ring. I can max scrubbers and isolate local returns. Clamps and dog bars inbound—cargo crew is stripping Bay 4 tie-downs now. ETA three minutes.”

At the hatch, the brace team holds as told—two crouched behind the lower-left stanchion, two pinning the upper-right improvised stack.

The reactive vapor keeps seeping around the ugly tack-welded plate—thin, pulsing breaths. Each pulse makes the plate **tick** and flex like a drum skin. The clear-gray residue continues to bead and run; where it touches the upper stack, the hard case corner slumps further, and the stanchion angle changes again—less bite, more slide.

Then the clicking changes character: it stops being “from the seam” and becomes **inside the hatch frame**, like something has moved into the thickness of the metal.

A new sound follows: a slow, deliberate **ratcheting**—as if teeth are climbing the hatch dogs from the inside.

Brace guy on the upper stack blurts, voice cracking, “It’s not pushing— it’s *unlatching*—”

The upper-right brace slips another centimeter. The plate jerks outward at the top edge, and a **dark line** appears behind it—an inner gap widening.

Your retreat order creates distance, but the threat escalates: whatever is behind the hatch is now **working the hatch hardware**, and the compromised upper brace is losing its bite under chemical degradation. If the hatch dogs release, the hatch won’t “creep” anymore—it will **snap open** under stored pressure, sending the plate and any nearby bodies into the corridor like shrapnel.

### Turn 176 [PLAYER]

“Brace team, ABANDON—left, NOW! Everybody to the junction, heads down!”

I sprint in low on the hinge side, slam my bayonet into the dog track through the widening upper-right gap to jam the ratchet, then immediately peel back and dump a burst into the hatch dog housing to try to shred the mechanism. “Control—get me an emergency bulkhead door between us and that hatch, NOW!”

*Agent reasoning: It’s about to snap open; waiting for clamps is death. I need to deny the hatch hardware—either jam the dogs or destroy the mechanism—and get my people clear before it blows.*

### Turn 177 [GAME]

“ABANDON—left, NOW!” gets answered with pure survival.

The upper brace pair breaks first—hands off, bodies sliding left on the slick deck. One nearly goes down; the containment lead catches his harness and yanks him upright. The lower-left brace team peels a half-second later, stanchion clanging as it’s left behind.

That half-second is all you have.

You sprint in low on the hinge side. The upper-right gap is now wide enough to see the dog track—metal teeth and a moving pawl, working itself free with that slow ratchet. You drive the bayonet in hard.

It *catches*.

The ratcheting stops dead with a metallic **clunk** that you feel up your arm. For a heartbeat, the whole hatch face shudders—pressure loading against your jam.

Then something on the other side **tests** it: a heavy, controlled push. The bayonet flexes. Your glove vibrates on the hilt like it’s pressed against a running motor.

You peel back as you planned and dump a burst into the dog housing.

Rounds punch into the frame—sparks, torn alloy, and a spray of that clear-gray residue kicked out by impacts. The housing deforms; the hatch dogs *don’t* finish unlatching, but the mechanism is now partially shredded and **misaligned**. It won’t cycle cleanly either way.

Consequence: the hatch doesn’t snap open… but it also doesn’t seal. It’s stuck in a dangerous middle state: jammed and damaged, holding pressure in uneven pulses.

The ugly-welded plate over the upper-right breach tears loose at one corner from the next “exhale” and whips outward, clanging off the abandoned stanchion and skittering across the deck toward the junction like a thrown shield. It stops short of the retreating crew by a meter, spinning to a halt.

One welder screams, “Plate! PLATE!” and ducks behind the junction bulkhead lip.

Dock Control, strained: “Emergency bulkhead is two sections back—manual close only. I can’t drop anything between you and that hatch from here. Closest is Junction 3A-19 iris—if you’re at it, you can slam it.”

At the hatch, behind the jammed dogs, you hear a new sound: a **thin scraping** along the inside of the frame, moving away from the dog track—like it’s changing approach. The clear-gray vapor continues to pulse out around your bullet holes and the widened seam, drifting low along the deck toward you and the junction.

Threat, explicit: the hatch is **no longer opening normally**, but whatever’s inside is still active and now probing for another weak point; meanwhile the corridor is accumulating **reactive vapor** that’s spreading toward your fallback position.

I backpedal with the rifle up, covering the hatch, and bark to Dock Control, “I’m at 3A-19—cycle it shut the instant we’re clear, then isolate this run and crank scrubbers. If you can’t vent, flood it with inert.”

As the last person clears, I grab the manual close and slam the iris down, then post up on the safe side with the muzzle trained on the seam line. “Nobody opens that door for anything.”

*Agent reasoning: The vapor’s spreading and the hatch is stuck but still active; the only real containment is slamming the iris and isolating the section. I’ll force everyone behind it, then shut it and vent/flush this corridor. If something darts out before closure, I’ll hose it down while moving.*

### Turn 179 [GAME]

They move.

Your arm sweep and tone cut through the panic; the welders and brace team funnel past you toward Junction 3A-19, heads down, hands over mask seals. One of the Helix cargo hands tries to look back; the containment lead hooks his vest and yanks him forward. “Eyes front—MOVE.”

You backpedal with the rifle up. The vapor is pooling low now, a knee-high haze that curls around boots and the abandoned stanchion legs. It doesn’t burn your visor, but your suit’s external chem sensor starts throwing intermittent *VOC/unknown reactive* spikes—enough to justify the urgency.

Dock Control answers over the channel, voice tight: “Copy. Isolating local returns and pushing scrubbers to max. Inert flood available—stand by to confirm seal at 3A-19.”

The last welder clears the iris—Tech #2—half-stumbling, one hand clamped to his throat mic like he’s trying not to cough. You grab the manual close and throw your weight into it.

The iris **drops and locks** with a heavy, satisfying *thoom* and a ring of latches snapping home. The seam line around the door flickers with a status strip: amber to green. Pressure equalizes on your side with a soft hiss; the haze on your side thins as the scrubbers bite.

On the far side of the iris—muffled through the door—you hear it: a single, deliberate **impact** against metal, like a shoulder test. Then a second, slightly higher, as if whatever’s there is mapping the iris’s ribs.

A voice crackles on your comms—Dock Guard #2, somewhere behind you at the junction, weapon up: “Vance, we’re sealed. But… you should see this.”

He angles his light down at the deck plating by your boots.

In the condensation and residue, a fresh **handprint** has appeared on *your* side of the iris—oil-black, partial, smeared as if pressed from the inside of the metal. Five long finger marks, too narrow at the joints. It wasn’t there when you slammed the door.

Dock Control: “Seal confirmed. Inert flood commencing on the isolated run. You are green on station side. Do **not** cycle that iris.”

Threat is immediate and concrete: something remains active on the isolated side and is now testing the barrier, while evidence (the handprint) suggests contamination or contact has already crossed the seal—whether through vapor, residue, or something worse.

### Turn 180 [PLAYER]

I snap my rifle up and sweep the floor-to-waistline around the iris, then jab a finger at the print. “Nobody steps in that residue—back up, now. Guard, tape off a five-meter arc; guns on the door, low angle.”

I key Dock Control. “That iris is leaking or something’s already through—get HazMat and a chem/biomed scan team here, and lock down Junction 3A-19 on both sides. Flood this side with inert too if you can without dropping O2.”

I crouch and flick my suit light across the handprint and the seam, looking for smears, tracks, or anything moving. “Containment lead—count heads and check suits. Anybody coughing or with a compromised seal goes to med quarantine immediately.”

*Agent reasoning: That handprint means it’s already on our side or the seal is compromised; I’m not waiting for it to “test” again. I need containment, scans, and a kill zone—fast.*

### Turn 182 [PLAYER]

I keep my rifle trained low on the iris seam and bark, “Nobody crosses that print—back up five meters, weapons on the door.”  

I key Dock Control. “Status update—are you flooding the isolated run? I need HazMat and a scan team at Junction 3A-19 now, and lock this junction down both sides.”  

I crouch, sweep my suit light along the seam and the black handprint, looking for wet sheen, airflow, smears, or any tracks leading away. “Containment lead—count heads and check seals. Anyone coughing or with a bad mask goes straight to med quarantine.”

*Agent reasoning: The scene didn’t update, so I’ll reassert immediate containment orders and demand status from Dock Control while I physically inspect the iris/seal for leaks or residue trails.*

### Turn 183 [GAME]

Your order lands. People actually listen.

Dock Guard #2 backs up first, boots squeaking on the damp deck, then throws out a roll of hazard tape from his belt kit. He anchors it to a conduit bracket and makes a quick five‑meter arc around the iris, keeping his pistol low and steady. “Five meters. Nobody crosses,” he repeats, eyes fixed on the seam.

The containment lead starts counting out loud, physically grabbing shoulders and checking faceplates and suit rings with a gloved hand. “Nine… ten… eleven… Tech Two, visor seal—hold still.” Tech #2’s breathing is fast and wet in his mic; not a full cough, but close. The lead points hard toward the corridor back to station-side med. “You. Quarantine. Now. Escort him.”

Dock Control comes back immediately. “Isolated run is flooding inert now—argon mix. Scrubbers at max. Lockdown on both sides of 3A-19 is in progress; I can hard-lock the station-side access in thirty seconds. HazMat team is en route, ETA four minutes—biomed scanner with them. Do you need us to inert-flood *your* side?” There’s a pause, then: “Be advised: inert on your side will drop O2 partial. You’ll need masks sealed or suit feed.”

You crouch and rake your light along the iris seam and the oil-black print.

Concrete: the print has a wet sheen that **shouldn’t** be there in this cold air. Under the beam it glitters like thin oil, and you can see a faint *drag*—a narrow smear leading away from the palm toward the left, about thirty centimeters, then stopping as if whatever made it lifted clean.

At the bottom of the iris seam, your light catches something worse: a **steady, tiny stream of vapor** feathering out—more like breath through a pinhole than residual haze. It curls along the deck and *threads* toward the handprint, as if drawn to it.

On the other side of the door, the impacts stop. Replaced by a slow, rasping **scrape** that travels downward along the iris ribs, ending near that same bottom seam—like something aligning itself with the leak.

Threat, explicit: the iris is not a perfect seal; there is an active **leak path** at the lower seam, and whatever is on the far side has noticed it and is working that exact point while inert flooding continues behind it.

### Turn 184 [PLAYER]

I jab two fingers at Dock Guard #2. “You—keep that arc tight. If anything oozes under that seam, you shoot it. Low angle only.”

I key Dock Control. “Don’t inert-flood our side yet. I need pressure on my side *higher* than the isolated run—give me a slight overpress and push scrubbers; I’m sealing a leak at the bottom seam. And kill power to that iris actuator—hard lock only.”

I rip a roll of seal tape/patch from the nearest kit and slap it over the bottom seam, then brace my boot and hammer a maintenance wedge or prybar into the seam lip to crimp it shut. “Containment lead—get everyone another ten meters back and seal masks. HazMat better bring a damn torch.”

*Agent reasoning: There’s a leak at the bottom seam and something is targeting it; waiting four minutes is asking to get breached. I need to hard-seal the seam fast with brute force and keep everyone back, then get atmosphere control to help without asphyxiating us.*

### Turn 186 [PLAYER]

I jab two fingers at Dock Guard #2. “Hold that five-meter arc. If anything oozes under that seam, you put rounds into it—low angle only.”

I key Dock Control. “No inert flood on our side. Give me slight overpressure station-side and max scrubbers; and kill power to the iris actuator—hard lock only.”

I rip seal tape from the nearest kit and slap a patch over the bottom seam, then drive a maintenance wedge/prybar into the seam lip and crank it to crimp the leak shut. “Containment lead—everyone ten meters back, masks sealed. HazMat better show up ready to cut metal.”

*Agent reasoning: We’ve got an active leak at the bottom seam and something on the other side is working it. I’m not waiting for HazMat while it breathes through—seal it, increase overpressure on our side, and keep guns trained low for anything that slips under.*

### Turn 187 [GAME]

Dock Guard #2 tightens his stance, knees bent, pistol canted down. “Copy. Low angle.” He keeps the hazard-tape arc intact, but his eyes flick to your hands as you move in—ready to fire if something breaks the line.

Dock Control answers over the open channel, voice clipped as systems obey. “Roger. No inert on your side. Station-side overpressure coming up point-two bar. Scrubbers maxed.” A half-second later: “Iris actuator power is cut. Hard-lock engaged.” You hear it through the door more than you feel it: a dull *clunk* as the mechanism deadens and stops hunting.

The pressure change is immediate in the small of your ears, like a slow squeeze. The vapor feathering out of the bottom seam thins, then reverses—now it’s being pushed *in* toward the isolated run. The “breath” effect dies.

You snatch seal tape from the nearest kit—Dock Guard #1’s belt pouch is already torn open from earlier, tape roll half-spooled. You slap it over the bottom seam. The tape adheres, but the surface beneath it is slick; the edge wants to curl until you press hard with your glove and drag it flat.

When you drive the wedge/prybar into the seam lip and crank, metal protests. The iris rib flexes a few millimeters, enough to pinch the leak line—then it catches on something rigid inside the seam.

A sharp *tink*—your wedge bites, then skates. The tool jerks, and for a split second the seam opens wider than before.

Something **threads out**: not a limb, not fluid—more like a black, hair-thin filament that whips into the gap, testing the air. Dock Guard #2 fires once, exactly where you told him—low, into the deck line.

The round sparks off the iris lip and punches into the deck plating with a flat *whap*. The filament snaps back instantly, leaving a tiny crescent of wet black on the edge of your tape. The tape bubbles where it’s touched, as if warmed from underneath.

Containment lead waves people back hard. “TEN METERS. MASKS—SEAL THEM NOW.” Two weld techs stumble over each other retreating; one slaps his own throat mic like it’s choking him, then clamps his visor ring tighter.

Threat, explicit: whatever is behind the iris can extend a thin probing filament through any momentary gap, and it reacts to air pressure; your crimp reduced the leak, but the seam is now **mechanically hung** on something inside, and your patch is degrading where it was contacted.

### Turn 188 [PLAYER]

I yank the prybar back and snarl, “No more prying—door stays shut.”

I thumb my comm. “Dock Control, that seam’s compromised and it’s probing through—route me a fire suppression canister or foam line to 3A-19, now. Also get a thermal cam on this iris from your side if you can; I want to see where it’s hot.”

I point at Guard #2. “Two-shot bursts only if it shows again—aim for the filament, not the door.” Then I grab a second strip of tape and slap it over the bubbled spot as a sacrificial layer, keeping my hands clear of the seam. “Containment lead—nobody talks, nobody panics; just keep them back and sealed until HazMat cuts this thing open on our terms.”

*Agent reasoning: That filament and bubbling tape means contact is corrosive/heat-reactive; prying risked opening the seam. I need standoff, reinforce without widening the gap, and prep to burn/kill anything that probes again while HazMat arrives.*

### Turn 189 [GAME]

You yank the prybar free. The iris lip snaps back a fraction with a metallic *ping*, but the seam doesn’t re-open—your earlier crimp and the overpressure keep it pinned tight. The bubbled patch you laid down sizzles softly for two seconds… then goes still, leaving a puckered, glossy blister the size of a thumbnail.

Dock Control comes back fast. “Copy: probing filament. Fire suppression—routing a portable AFFF canister and a foam line from Dock 9 manifold. Nearest responder is the welder lead with a canister; ETA ninety seconds.” A beat. “Thermal: I can give you station-side thermals on the iris housing through the bulkhead sensors, not a camera view. Sending overlay to your visor now.”

Your visor pings and paints a crude heat map. Most of the iris reads cold-blue. The bottom seam you patched shows a thin orange arc—localized heat, like friction or something metabolizing just beneath the metal. It isn’t spreading, but it pulses: brighten… dim… brighten, in a slow rhythm that doesn’t match any station cycle.

Guard #2 nods without taking his eyes off the seam. “Two-shot. Filament only.” He adjusts his angle so his rounds would rake *outward* into open deck, not into the door frame.

You lay down a second strip of tape over the blistered spot. It sticks, but the moment your glove pressure lifts, the outer layer dimples inward as if something on the other side briefly *sips* at it—then releases. No breakthrough, just a visible tug that leaves a shallow concavity in the tape.

Containment lead herds the crew back another ten meters, physically placing himself between them and the taped seam. “Nobody talks on open mics,” he barks. “If you feel dizzy, you signal me—hand up, no words.” He makes each person check their seals by tapping visor rims and pulling on mask straps until he’s satisfied.

From behind the iris, you hear that rasping scrape again—lower now, directly behind your patch—followed by a single, deliberate *tap* against the metal, like a knuckle testing a wall.

Threat, explicit: the thing behind the iris is concentrating at the heated bottom seam and can apply suction/pressure through micro-gaps; your sacrificial tape is buying time, but it’s being tested and deformed, and the rhythm in the thermal overlay suggests active, intentional contact rather than passive leakage.

### Turn 190 [PLAYER]

I back up to the edge of the tape arc, rifle up, and snap, “Everyone stays behind the line—no heroes.”

I key Dock Control. “Increase station-side overpressure another notch if you can without stressing bulkheads—keep that seam blowing *in* to the isolated run. And vent the isolated run down to vacuum if you’ve got remote authority; I want whatever’s in there starving.”

I point at Guard #2 and the containment lead. “You two—set a crossfire. If that filament shows, pin it with two-shot bursts and I’ll foam the seam.”

I ready my extinguisher/utility sprayer if I have one; otherwise I wait for the AFFF canister and, the moment it arrives, I blast a thick bead of foam along the bottom seam and over the tape to choke the micro-gaps and mark any movement. “HazMat’s not cutting anything until we freeze this thing in place.”

*Agent reasoning: It’s actively working the seam; I want to deny it airflow and blind-probe space with foam while we wait, and I’m not letting anyone stand close if it pops. If it wants in, it comes through a kill zone on my terms.*

### Turn 192 [PLAYER]

I fall back to the edge of the tape arc, rifle up. “Everyone stays behind the line—no heroes.”

I key Dock Control. “Bump station-side overpressure one notch if it won’t stress bulkheads—keep that seam blowing *in*. If you’ve got remote authority, vent the isolated run down toward vacuum; starve whatever’s in there.”

I point at Guard #2 and the containment lead. “Set a crossfire. Filament shows, two-shot bursts to pin it—then I foam the seam.”

If I’ve got any sprayer, I ready it; otherwise the second that AFFF canister hits my hands, I lay a thick bead of foam along the bottom seam and over the tape, watching for ripples or tunneling. “HazMat doesn’t cut until we freeze it in place.”

*Agent reasoning: The seam is being actively probed; I want to deny airflow, buy time, and set up immediate suppression if it pushes through. Overpressure and vacuuming the isolated run are blunt tools that might starve it, while crossfire + foam gives us control without opening the door.*

I shoulder my rifle at the tape-line edge. “Behind the line. No heroes.”

I key Dock Control. “Overpressure up one notch—keep it blowing *in*. And vent the isolated run toward vacuum if you’ve got remote authority; starve it.”

I jab at Guard #2 and the containment lead. “Crossfire here and here. Filament shows, two-shot bursts to pin—no door strikes.”

I grab the AFFF canister the second it arrives and lay a thick bead of foam along the entire bottom seam and over the tape, watching for ripples, tunneling, or any spot that drinks the foam. “HazMat doesn’t cut until this thing’s frozen in place.”

*Agent reasoning: The seam is actively testing the patch; I want maximum pressure advantage and to deny it atmosphere, then physically choke the micro-gaps with foam while setting disciplined fields of fire.*

### Turn 196 [PLAYER]

I snap on comms, “Dock Control—confirm: overpressure increased and isolated run venting toward vacuum. Give me live thermal on that bottom seam—any change in that pulse?”

I level my rifle at the seam and bark, “Crossfire set now. Two-shot bursts on filament only—no door strikes.” 

I grab the first foam/AFFF that arrives and smear a thick bead across the entire bottom seam and over the tape, then hold position and watch for any spot that tunnels, ripples, or “drinks” the foam.

*Agent reasoning: Nothing new is being shown—either a glitch or the scene stalled. I’m aggressive and I need actionable intel fast, so I’ll force an update: confirm Dock Control actions, get eyes on the seam/thermals, and push foam deployment while setting a firing plan.*

### Turn 197 [GAME]

Dock Control comes back a half-second late, voice pinched with strain and background alarms. “Node 3A-19, copy. Station-side overpressure bumped one notch. Bulkhead stress within green—barely. Isolated run… standby…”

A second voice cuts in—someone higher up, calmer. “Remote authority denied. That run’s tied into Dock 9’s life-support trunk. We can’t hard-vent without purging the whole finger. We *can* throttle it and lock dampers.”

Your visor pings as Dock Control pushes a thermal feed overlay. The bottom-right seam shows a thin, repeating temperature dip—like a pulse of cold—every three seconds. As the overpressure increases, the pulse doesn’t stop; it shifts. The cold dip tightens into a smaller spot, concentrating near the upper-right seam breach you already clocked, then spreads back out like it’s testing the boundary.

Guard #2 moves when you bark—boots scuffing on grit—taking a knee to your left with his rifle braced on a bollard. The containment lead—arc-hood still down, faceplate reflecting red strip lights—positions opposite, behind a portable tool cart. “Crossfire set,” the lead says, and you hear their breath rasp through a filter. “We’re not shooting unless you call it.”

The first AFFF canister gets shoved into your hands by a welder tech in nitrile gloves. You lay a thick bead along the bottom seam and over the tape.

At first, it looks good—white foam swelling, sealing the gap.

Then three things happen, clear as a checklist:

1) A narrow channel opens in the foam dead center of the seam—no spray, no airflow you can feel—just a clean tunnel as if something slid beneath it. The foam collapses inward along that line.

2) Near the upper-right seam breach, the foam *darkens* in a thumbnail-sized patch, turning gray and wet, as if it’s being dissolved from underneath. That patch “drinks” the foam faster than you can lay it down.

3) The thermal overlay spikes: the cold pulse stops being rhythmic and becomes continuous at that dissolving patch—steady, deep cold.

From inside the hatch, you get a sound like a fingernail dragged along metal—slow, deliberate—tracking along the seam under the foam.

The weld-drone above you twitches on its mag-clamps, rotates its head toward the breach, and emits a short, chirping error tone as if its proximity sensors just went blind.

### Turn 198 [PLAYER]

I snap my rifle to the upper-right breach. “There—cold spot. Guard #2, you see filament, you stitch that exact point—two shots, repeat. Lead, same.”

I key Dock Control hard. “Throttle and lock those dampers *now*. I want that run isolated as far as you can make it. And get me a clamp kit and a patch plate—mag-clamps, anything—plus HazMat on the move.”

I shove the AFFF nozzle right onto the dissolving patch and dump foam until it domes up, then I grab the nearest hard tool—spare steel plate, cart panel, anything flat—and slam it over the breach like a shield. “Tech—hold this plate with me. If it moves, you let go and get back.”

Without waiting for permission, I bark, “Welder—give me a hot tack line around the plate edge. Fast. We seal it or we shoot it.”

*Agent reasoning: The foam is getting tunneled and dissolved at the upper-right breach where the cold concentrates—it's the active point. I need to deny it the gap and stop it from expanding, even if I have to burn or clamp the area. I’ll also force Dock Control to throttle/lock dampers and bring HazMat/cutting gear now while we hold crossfire.*

I shove the AFFF nozzle into the dissolving patch and dump foam until it domes, then rip a flat panel off the tool cart and slam it over the breach. “You—hands on this with me. If it bucks, you drop and back off.”

I bark up at the weld-drone. “Hot tack around the plate edge—fast. Seal it or we start shooting.”

*Agent reasoning: The cold spot is the active breach; foam is getting eaten and something is moving under it. I need immediate isolation, physical occlusion, and a quick tack to buy time—while keeping crossfire disciplined.*

I keep my rifle trained on the upper-right breach. “Guard #2—containment lead—eyes on that exact cold patch. Filament shows, you stitch it: two-shot bursts, same point, again.”

I key Dock Control. “Lock and throttle every damper you can—now. Get me mag-clamps, a patch plate, and HazMat moving or I’m sealing it myself with scrap.”

I jam the AFFF nozzle into the dissolving spot and flood it until it domes, then yank a flat panel off the nearest cart and slam it over the breach. “Tech—help me hold this. If it bucks, you let go and get behind the line.”

I shout at the weld-drone. “Hot tack around the plate edge—fast. Seal it.”

*Agent reasoning: We can’t talk this thing down; the breach is actively dissolving foam and “feeling” along the seam. I’m forcing isolation, pinning it with fire if it shows, and mechanically sealing the spot with a plate and hot tacks before it spreads.*

### Turn 203 [GAME]

Guard #2 and the containment lead both shift their aim to the same thumbnail-sized cold patch. You see their muzzles settle, disciplined, waiting for something to *show itself*.

Dock Control answers over your open channel, rushed. “Throttling now—stand by—” A clack of relays. “Dampers 9-Finger A and C locked. B is… not responding. We can’t get full isolation from here. Pressure’s stabilizing but you’ve still got bleed-through.”

You bury the AFFF nozzle into the dissolving spot and dump. The foam swells into a dome—then the center of it *hollows* like it’s being sucked into a straw. The gray wet patch expands under the foam, eating it from below in a clean circle.

You rip a flat side panel off the tool cart—thin steel, bent at one corner—and slap it over the breach. A tech grabs the opposite edge with you, knuckles white through gloves.

For half a second it holds.

Then the panel twitches—one sharp *tap* from the other side—followed by a slow, steady push. Not a blow. A measured pressure, like someone leaning their shoulder into it and testing your grip. The AFFF trapped under the panel hisses as it compresses.

Above, the weld-drone chirps again, rotates its torch head toward the plate edge… and then pauses. Its arm jitters, as if its control loop can’t find a stable surface. It lowers the tip anyway and spits a short tack.

The tack doesn’t spark the way it should. The molten bead flashes dull, then instantly frosts over, turning grainy and white. The drone recoils and squeals a higher error tone.

At the same moment, Guard #2 barks, “Filament—there!” You see it: a hair-thin black line extrudes from the seam just beside your plate, not whipping like a wire—*feeling* along the foam, tracing toward the tech’s glove.

Guard #2 fires two tight shots into the exact point. The rounds punch the hatch face with sharp metallic cracks. The filament snaps back—gone—leaving behind two tiny holes that immediately rim with hoarfrost.

The pressure behind your panel increases. The tech grunts, boots sliding a few centimeters. “It’s pushing,” he says, voice breaking. “Mara—”

Dock Control, louder now: “Clamp kit is en route from Bay 4. HazMat’s two minutes out. Vents are holding at 1.2 over—B damper still stuck.”

The threat is now clear and physical: something cold and forceful is pressing from inside at the upper-right breach, and it can extend a thin, searching filament through any gap—fast enough to reach for exposed hands if you give it a path.

### Turn 204 [PLAYER]

“Tech—drop back behind the line. Now. I’m not losing your hand to that thing.”

I jam the panel harder into the breach and brace it with my boot and the cart frame, keeping my body behind the plate as much as I can. “Guard #2, lead—if filament shows again, same point, two-shot bursts. If it comes through the gap, you dump the seam until it stops moving.”

I key Dock Control. “B damper’s stuck? Override it—cut power, blow the actuator, I don’t care. Get it shut. Clamp kit better be sprinting.”

Without looking away from the seam, I shove my knife into the foam line like a probe to find the channel edge, then bark at the weld-drone, “Forget pretty—burn a ring on the hatch face around this patch. Give me heat, not a bead.”

*Agent reasoning: The plate won’t hold long and the filament is probing for flesh; I need hands out of reach, more standoff, and decisive violence if it breaches. Buy time until clamps arrive by bracing and creating a kill zone while ordering damper B forced shut.*

I key Dock Control. “B damper’s stuck? Override it—cut power, blow the actuator, I don’t care. Shut it. And that clamp kit better be running.”

Without taking my eyes off the seam, I stab my knife into the foam line to find the channel edge, then bark at the weld-drone, “Forget pretty—burn a hot ring on the hatch face around this patch. I want heat, not a bead.”

*Agent reasoning: The filament is reaching for exposed hands and the pressure is increasing; I need to remove the tech from danger, force isolation on the stuck damper, and create a crude heat barrier/seal fast even if it’s ugly.*

### Turn 207 [GAME]

The tech doesn’t argue. He lets go immediately and stumbles backward behind the rifle line, cradling his hands tight to his chest like he can’t trust where they’ve been. “I’m clear,” he says, breathing too fast.

You drive the panel in harder and wedge it: boot on the cart frame, shoulder tucked behind steel. The push from the other side meets you—steady pressure—then eases a fraction, like it’s reassessing the new brace.

Your knife goes into the foam at the seam. The blade meets resistance, then slips into a narrow channel that shouldn’t exist in solid AFFF—like a straw-sized void. As you probe sideways, the foam around the knife collapses inward and you feel a faint *vibration* through the handle, a low hum that wasn’t there a second ago.

Guard #2 tracks the seam. The containment lead leans into his sightline. Both are tense but controlled.

Dock Control comes back, voice clipped and strained. “We’re trying. B damper override isn’t taking—manual interlock is refusing. If we cut power it fails *open*, not shut. We can send a runner to the actuator trunk but—” a pause, someone in the background shouting, “—Clamp kit is moving. Thirty seconds.”

You snap at the weld-drone. It swivels, torch brightening. It drops to the hatch face and draws a fast ring of heat around the panel’s edge—no filler, just raw torch.

This time it *does* spark—but wrong. The metal doesn’t glow red; it flashes, then turns pale and crystalline, frosting outward from the heat line instead of receding. The ring you’re trying to burn becomes a white, brittle halo that crackles as it forms.

The pressure behind the panel surges in response—harder now, testing. The cart frame creaks. Your boot slips half an inch, catching again.

Then the filament shows—not where you shot before. It extrudes from the *new* brittle halo, a hairline crack in the frost-ring, and it comes out fast, angling low toward your knife hand like it knows exactly where the gap is.

“CONTACT!” Guard #2 fires two shots into the crack point. The rounds punch through the frosted halo, blasting shards outward. The filament jerks, whips once, and retracts—but not before it brushes the knife blade. The foam around your knife instantly thins, turning watery, and the channel widens.

You now have a compromised seam: the torch-created frost-ring is making the hatch face more brittle, and the thing inside is using those micro-cracks to “route” its filament toward any tool or hand near the gap. The panel is still holding, but the pushes are getting stronger and smarter.

### Turn 208 [PLAYER]

“Weld-drone, OFF—back the torch away!” 

I yank my knife out and fling it behind the line without looking. “No tools near the seam—keep your hands off the foam.”

I dig in harder on the panel brace and shout, “Clamp kit here, on my call—two mags ready. Guard #2, lead: filament shows anywhere, you rake the frost-ring, don’t get cute.”

I key Dock Control. “Send that runner to the B actuator trunk NOW. I want it physically shut—jam it, wedge it, whatever. And tell HazMat to bring cold-resistant wraps and a fucking saw if they’ve got it.”

*Agent reasoning: Heat is making it worse and it’s targeting my hands through cracks; I need to stop the weld-drone, keep the panel braced, and switch to mechanical clamps while ordering someone to hit the actuator trunk to shut the damper.*

### Turn 209 [GAME]

The weld-drone chirps an annoyed, descending tone and backs its torch away. The bright cone shutters off, leaving only the hatch’s emergency strips and the pale frost-halo it already laid down—now a brittle ring of micro-cracks around your plate.

Your knife comes free with a wet suction-pop. You fling it behind the line; it skitters across the deck and stops against a boot. Someone yelps and kicks it farther away without thinking.

“No tools near the seam!” you bark, and the nearest Helix techs flatten their hands up and back like they’ve been caught stealing.

You dig in on the brace. The cart frame groans again, but holds.

“Clamp kit!” A welder tech in an arc hood and a station rigger sprint in with a hardcase and a ratcheting band clamp—industrial, meant for hull patching. They drop to a knee just outside your immediate line, waiting for your call, eyes locked on the frost-ring like it might blink.

Guard #2 and the containment lead shift their stance wider. “Copy,” Guard #2 says. He changes his aim point from the original crack to the *entire* frosted halo.

Dock Control crackles back. “Runner dispatched. Two minutes to actuator trunk. HazMat is staging wraps—saw request acknowledged.”

Then the hatch face *ticks*—a sharp, glassy sound. A new hairline crack races along the frost-ring on the lower right.

A filament extrudes from it immediately, thicker than before—more like a black thread than a hair—and it doesn’t reach for hands this time. It lays itself flat against the hatch face and starts sliding along the frost-ring, probing for an edge, searching for a route under your plate.

“FILAMENT!” Guard #2 rakes the halo with a short burst—three, four shots. The frosted ring shatters in little white chips, and the filament snaps back, but you feel the pressure behind the plate *shift* sideways in the same instant, like it learned where you’re weakest.

Your brace jerks. The cart wheels squeal and slide a few centimeters. The panel edge lifts a fraction—just enough for a breath of gray vapor to puff out and instantly rim the gap with fresh frost.

The immediate threat is escalating: the brittle frost-ring is propagating cracks that the filament can use anywhere around the plate, and the force behind the breach is now testing lateral movement to pry up an edge. Your improvised brace is starting to slip.
