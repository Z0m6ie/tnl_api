      "content": "Morning, Saltmarrow Cemetery’s upper tier—Lantern Row—where the path narrows between leaning slate and a low iron fence furred with salt. Sea-mist beads on carved names until they look freshly inked. The lanterns are still lit from last night, and each flame sputters an unhealthy blue that makes the gravel look cold.\n\nYou kneel beside the Harrowell marker, apron tied, hair pinned back the way you learned above Ashford & Daughters. A soft brush clears lichen from a serifed “E,” and your small tools click in your pocket when you shift your weight. You test the stone with a fingertip, careful as if it were skin, then set a stencil to match the original cut. Patience is part of the job; so is noticing what other people hope you won’t.\n\nThe date is wrong.\n\nYesterday the stone read *1889*. Today it reads *1883*, the new “3” cut too clean to be weather. At the base, fresh grit still sits in the chisel line. You lean closer and find a second problem: the border stones around the Harrowell plot have been nudged inward, just enough that the corner now bites into the neighboring family’s ground. That kind of shift takes time, leverage, and permission—unless someone is doing it before dawn.\n\nFootsteps crunch behind you. When you turn, a man stands just inside the gate, coat damp at the shoulders, dark hair still threaded with mist. He doesn’t carry a tour pamphlet or a wreath. He holds a folded sheet of vellum in one hand and keeps the other near his pocket like he’s used to trouble. “Elowen Ashford,” he says, not asking. He opens the vellum just enough for you to see a maintenance overlay of the cemetery—ghost paths, sealed sections—and three plot coordinates inked in your mother’s looping shorthand.\n\n“I bought this from someone who shouldn’t have it,” he says. “Your name was the only instruction.”\n\nThe blue lantern above you gutters hard, as if reacting.\n\nYou have a freshly altered grave at your knees, an impossible map in a stranger’s hand, and a town heading toward the Brine-Choir’s vigil tonight. He waits for an answer, and the cemetery stays very still.",

The ink is old-black, not the newer soot-brown the Society uses—your mother’s habit of tightening the downstrokes is there, unmistakable. The stranger doesn’t pull it away, but his grip firms at the corners.\n\nHe answers your questions in the wrong order.\n\n“Because the cemetery is being run like a ledger,” he says, low. “And ledgers have overlays.”\n\nThen: “A lantern-lighter sold it to me. Not one of the public-facing guides—one of the ones who carries keys.” His eyes flick past your shoulder, toward the path behind you, as if expecting someone to be listening. “He didn’t give a name. He had a thumb missing to the first knuckle and smelled like lamp-oil and brine. He said the map was ‘hot’ and that if I wanted the rest of it, I should find you before the Choir started singing tonight.”\n\nAs he speaks, a faint click comes from the iron fence to your left—metal on metal, like a latch being tested. You look: nothing obvious moves, but the chain on the side gate is hanging differently than you remember, the padlock turned outward instead of inward.\n\nThe blue lantern above you sputters again. In that brief stutter, you catch it: a second set of footprints in the damp gravel off the main path—too narrow for the caretaker’s boots you know, toes pointed toward you and the stranger, then scuffed as if someone backed away into the grass.\n\nThe man folds the vellum once, not hiding it fully but making it easier to snatch. “If you want to ask me what I’m doing in Saltmarrow,” he adds, “do it somewhere that isn’t lit like a signal.”\n\nAnother sound—soft, deliberate—comes from the row of headstones behind the Harrowell plot: the scrape of grit under a shoe sole.

The stone there holds the night’s chill; the blue lanternlight doesn’t reach cleanly, and the mist seems to hesitate at the carved angels over the door.\n\nHe obeys immediately. The vellum folds in practiced, quick creases and disappears into the inner pocket of his coat. He shifts so his body blocks the mausoleum door seam, eyes fixed on the row of headstones you called out to.\n\nYour voice carries. “Cemetery’s closed…”\n\nFor a beat, nothing answers—only the buoy-bell’s distant moan and the lantern’s wet sputter.\n\nThen someone steps into view between two slates: a Lanternward man in a dark oilskin, lantern-hook belt at his waist. His left hand is wrapped in stained cloth, thumb stump blunt beneath it. He holds a long-handled lantern snuffer like a walking stick, and his face is drawn tight with sleeplessness.\n\nHe stops where the path widens, keeping a respectful distance that still feels like a boundary. “No need to shout, Miss Ashford,” he says, voice mild and rehearsed. “Caretaker sent me to check the blue lamps. Folks have been… fretting.”\n\nBehind him, a second figure doesn’t step out—only a suggestion of movement in the grass line to his right, where the mist thickens. You hear a quiet exhale and the faint clink of something metal being adjusted, like a buckle or a keyring.\n\nThe Lanternward man’s gaze flicks to the Harrowell stone at your knees—wrong date, nudged borders—and then to the stranger’s coat pocket, too quickly to be accidental. “You’ve got company,” he notes, as if it’s casual. “Not a tour day.”\n\nThe stranger beside you goes still. His hand stays visible, empty, but his posture changes—ready.\n\nThe Lanternward man lifts his snuffer a few inches, not threatening exactly, but making it clear he can close lanterns—make dark—fast. “If you’ve found something you shouldn’t,” he says, softer now, “best you hand it over. The Society doesn’t like… misunderstandings. Especially before a vigil.”\n\nHe doesn’t advance. He waits, and the hidden presence in the grass waits with him.",

For a moment he looks like he might ignore it—then he answers, as if forced by habit into politeness.\n\n“Pell,” he says. “Jory Pell.”\n\nHe does not lower the snuffer. Instead, he plants its ferrule on the gravel and leans on it, casual as a cane. “Daylight, office, proper records,” he repeats, tasting the words. “That’s the trouble with you Ashfords. You think paper keeps you safe.”\n\nAt the mention of the Harrowell date, his eyes cut to the stone again. He doesn’t deny it changed. That silence is its own admission.\n\nFrom the grass line to Pell’s right, the hidden figure finally commits: a woman steps half out of the mist, not Lanternward-uniformed—plain dark dress, hair pinned tight, a ring of keys on a chain at her waist. She doesn’t look at you first; she looks at the stranger, then at Pell, and gives the smallest nod, like confirming a description.\n\nPell speaks again, voice still mild, but the edges are sharper. “You can keep your voice down and we can all walk away tidy. Or you can shout for a caretaker who isn’t on this tier, and my friend here—Mara—will make sure your shouting doesn’t carry.”\n\nMara’s hand comes up. Not a weapon—an oiled cloth and a small glass bottle. The smell hits even from a few paces: sharp, sweet, medicinal. Ether or something like it.\n\nThe threat is clear now: they’re not here to argue policy. They’re here to take the map and, if necessary, quiet you.\n\nPell shifts his weight forward one step, closing distance. “Last chance,” he says, eyes on the stranger’s coat pocket. “Hand it over.”\n\nThe blue lantern above you gutters hard, and for a second the path is darker—enough for Mara to angle her body as if preparing to rush from the grass.",

He doesn’t argue—he bolts, coat tails snapping, heading down Lantern Row exactly as you ordered.\n\nMara moves immediately. She lunges after him, keys clinking, bottle and cloth up like she’s done this before. Pell barks, “Not the girl—get the map!” and surges forward toward you instead, trying to cut you off from following.\n\nYou shout—full-throated, tearing sound that bounces off slate and marble: “CARETAKER—UPPER TIER!

But it’s not close.\n\nPell closes the distance fast. He swings the snuffer not at your head, but low, aiming to hook your ankle or knock your legs out from under you.

His face goes mean with embarrassment. “Shut—up,” he spits, and swings the snuffer again, higher now, aiming to clip your shoulder and drive you back into the mausoleum’s shadow.

He staggers sideways, one hand cupped between his legs, the other held up and bleeding, eyes watering with rage.\n\n“DON’T TOUCH ME,” you snarl through the cloth.\n\nYou scream again, voice tearing: “LANTERN ROW—SHE’S GOT ETHER!”\n\nThat word changes the air. Down the slope, the running footsteps you heard speed up—two sets now—and someone shouts back, “ETHER? WHO—?”\n\nMara hears it too. She’s at the pinch-point just as the stranger reaches it. She darts in from the side, cloth snapping up toward his face.\n\nBut your shout and your next call hit in the same instant: “LEFT—OFF THE ROW, THROUGH THE YEW BREAK!”\n\nThe stranger commits on instinct. He veers left, shoulder-checking into the yew’s dark gap instead of pushing through the narrow stones. Mara’s cloth brushes his cheek—not a full seal—and he stumbles into the branches, coughing, but he’s still moving.\n\nMara swears, sharp and low, and plunges after him. The yew boughs whip and scrape; her keys jangle wildly, giving away her line.\n\nBehind you, Pell isn’t finished. He straightens with a hiss, face blotched with pain and humiliation. He snatches up the snuffer again and—rather than swing—he lunges to tackle, trying to drive you to the ground and stop you from shouting any more.\n\nYou have a heartbeat of warning: his boots scrape on gravel, shoulders dropping as he comes in.\n\nDown Lantern Row, lanternlight flares—two figures cresting the rise, still a short run away. They’re close enough now that Pell glances toward them, calculating whether to finish this fast or flee.\n\n**Threats now:** Pell is mid-lunge to take you down; Mara is in pursuit through the yew break, and the stranger is not yet safe—he’s being chased in close quarters where a cloth can be clamped over his face.",

His lips part as if to speak, but only a hoarse whisper comes out: “Map… not… theirs…”\n\nThe broad Lanternward, still crouched, finally unfolds the paper one careful crease at a time.\n\nIt’s a maintenance overlay—thin vellum, inked with plot lines and narrow dotted routes that don’t match any public cemetery map. In the margin: three looping letters in an old shorthand—familiar enough to make your stomach dip, even at a glance.\n\nThe lantern beside you flares a brighter, attentive blue for a heartbeat, throwing everyone’s shadows long and sharp across the mausoleum face—your profile clear as a cutout.\n\nAnd from the path below, a voice calls out with practiced cheer, closing in through the fog: “Oh! There you all are—what a *busy* little scene. Are we having an after-hours tour?”\n\nA Lanternward tour-guide is drifting up the gravel walk, smile already in place, eyes aimed like hooks at your hands and tools and stance over Pell. The threat is immediate and social as much as physical: someone official is arriving to control the story.",

She’s in a neat coat with a silver lantern pin; her hair is pinned back so tightly it looks painful. Her smile doesn’t reach her eyes.\n\n“A medic,” she repeats, as if tasting the word. “Of course.

Instead she looks past you to the broad Lanternward and the vellum. “Steward Halden—what is that in your hand?”\n\nHalden (broad Lanternward) hesitates a fraction at your “bag it” order—then chooses speed over argument.

Now.”\n\nHalden hears your order and makes a quick decision in the mausoleum’s shadow. He pulls a small oilskin evidence pouch from his belt—creased, used—and, keeping his glove on, transfers the folded vellum from his coat pocket into the pouch without fully exposing it again. He rolls the top, ties it off, and then—importantly—doesn’t keep it. He sets it on the mausoleum’s stone ledge behind his boot, out of the guide’s direct line of sight but not in anyone’s hands.\n\nThe guide notices the movement anyway. Her chin lifts. “What did you just bag?”\n\n“Found property,” Halden answers, too neutral. He doesn’t offer it.\n\nTolan obeys immediately: he shoves Pell’s cheek into the grass and shifts his knee higher across Pell’s shoulder blades, forcing Pell’s face away from the yews. Pell snarls something muffled and tries to crane his neck; Tolan yanks his wrists up hard enough that Pell grunts and stops trying.\n\nFrom the yews, the signaling changes. You hear two quick clicks—closer than before—followed by a soft scuff of shoes on damp leaves. Someone is moving, using the cover. The threat is no longer abstract: there is at least one unseen person repositioning in the trees within a few yards.\n\nThe guide’s thumb tightens on the whistle. “If someone’s in those yews,” she says, voice clipped, “we call lanterns.

The sound is bright and cutting.\n\nA heartbeat later, somewhere below the tier, you hear it answered: one whistle back, farther off, and the faint clatter of a lantern pole against stone as someone starts moving.\n\nHalden moves on your instruction, but he doesn’t do it gently. He hooks his arms under the slumped stranger’s shoulders and drags him onto the path, boots scraping gravel. The stranger’s head lolls; he coughs wetly and tries to speak, failing.

To lanterns?” A pause. “You think they don’t already know the words?”\n\nA figure doesn’t step out.

Keeps you… *compliant*.”\n\nTheir gloved hand flexes, grinding shards into the gravel.\n\nImmediate threats are now:\n- the first vial’s irritant plume is increasing again because its cover was shifted,\n- the left yew attacker is still engaged and trying to free/drag that vial with the hook-pole,\n- the broken ampoule’s low vapor continues to spread along the ground where the pinned attacker fell—less dangerous uphill, but it’s contaminating the area around the Lanternward holding them.",

They stop trying to “win” the hook-pole and instead *kill the angle*: they slam their own pole down across it and put a boot on the shaft, grinding it against the headstone corner until the yew-side attacker loses purchase.\n\nThere’s a sharp crack—wood under strain—and the hook-pole end *splinters*. The yew-side attacker jerks back, suddenly holding a shortened, broken length.\n\nA second later, a figure bolts from the yews—not toward you, but sideways, using the brush as cover.

The venting drops from a sharp “bite” to a thinner seep.\n\nYou’ve reduced the immediate spread, but you’ve also made a messy, contaminated patch of gravel that will keep irritating anyone who steps into it.\n\nBehind you, the pinned attacker flinches at your questions, then goes still. Their eyes flick—not to your face, but to the lantern-glass, catching their own reflection for a heartbeat as if checking what it reveals.\n\nA voice answers from the path behind the mausoleum, bright with too-perfect politeness: “Oh—goodness.

She looks from the casualty being hauled uphill to the grit-smeared vial patch, and then to you.\n\nThe pinned attacker’s gaze snaps to her and shuts like a door.\n\nUnder the Lanternward’s pole, the attacker rasps, “No one *sent* me.”\n\nThen, after a pause that’s almost a dare: “Ask the Choir where they keep their ‘blessings.’”\n\nThe tide-singer’s smile doesn’t move, but her eyes do—down to the ground, to the vapor hugging the gravel, measuring distance like she’s counting steps.",

For two heartbeats the air feels tight, as if the cemetery is holding it.\n\nA pale moth—thumbprint-sized, almost colorless—lifts from the nearest lantern-glass where it had been still as a fleck of ash. It flutters in a small, deliberate spiral, then darts away upslope toward the Lanternward office roofs, as if carrying the sound with it.\n\nThe Lanternward you beckon do exactly what you say: two fall in on Jory, each taking an elbow and keeping their own faces turned upwind. One of them—older, with a split thumbnail—keeps repeating, “Feet still. Eyes on me,” like a charm. The rest bunch with you toward the north lantern-shed, scarves up, mouths shut.\n\nJory answers your murmur without moving their feet, voice strained. “Yes. Like surf in a shell—only it’s… backwards. Like it’s pulling the sound *in*.”\n\nYou make it another dozen paces uphill when a figure steps out from between two leaning marbles ahead—close enough that they must have been waiting just off the path.\n\nA Brine-Choir “volunteer,” by the sash and the neat hymn-book tucked under one arm. Their scarf is white, their smile practiced, and their eyes go straight to you.\n\n“Wren Ashford,” they say softly, as if greeting you at a service. “I heard you were asking after your mother. The sea keeps excellent records, dear. Better than stone.”\n\nThey angle their body to block the cleanest line toward the north lantern-shed without looking like they’re blocking anything at all.\n\nBehind you, from a side tier, a Lanternward caretaker in a dark apron appears and begins drifting parallel to your group—close enough to listen, far enough to claim coincidence—hand already on a ring of keys.\n\nThe threat is clear now: the name you drew out has sent an alert through the lantern network. The Choir has arrived to “help” on their terms, and Lanternward attention is closing in just as you try to reach the shed.",

He looks past you to the volunteer first, then to the two Lanternward bracing Jory. His jaw works once. Still, he peels off from the parallel drift and strides upslope, keys already in hand.\n\n“North shed’s sealed for relamping,” he says, loud enough to be a rule rather than an answer. Then, lower, to you as he passes: “If you’re forcing it, you’re owning it.”\n\nHe reaches the north lantern-shed: a squat timber box with a copper vent cap and a door banded in iron. The key ring clinks. He tries the first key—wrong. Second—wrong. Third—**it turns**, but not cleanly. Something inside the lock resists like grit.\n\nHe puts his shoulder in, and the door opens a handspan with a wet-sounding sigh, as if the hinge has been recently oiled with something thicker than oil. A ribbon of cold, blue light leaks out at ankle height.\n\nThe Brine-Choir volunteer doesn’t answer your question directly. They smile wider, and their thumb strokes the hymn-book’s spine—one, two, three—like counting.\n\n“Brine-tithe isn’t *payment*,” they say. “It’s **due**. And names aren’t erased, Wren. They’re… *moved to where they belong.*”\n\nThey tilt their chin toward the shed. “You should be careful what you open. The Lanternward hates a mess.”\n\nAt your glance, Jory blinks once—hard—then a second time, slower. The two Lanternward holding them tighten their grip automatically. Jory’s throat works as if swallowing water that isn’t there, but they keep their lips sealed.\n\nThen the lanterns along your tier gutter in sequence—left to right—blue flames bowing as if in a wind that only they can feel. The “pull” hits the group as a physical tug: not enough to drag feet, but enough to make balance go wrong. Gravel skitters under boots.\n\nFrom inside the shed comes a clear, small sound: **a tool laid carefully on wood**.\n\nThe caretaker freezes with the door half-open, keys still in his fist. “Someone’s in there,” he says, voice gone flat. “And they weren’t supposed to be.”",

It steadies them, but not cleanly—two of them stagger anyway when the lanterns gutter again, and their boots scrape half-moons in the gravel.\n\nYou call into the crack of blue light.\n\nFor a beat, nothing.\n\nThen a shape shifts inside—just beyond the threshold—blocking the spill of light. A voice answers from low height, as if the speaker is crouched.\n\n“Don’t—” it says, and the word catches like a hook in the throat. “Don’t close it.”\n\nA hand appears first, palm out, fingers stained dark as if with ink or old varnish. Then the other. Slow, careful.

A margin. A footnote that can be folded shut.”\n\nThey lift their hymn-book slightly, showing its damp-swollen pages. On the inside cover—pressed into the paper like a watermark—three looping letters in your mother’s shorthand.\n\n“Ask your family’s annex,” the volunteer adds. “Ask what they keep when grief won’t stay buried.”\n\nInside the shed, the hidden person’s hands tremble.

The iron braid on the nearest path-lantern (third on the left past the rosemary offerings) answers with a faint, tight *click* from inside its housing, like a latch engaging.\n\nThe threat becomes concrete: the ward-lantern has “woken.” If anyone lunges or grabs at the bracket/sigil area, it will react—fast—like a guard-dog made of light and iron.\n\nInside the shed, the crouched figure flinches at that click.

Both hands.”\n\nBehind her, farther down the path, a bell answers—distant, single-toned, not the buoy-bell’s moan but a crisp cemetery bell. It rings once, then again, as if acknowledging a report being received.\n\nInside the shed, Lio’s eyes go wide when they see the soot on your hands.\n\n“I— I didn’t—” they whisper urgently. “The line— Iris—” Their gaze darts to the lantern, then back to you. “Upper tier, north seam. Line *Geth—*” The rest catches in their throat, like something presses on the word.\n\nThe threat is immediate and physical: your marked hands make you identifiable in lanternlight, and the answering bell suggests Lanternward attention is already being summoned up-tier.",

Don’t step toward the blue.”\n\nBeside him, a woman in a neat oilskin apron lifts a small slate and a stub of chalk. She doesn’t write yet; she watches your soot-marked hands with an appraiser’s stillness. “Tagged,” she repeats, flat. “That’s a claim.”\n\nYour whisper gets through the crack. Lio obeys: you hear a quick shuffle back from the threshold, then both their hands rise into the narrow opening—palms forward, empty, fingers trembling. They match your breathing for two counts, then lose it, then find it again.\n\nThe caretaker, still linked to you by the line, does exactly what you told him. He keeps his sleeve pressed over the chalk-salt scrawl like a bandage. Sweat beads at his hairline.\n\nWhen the Lanternward pair come two steps closer—close enough that you can smell lamp-oil and wet wool—the caretaker speaks, voice hoarse but steady. “On Miss Ashford’s instruction. I covered it. No rubbing. No changes.”\n\nThe woman with the slate finally marks something down. The chalk makes a small, sharp sound. “Noted.”\n\nThen she angles her lantern-hook so its light skims the shed door and your hands. The soot-tag doesn’t smear or flake; it sits in the skin’s creases like it’s been *stamped*. Her eyes flick from your knuckles to the shed crack.\n\n“Lio Marr,” she says, as if she’s been expecting the name. “Step out. Slowly. Keep your hands up.”\n\nInside, Lio’s breath catches. They don’t move yet.\n\nDown-tier, the lamp-tender you spotted earlier lowers her palms—just a fraction—then raises them again, like she’s signaling patience. She stays put, but her head tilts as if listening for something beyond the bell and boots.\n\nThe threat is immediate and specific: Lanternward is taking control of the scene, Lio is being ordered to emerge, and your soot-mark is being treated as evidence.

Their wrists shake hard enough their fingers flutter, but they don’t drop them. When their face clears the crack, you see salt-stiff hair plastered to their forehead and a thin line of dried blood at one nostril.\n\nThe ward-lantern reacts to your voice the way you suspected: the blue sputter sharpens when the Lanternward woman shifts her hook-lantern, then eases when you speak again. The moth-shadow spiral tightens toward Lio for a heartbeat—then loosens, circling wider, as if it’s listening for the next syllable.\n\nThe woman with the slate stops advancing. She lifts her free hand, palm out, holding her partner back. “No rush,” she says, clipped. “Ashford’s right about the snap.”\n\nHer partner—badge and hook—keeps his lantern steady and raises his voice toward Lio. “Stop where you are. Good. Don’t stand. Don’t touch the doorframe.”\n\nLio stops in the light, still on their knees. They swallow and speak, voice breaking. “I didn’t— I didn’t change anything.

Not toward you—sideways, along the lower path, keeping distance from the ward’s spill. She walks with careful, practiced steps and calls up without looking directly at the blue lantern: “Supervisor Harker. You’ll want the ledger-page too, not just the hands.”\n\nThe man with the badge glances toward her, and you catch his name in the exchange—Harker, as she said. His jaw tightens. “Stay where you are, Nessa.”\n\nNessa doesn’t stop. She reaches a post and unhooks a small tin rattle-lantern—an auxiliary light—and begins to climb the side steps, keeping it low.\n\nConcrete threat: Nessa is approaching with another lantern and a “ledger-page” angle, and the ward-lantern is already showing it can snap toward the nearest moving hands if the light pattern or voices change abruptly.

Not the annex overlay. The public one.” It’s an order meant to sound routine.\n\nNessa, still frozen on the stair, calls up quietly, “Supervisor, the public map won’t show the seam breaks.”\n\nHarker doesn’t look at her. “It will show what it’s *supposed* to show.”\n\nConcrete threat: Harker is already steering this toward an “official” version of events.

She speaks as she writes, making it audible. “Recorded verbatim: ‘Lio Marr stated, Line Getherin, upper tier north seam,’ and ‘stated the Iris plot was moved to an inside row.’” She underlines *verbatim* with a hard chalk stroke, then pauses, eyes on Harker as if daring him to contradict the page.\n\nHarker’s jaw works. “That line doesn’t ‘answer mouths,’ Ashford,” he says, controlled. “People repeat what they hear.”\n\nThen you press Nessa.\n\nNessa inhales on the stair.

The singed smell lessens. Jory’s trembling doesn’t stop, but the panic in it eases into something he can hold.\n\n“Good,” Harker says under his breath—more to the situation than to you. He keeps his hook-lantern fixed, but he angles it slightly away from Jory’s forearm, reducing the blue’s direct attention.\n\nJory swallows and nods once, fast. “I’m—holding,” he manages, voice thin.\n\nThe Lanternward woman with the slate speaks as she writes again, crisp and audible. “Recorded: ‘Lio Marr said, It’s the same hand.’” Her chalk pauses at the end of the sentence, then continues—she’s adding more than you asked, the scratch of it quickening as if she doesn’t want to forget what she saw.\n\nAt your question about shorthand, Harker’s posture tightens. He doesn’t answer right away.\n\nThen: “I recognize *funeral notation*,” he says carefully, each word measured. “I don’t recognize it belonging here.”\n\nIt’s not denial. It’s a boundary being drawn.\n\nBehind the linen, the mark gives one last faint pulse—like a heartbeat muffled under cloth—and then holds steady.\n\nYour quiet warning toward the shed seam is met with a physical response: the door stops shuddering, but the latch gives a small, deliberate *tick* from the inside, as if something tested it and decided against. A thin line of colder air slips out through the seam and brushes your fingers—brine-cold, with the metallic tang of buoy-bells.\n\nLio’s eyes flick to the seam despite themselves. Their hands stay up. “It hears voices,” they whisper. “Not names. Voices.”\n\nNessa, still on the stair, doesn’t move, but she watches Harker now instead of the lantern. “Supervisor,” she says, low, “that cloth won’t hold if he sweats through it.”\n\nConcrete threat: the scrawl is contained but not neutralized—if the linen shifts, gets damp, or is pulled off, it may flare again and provoke the ward-lantern or the shed latch. The shed is still “responsive”; it has tested the latch from inside and vented cold air, suggesting something within is awake and listening for cues.",

He keeps his forearm held out like it’s someone else’s.\n\nThe slate-woman writes as you speak. “Noted: ‘Latch ticked from inside when the mark pulsed.’” Then she adds, almost reluctantly, “Observed: cold air exhaled from seam.” She says *observed* like a shield.\n\nYou keep your hand hovering near the linen.

Their throat works once. “Yours,” they answer. “It… leaned toward you when you spoke like you meant it. When I talked, it listened—when you talked, it *moved*.”\n\nHarker’s gaze flicks to you at that, sharp and assessing, then back to the covered mark. “So it’s keyed to authority,” he mutters, half to himself.\n\nThe shed responds to the conversation in a way you can’t mistake: a slow pressure against the door from the inside—just enough to bow the wood a fraction at the seam—then release. Dust puffs from the hinge line. The latch does not open, but the *tick* repeats, closer in time to your voice than before.\n\nImmediate, concrete threat: the shed is actively reacting to speech cadence and “command” tone; each time it tests the latch, the door flexes and sheds dust. If it finds the right cue—or if the mark is uncovered again—it may open, or something inside may force the seam. Also, Jory is starting to sweat; if moisture seeps into the linen, the containment may fail.\n\nTamsin has not returned yet. You have a brief window where the mark is stable but vulnerable.",

The oilcloth under your hovering palm continues to radiate that hard, kettle-heat; you can feel it even without touching.\n\nAt the door, there’s a pause—an inhale you can hear through the crack.\n\nThen the voice answers, closer now, as if they’ve leaned their mouth to the gap. “Merrick,” they say. “And that’s not a *thing*. That’s a debt I dragged in so it wouldn’t find you first.”\n\nAs Merrick speaks, the wet dragging sound shifts. Something presses into the threshold from the outside, low and unseen—followed by a soft, sucking scrape like kelp pulled off stone. The smell of seaweed rot strengthens sharply.\n\nHarker moves when you signal. He plants his shoulder and forearm against the doorframe from inside, bracing the jamb rather than the door itself, feet spread for leverage. He keeps his hands open as promised, but his stance is now a physical barrier.\n\nTamsin drops her weight low and drives her shoulder into the door near the latch instead of fumbling the bolt. The door gives a protesting groan and swings a hair wider under the outside pressure—then stops as Harker’s brace catches the frame. The gap holds at only a few inches, but it’s enough for you to see more.\n\nIn the sliver: Merrick’s face—young enough to still have softness at the mouth, old enough to have learned not to show it. Sea-mist beads in his lashes. His fingertips are stained a dark, briny black like old ink. He keeps his hands visible, empty, but he’s leaning his hip into the door as leverage.\n\nAnd at his feet, half in the gap now, is what made the dragging sound: a sodden bundle of netting and kelp tied around something that moves in small, wrong pulses. A human forearm—bloated and pale—protrudes from the net, the skin stippled as if pickled. The hand at the end twitches, not like a living person waking, but like a reflex tugged by a current.\n\nMerrick’s eyes flick from the bundled arm to you. “If you open this,” he says quietly, “it comes in. If you don’t… it keeps knocking until it learns the shape of your door.”\n\nJory squeezes your hand once, hard—still not moving his arm—his breath turning thin with fear at the sight in the gap.",

It resists like it’s snagged on the sill. For one second the pale hand in the net curls, fingers scraping the threshold wood—contact, brief and ugly.\n\nThe bundle jerks as if yanked by an invisible tide. It thumps back into the mud outside with a wet slap.\n\nThe immediate consequence: the door pressure eases. Harker’s brace suddenly has nothing to fight and he stumbles half a step, catching himself against the frame. The gap narrows a fraction as the door swings back toward closed under its own weight, leaving only Merrick’s face and shoulder visible.\n\nMerrick keeps his hands up, empty. His voice drops. “It wants what was taken off it. A name. A right burial. A place in the book.” His eyes flick, involuntarily, toward the cemetery hill beyond the yard as if he can see it through the boards. “I didn’t *make* it follow. I opened something I shouldn’t—down by the tide steps. I thought it was a Choir-marked cache. It wasn’t. It was… a return.”\n\nThe kelp bundle outside shifts again, dragging a shallow groove in the mud toward the door on its own, slow but determined—like a hooked fish being reeled with no line in sight. The pale hand bumps the bottom of the door once. A soft knock. Then another, slightly higher.\n\nMerrick swears under his breath. He looks at your feet, not your face, and does exactly as instructed: he hooks his heel behind something outside and nudges a length of rope forward. A clean, pale line slides into the shed across the threshold, inch by inch. No hands. The rope is damp but not slimy—fresh hemp, not net.\n\nTamsin shifts to block the rope with her boot so it doesn’t snake too far in. Nessa stays frozen, eyes fixed on the moving bundle outside like she’s watching a drowned body try to sit up.\n\nThreat, clear and present: the kelp-net “debt” is still trying to make contact with the door and is moving on its own toward the threshold again, despite Merrick backing it away.

A drip.\n\n“I took a name,” Merrick goes on, hoarse now. “Not mine. I thought it was just a *word* you carry to keep the sea from choosing you. That’s what the Choir said. ‘Borrow it till the next moon.’”\n\nHe draws a breath that shudders.\n\n“It was your mother’s shorthand on the stone. Three loops.

Like wet sand in a stocking.”\n\nUnder the oilcloth, that wrong pulse at his shin answers with a slow thump-thump, as if whatever’s wrapped there heard it had been noticed.\n\nAt the door, you feel the seam vibrate faintly when Merrick shifts his weight on the other side. He takes your warning; when he speaks again, he avoids the name like it’s a hook.\n\n“The mark—three loops—was on a small slate,” he says, voice tight. “Not a headstone. A boundary slate. Half-buried at the tide steps’ top landing, left side as you face down to the water. Loops cut shallow, like someone didn’t want it seen unless you knew to look.”\n\nA pause. A swallow.

When he reaches the hinge side, his hand hesitates.\n\nThere, just under the lowest hinge, the rust-bloom isn’t random: a brine-bell motif scratched into the metal, neat as a signature. Beside it, three pinprick holes in a tight triangle—placed to whistle when the wind hits.\n\nHarker’s eyes flick to yours. “Wren,” he says softly, “this door’s been used to signal.”\n\nOutside, close to the seam, the thread-tightening sound comes again—followed by a faint, eager inhale that isn’t Merrick’s.\n\nThen a voice that *tries* to be Merrick’s speaks through the wood, too smooth, wrong at the edges:\n\n“Open.

His eyes stay on yours like you’re a nail holding him to the room.\n\nHarker moves immediately. He drags the salt crock to the door, crouches, and shoves salt into the keyhole with the blunt end of a spoon—packing it until it mounds and spills. The scratching outside pauses the moment the salt hits metal, then resumes higher, closer to the latch.\n\n“Wax,” Harker mutters. He glances toward the stove and snatches a stubby candle from the mantle. He lights it off the low flame, lets it drip, and smears hot wax over the salted keyhole and along the seam where the lock plate meets the door. The wax hisses faintly as it cools.\n\nOutside, the nail (or whatever is doing the work) scrapes once—hard—right over the lock area. The door shudders. A thin line of wax fractures, but holds. Then the sound changes: not scratching now, but a careful *pressing* along the edge, as if something flat is being slid into the seam to feel for weakness.\n\nTamsin nods and darts away from the kitchen, skirts gathered in both hands. You hear cupboards open, a hurried rummage, then her voice from the back hall: “Cellar’s through the pantry—there’s a hatch!”\n\nA beat later: “Window’s painted shut—won’t budge!”\n\nShe returns with a rigid length of wood—a broken chair slat, still attached to a crosspiece like a crude brace—and a strip of twine. “This was all I could find,” she says, breathless, holding it out.\n\nJory flinches as the pressure at the door increases—he’s listening as much as you are. You lean close and give your instruction.\n\nHe swallows, then whispers through the linen, urgent and hoarse: “I— I don’t hear ticking. But… I feel it. Like… like a finger tapping from inside the bone.”\n\nAt the same moment, the salted wrap behind his knee darkens in one spot—damp spreading through the fabric from within, not from the outside. The salt there begins to clump and sag.\n\nAt the door, the seam gives a hair’s breadth with a soft *click*—not open, but loosened. Whatever is outside has found something to worry at.\n\nYou have two immediate, concrete problems:\n1) The thing in Jory is wetting the wrap from the inside and may be dissolving its own salt barrier at the back of the knee.\n2) The door’s lock seam has shifted; the outside presence is actively working the gap and is closer to forcing entry than it was seconds ago.",

It cakes fast—wet to paste to crust—until it’s a hard, gritty scab over the linen. For a breath, the seepage stops.\n\nThen the crust *ticks* once. Not a sound in the room—more like a tiny movement you feel through your fingertips. Jory goes still as if you’ve pinned a live wire. “It’s… mad,” he whispers. “Like it’s testing.”\n\nHarker doesn’t argue. He lunges for the sideboard by the wall and heaves it—wood screeching over the floorboards—into a slam against the door. He shoves the kitchen table in behind it, wedging the legs so the whole stack braces at an angle.\n\nThe outside pressure answers immediately. The door bows inward a fraction and the wax along the lock seam cracks in a jagged line. Something thin scrapes along the gap—metal on wood—trying to find purchase. The braced furniture holds, but you hear the latch plate *creak* under strain.\n\n“Pantry!” Harker snaps, already moving.\n\nTamsin leads hard, shoulder under Jory’s arm, guiding him across the back hall.

The hatch doesn’t open.\n\n“Swelled shut,” she says, voice tight, and plants both feet for leverage. She hauls again. The ring bites her palm; she swears, then tries a third time.\n\nThe hatch gives—sudden and ugly—releasing a breath of cold air that smells of damp stone and old apples. The dark below is absolute.\n\nTamsin leans down into it, feeling for the first step. “Lantern—” She pats the shelf, finds one by touch, and fumbles for a match.\n\nFrom the kitchen, the braced door *thumps* again—harder.

The match flares sulfur-bright, and you jam it to the lantern’s wick. The lantern catches with a low *whuff* and a thin, oily smoke that curls up into the pantry air.\n\n“Good,” Tamsin breathes, and immediately swings her legs into the hatch. She takes the lantern from you with both hands, lowers it first, and tests the first step with her boot.\n\n“One,” she says.

It tightens around the iron ring with a wet squeal.\n\nHarker’s face goes tight with panic he refuses to show. “There’s another—” he starts, and the line *pulls*.\n\nHe loses his footing. His boots skid on the damp step and he slams down hard on his hip, knife clattering once against stone before he snatches it back.\n\nTamsin drags the third crate into place with a grunt, eyes locked on Harker. She holds it poised, ready to shove.\n\nThe pale thing at the hatch doesn’t come down yet. Instead, it threads farther into the stairwell—testing the air, then dipping toward the brine-wet track on the cellar floor as if it recognizes it. Where it passes, the lantern flame gutters and leans blue for a second.\n\nJory grabs your wrist suddenly, nails biting. “It’s—following the wet,” he whispers, eyes huge. “Wren… it likes the trail.”\n\nHarker scrambles backward down the steps toward the gap, breathing hard. “Close it the second I’m through,” he snaps at Tamsin—then, to you, “Salt buys seconds. Not minutes.”",

The gap vanishes.\n\nThe crate stack shudders, then holds—pinned tight against the stair’s bottom step. Tamsin braces it with her forearms and spits out, “Done. Don’t—don’t make me do that again.”\n\nYou mash Jory’s sleeve to the back of his knee. It drinks up brine-dark wetness immediately. The soaked fabric clings like cold seaweed. Jory goes rigid, breath caught high in his chest, but he stays still when you tell him.\n\nOn the cellar floor, your salt goes down in a thick, pale arc across the wet track. You sweep it broader with your boot until the shine breaks into dull, gritty patches.\n\nIt works—partly.\n\nWhere the salt hits, the glossy line *stops spreading* and the air gives that same pan-hiss you heard at the hatch. The wetness doesn’t cross the salt easily. But the track doesn’t vanish; it beads up against the salt like a tide meeting a seawall, gathering into darker, thicker droplets.\n\nAbove the crates, something tests the barrier: a pale filament snakes down between two slats, searching for a gap. It touches the salted line and recoils sharply, whipping back out of sight.\n\nThen the hatch ring overhead shrieks—metal on metal—as whatever is up there pulls again. The hatch doesn’t open now, but it *thuds* and *flexes* against its frame, sending dust down like dry grit-snow.\n\nHarker, on your side of the crates, scrambles backward on hands and heels until his back hits the worktable.

The cellar opens into a cluttered storage run: shelves of jars, coffin hardware in labeled tins, old mourning cloth folded in oilpaper. She sweeps the lantern beam left.\n\n“Door,” she says—then corrects herself when she gets closer. “Not a door. A… panel.”\n\nIt’s a narrow wooden panel set into the stone, waist-high, with an iron pull. The edges are swollen with damp, and someone has painted a thin white line around it—old warding chalk, half dissolved. Tamsin grabs the pull and tugs. It doesn’t budge.\n\nShe plants a boot and pulls again. The panel gives a millimeter, then sticks with a wet suction sound.\n\nBehind you, you tear cloth from your shirt and pack it behind Jory’s knee. He bites down hard on his sleeve, eyes squeezed shut. The bleeding slows—more seep than pour now—but the skin around the wound remains waterlogged-looking, as if the brine has soaked into him rather than just the fabric.\n\nYou dust salt around the edges. The salt doesn’t burn him, but it *does* fizz faintly where it touches the brine-wet cloth—tiny bubbles, like the wound is exhaling.\n\nHarker yanks his own scarf free and wraps his forearm over the chewed sleeve, tight. “It stings,” he says, voice clipped. “It’s trying to—” He stops, swallowing. “It’s trying to get under.”\n\nYou lay your thicker crescent of salt nearer the crates. The pooled brine at the first line beads and presses, but doesn’t cross. It builds into a dark, trembling ridge that reflects the lantern like an eye.\n\nThen the crate-stack *knocks*—a single, heavy impact from above, as if something dropped its weight onto the hatch and slid down onto the crates. Dust sifts. The lantern flame leans blue and stays that way a beat too long.\n\nA thin filament snakes through a crack between the top crate and the wall—higher than before—seeking a path around your salt rather than through it.\n\nTamsin looks back, breath sharp. “Wren—this panel’s an exit, I think, but it’s swollen shut. I need help or a tool.”\n\nJory’s voice comes muffled through his sleeve, panicked but controlled. “It’s—going around. Not through.”\n\nThe threat is now clear: whatever is above is probing for gaps around the barricade, and the hatch/crates are taking impacts that could eventually shift the stack.  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Swollen panel (chalk-lined)\"],\"npcs_add\":[]}```",

You lean—slow, controlled—using the lantern shelf as a brace.\n\nAt first, nothing.\n\nThen the panel gives with a thick, wet *schlorp*, like pulling a boot out of mud. The seam opens a finger’s width. Damp air pushes out, smelling of soot, old rain, and something mineral—brick dust. You keep the pressure steady and the gap widens to two fingers… three.\n\nA second consequence comes with it: the chalk line around the panel fractures in one spot as the wood flexes, a hairline break you can’t avoid. The ward isn’t gone, but it’s no longer unbroken.\n\nTamsin slips her fingertips into the widening seam and helps you pull. The panel swings inward a few inches on stiff hinges, revealing a narrow chute-like passage: brick-lined, steep, and dark, with iron rungs set into one side. It goes up, not down.\n\n“Coal chute,” Tamsin says. “Or an old ash run.”\n\nBehind you, Harker snaps, “There!” His knife hand flashes.\n\nA pale filament threads through the crate crack again—now thicker, like a wet cord.

Above, you hear her breath catch as she finds an opening—then her voice, thin but steady.\n\n“Landing—yes. It’s a service lip, maybe two feet deep. There’s a ring-bolt set into a beam—rusted but it’s *there*.”\n\nBelow, you cinch the sacking tight under Jory’s arms. He makes a strangled sound, then forces his fingers to curl around the sling and his own shirtfront like he’s afraid his hands will forget how. His eyes fix on you; he nods once, sharp and obedient.\n\nWhen you grind salt into the wet smear at his knee, it reacts immediately: the sheen dulls from slick-black to a crusted gray, like something drying too fast. A sharp brine-stink rises. Jory hisses through his teeth, then his leg stops twitching. Not healed—just… stilled.\n\nHarker takes the sling end in his left hand and keeps the knife up in his right, blade angled toward the shadowed stacks. “On three,” he says, and actually means it.\n\nYou both haul.\n\nJory’s body slides over the boards toward the chute-mouth—an angled gap between crates where the floor drops away. The first pull goes clean. The second pull jerks hard as the sacking bites under his ribs; Jory’s hands clamp tighter, knuckles whitening.\n\nThen a crate above you shifts—wood groaning, nails complaining. Dust sifts down in a steady sprinkle. Harker freezes for half a heartbeat, knife lifting higher.\n\nFrom inside the dark between the crates comes a soft, wet *click-click*, like a tongue against teeth—too rhythmic to be settling timber.\n\nTamsin, from above: “Hurry. The ring-bolt’ll take a line but the beam’s… Wren, it’s *soft*. Like it’s been soaked.”\n\nYou have Jory started toward the chute, but the stacks are moving, and something in the gaps is awake and tracking the sound of you dragging him.",

For an instant the click-click stops.\n\nThen something recoils inside the dark with a wet, angry *scrape*, like skin dragged over wood. The salt you threw doesn’t just fall—some of it *sticks* in midair to a thin, clear strand you couldn’t see before. The strand snaps back into the gap, pulling grains with it.\n\nA pale shape noses out between two crates: not a whole creature, more like a jointed feeler—translucent, knuckled, and slick—tasting the air.\n\nHarker doesn’t hesitate. He slashes once, clean and brutal.\n\nThe blade bites; the feeler spasms and retreats, leaving a smear on the crate edge that steams faintly where your salt dust clings. The click-click returns, faster now, agitated—still inside, still close.\n\nYou haul Jory the last stretch. His hips bump the chute-mouth; he sucks in a breath and clamps his hands to the sling as instructed. He’s shaking, but he’s following you.\n\nAbove, Tamsin threads the line through the ring-bolt anyway. You hear metal-on-rope rasp, then her boots skitter as she moves. “There’s a railing—old iron!” she calls, and you hear the line wrap with quick, practiced turns. “I’ve got it on metal—twice—stand by!”\n\nYou brace your boots and start easing Jory into the chute. The angle takes him immediately—his weight pulls, the sling goes taut, and for a moment the line threatens to run too fast.\n\nTamsin locks it off up top with a sharp jerk. The rope bites and holds. Jory drops a foot, then stops, suspended and sliding in controlled inches.\n\nBut the crates behind you shift again—this time not just settling. The gap widens as if something is pushing from within. A second feeler presses out, then a third, probing toward the rope and your ankles.\n\nHarker steps into it, knife flashing again, trying to keep them from getting purchase. “Get him DOWN,” he snaps, voice tight with strain, as the slick strands start to web between crate corners—thin lines catching dust, salt, and light.",

But the webbing isn’t all in one place—new strands are already being laid from the gap to the crate corners, faster than before, trying to bridge around the salted patches.\n\n“Tamsin—LOWER, steady!” you call.\n\n“Lowering!” she shouts back, and the rope starts moving again—controlled but quicker. The line slides over iron with a strained, gritty rasp.\n\nYou keep one hand on the sling and feed Jory down in short bursts. He obeys—hands only, no kicking—teeth clenched so hard his jaw trembles. He drops another few feet, then another; the chute swallows him until you only see his shoulders and the sling disappearing into darkness below.\n\nHarker takes your cue and starts cutting *strands*, not stabbing at what’s attached to them. His knife snaps through two lines in quick succession. Each cut makes the webbing recoil like a plucked wire—then whip back, trying to reattach. One strand flicks across Harker’s forearm; he swears and yanks away, sleeve instantly damp where it touched.\n\nThen the threat shifts: a thicker, braided-looking line—still nearly invisible—lashes toward the rope itself, aiming to snag it above your salted section.\n\nHarker lunges and hacks at it. He severs it on the second strike, but the moment it parts, the cut end *spits* a fine mist that beads on the nearest crate and smokes faintly where your salt dust lies.\n\nUp top, Tamsin yelps. The rope jerks—hard—like something tugged it from below or the side. “Something just hit the line!” she cries. “I’m holding—Wren, I’m HOLDING—”\n\nJory drops a sudden extra foot with the jerk and lets out a strangled gasp, but his hands stay on the sling.\n\nYou are seconds from getting him fully down, but the webbing is now actively targeting the rope, and the line has already been struck once.",

The rail is slick with condensation and something colder than water.\n\nYou tear the sea-glass charm free. The cord snaps against your fingers. When you grind the glass down the rail, it squeals like a knife on stone.\n\nThe effect is immediate and ugly: the slick hand *seizes*—its long fingers spasming as the sea-glass scrapes across them. Where the glass passes, the translucent skin clouds, turning milky, and a thin, briny film smokes off it as if the touch burns. The hand loosens its grip for a heartbeat.\n\nBut it doesn’t retreat. It *re-grips lower*, trying to yank the whole ladder again, and the rail you just scraped comes away with a smear of your blood and salt paste—streaks that glow faintly for half a second, then dull.\n\n“Tamsin—take my wrist, NOW!”\n\nTamsin drops flat on her belly at the hatch lip, boots braced, one hand locked around the rope as an anchor. “GIVE IT—” she barks, and clamps her other hand around your wrist with a painful, iron grip. Her fingers are cold from the rope, but steady.\n\nHarker, already on the boards, scrambles to her side and grabs your forearm just above her hand. “Up—UP—don’t slip—”\n\nBetween them they haul. Your hooked boot tears free as you scramble the last rungs, and your lantern swings wildly, throwing blue-tinged shadows across the hatch frame.\n\nBelow, the slick hand lashes upward again—too fast—catching your ankle for a split second. Its touch is like plunging into icy brine. Then your heel clears the lip and the hand loses purchase, raking the ladder rail with nails that leave pale grooves in the wood.\n\nYou’re dragged onto the upper floorboards on your side, chest heaving. Tamsin doesn’t let go of your wrist; she yanks you another foot back from the hatch.\n\nThe ladder *jerks* once more, hard enough that the hatch frame creaks and spits dust. The slick hand clings to the rail below, and something heavier than a hand shifts in the dark—pulling, testing.\n\nTamsin spits down into the opening. “Harker—GET SOMETHING OVER IT. NOW.”\n\nHarker bolts, limping, toward the nearest furniture, already grabbing for anything he can drag.\n\nYour ankle throbs with cold pain where it was grabbed, and the ladder continues to shudder under the thing’s weight—still trying to come up.",

She keeps one fist knotted in the rope and reaches her free hand to squeeze your forearm once—quick, a check-in, not comfort. “I’m fine. Breathe.”\n\nBelow, the slick hand claws up again, knuckles whitening to that milky haze where the sea-glass scraped it. It drags itself to the hatch lip, fingers splaying on the threshold. The wood hisses faintly where your blood-and-salt smear was, as if the grain resents being touched.\n\nHarker returns hauling the chair—your chair—one leg already wobbly from the earlier brace. He rams it toward the opening, but the ladder bucks again and the chair skitters sideways with a screech.\n\n“Hold it—Harker, *hold it!*” Tamsin snaps, shifting her weight to keep the rope taut. The rope bites into her palm; you can see it redden.\n\nThe hand *hooks* the hatch frame, and something unseen pulls behind it—enough force that the hatch rim flexes. A wet, dragging sound follows, like cloth soaked through and wrung out.\n\nYou reach for Tamsin’s forearm; her sleeve is damp with sweat and rope-water. “Don’t let go,” you say—and she doesn’t.\n\nHarker plants his foot, shoves the chair’s seat down over the opening. The slick fingers slap against the underside and *push back*, lifting the chair a fraction before Harker throws his weight onto it.\n\n“There—there!” he gasps. “What now—what now?”\n\nThe chair holds for the moment, but it’s trembling in small, steady pulses from below—testing, patient. Your ankle still aches with cold, and where it was grabbed, the skin is already paling as if frostbitten.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

She shakes her hand once, flexing blood back into her fingers. “Still functional,” she says, voice tight.\n\nYou drag closer on your good knee. The chair over the hatch judders under Harker’s weight in small, rhythmic lifts—like something below is pressing up, then easing off, learning the load.\n\nYou press the sea-glass charm flat to the boards and scrape a line along the hatch seam. The glass catches on old varnish, then bites into raw wood with a harsh, chalky squeal.

A thin, angry hiss leaks up through the crack, brine-sour and cold.\n\nHarker keeps his weight planted, knuckles white on the chair back. “It’s—pushing—” he pants. “I can feel it—like a shoulder—like—”\n\n“Anything iron?” you demand.\n\nHarker jerks his chin toward the pantry hatch area. “Nail tin—by the swollen panel—Jory kept it there—” He swallows as the chair lifts a finger’s width and drops again. “Pry bar—might be in the cellar stair cubby—if it didn’t… if it didn’t move.”\n\nTamsin, now anchored to the table, leans low and peers at the seam you scored. “It doesn’t like that,” she says. Then her eyes snap to your ankle—pale, blotched where it was grabbed. “Wren. That’s not just cold. That’s *taking*.”\n\nBelow, the slick hand scrapes along the underside of the chair—nails dragging—testing for a gap. The chair shifts a fraction toward the unmarked side of the seam, trying to find the path of least resistance.

One corner has been lifted by salt-swollen grain, just enough to show what’s beneath: an older dedication plate, stamped with the Ashford & Daughters transfer-sigil (the little mark you grew up seeing on “don’t ask” parcels) and a date that punches the air out of your lungs.\n\nThe week your mother vanished.\n\nTamsin sees your face change. “Wren—what did you find?”\n\nAt the hatch, Harker’s voice breaks. “It’s—getting a finger under—!”\n\nOne chair leg lifts a fraction as something slick wedges from below, searching for the bare side of the seam.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"Rusted tin with a few bent nails\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

She snatches the nearest heavy thing: the chair slat brace you’d been using earlier, its end wrapped in splintered cloth. “This’ll have to do.”\n\nHarker grunts as the chair bucks again. “Hurry—!”\n\nTamsin crawls in, keeping low, and drives the first nail down beside a chair leg with the brace.

Threaded through both is the Brine-Choir, a harmless-seeming tide-singers’ charity that blesses sailors’ graves, but actually trades in drowned secrets, using buoy-bells to signal meetings and bargains.

Meanwhile the Brine-Choir has announced a public Moon-Collecting Vigil after three fishermen washed ashore with their tongues stitched in brine-thread—an old warning.

The lanterns gutter blue as if the flame has learned a different language, and each morning you find your careful restorations subtly undone—names shaved thinner, dates re-cut with a hand steadier than any vandal’s, plot borders nudged a few inches so the dead wake up in the wrong families. The Lanternward Society smiles too quickly when you mention tool marks. Someone has started using your work as an alibi.\n\nThen the brooding newcomer arrives at your apartment door with sea-mist in his hair and a map of Saltmarrow Cemetery that shouldn’t exist: a maintenance overlay showing “ghost paths,” sealed sections, and a set of plot coordinates inked in your mother’s old shorthand—three looping letters you haven’t seen since the night she vanished above Ashford & Daughters. He doesn’t ask if you remember. He asks what you know. As if forgetting was never an option.\n\nAcross town, Ashford & Daughters locks its private annex and pretends it’s only “inventory.” Inside, the unsanctioned ledgers you grew up dusting are being moved—quietly, urgently—as if the paper itself has started to accuse. And tonight the Brine-Choir’s Moon-Collecting Vigil will draw half the town to the shore, where buoy-bells will moan and bargains will be sung under respectable hymns. Three fishermen have already washed up with tongues stitched in brine-thread: an old warning, meant for someone who listens.\n\nYou are suddenly useful to too many people. The cemetery is being rewritten. Your family’s records are being sealed. And your mother’s trail—once cold—has begun to shine like wet ink."

        "content": "Morning, Saltmarrow Cemetery’s upper tier—Lantern Row—where the path narrows between leaning slate and a low iron fence furred with salt. Sea-mist beads on carved names until they look freshly inked. The lanterns are still lit from last night, and each flame sputters an unhealthy blue that makes the gravel look cold.\n\nYou kneel beside the Harrowell marker, apron tied, hair pinned back the way you learned above Ashford & Daughters. A soft brush clears lichen from a serifed “E,” and your small tools click in your pocket when you shift your weight. You test the stone with a fingertip, careful as if it were skin, then set a stencil to match the original cut. Patience is part of the job; so is noticing what other people hope you won’t.\n\nThe date is wrong.\n\nYesterday the stone read *1889*. Today it reads *1883*, the new “3” cut too clean to be weather. At the base, fresh grit still sits in the chisel line. You lean closer and find a second problem: the border stones around the Harrowell plot have been nudged inward, just enough that the corner now bites into the neighboring family’s ground. That kind of shift takes time, leverage, and permission—unless someone is doing it before dawn.\n\nFootsteps crunch behind you. When you turn, a man stands just inside the gate, coat damp at the shoulders, dark hair still threaded with mist. He doesn’t carry a tour pamphlet or a wreath. He holds a folded sheet of vellum in one hand and keeps the other near his pocket like he’s used to trouble. “Elowen Ashford,” he says, not asking. He opens the vellum just enough for you to see a maintenance overlay of the cemetery—ghost paths, sealed sections—and three plot coordinates inked in your mother’s looping shorthand.\n\n“I bought this from someone who shouldn’t have it,” he says. “Your name was the only instruction.”\n\nThe blue lantern above you gutters hard, as if reacting.\n\nYou have a freshly altered grave at your knees, an impossible map in a stranger’s hand, and a town heading toward the Brine-Choir’s vigil tonight. He waits for an answer, and the cemetery stays very still."

Lanterns along the path sputter with moth-wing shadows; somewhere a bell buoy moans, answered by the soft, punctual click of Wren’s tools in her pocket.

      "Saltmarrow Cemetery is “maintained” by the Lanternward Society, a civic-minded guild of caretakers and historians who host tasteful tours—while quietly editing headstones and burial ledgers to erase certain names. Across town, the Ashford & Daughters Mourning House offers impeccable funerals and grief counsel, yet keeps a private annex of unsanctioned records and relics tied to disappearances along the coast. Threaded through both is the Brine-Choir, a harmless-seeming tide-singers’ charity that blesses sailors’ graves, but actually trades in drowned secrets, using buoy-bells to signal meetings and bargains. The Lanternward leans on Ashford for discretion; Ashford fears the Choir’s reach; the Choir blackmails both, and the cemetery itself keeps score.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"factions\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"The Lanternward Society\",\n      \"public_front\": \"A respected guild of cemetery caretakers, local historians, and lantern-lighters who preserve Saltmarrow’s heritage and run guided tours.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"They alter markers and ledgers to conceal select burials, protect old pacts, and prevent certain deaths from being traced.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Ashford & Daughters Mourning House\",\n      \"public_front\": \"A long-standing funeral home known for gentle rites, grief counsel, and immaculate arrangements for the coastal town.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"They maintain a private annex of unregistered records and recovered items, tracking patterns of vanishings and the people who profit from them.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"The Brine-Choir\",\n      \"public_front\": \"A quaint charitable society of tide-singers who bless sailors’ graves, fund memorials, and lead moonlit vigils at the shore.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"They collect and barter secrets from the drowned, using buoy-bells and coastal rites to coerce favors and steer disappearances.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

      "Lanterns along Saltmarrow’s upper tiers have begun guttering blue, and fresh “restoration” work is appearing overnight: names shaved down, dates re-cut, whole family plots subtly rearranged. The Lanternward Society blames sea-salt and vandals, but Wren finds tool marks too precise to be weather. Meanwhile the Brine-Choir has announced a public Moon-Collecting Vigil after three fishermen washed ashore with their tongues stitched in brine-thread—an old warning.

      "Saltmarrow’s upper tiers have never liked strangers, but lately they don’t even like themselves. The lanterns gutter blue as if the flame has learned a different language, and each morning you find your careful restorations subtly undone—names shaved thinner, dates re-cut with a hand steadier than any vandal’s, plot borders nudged a few inches so the dead wake up in the wrong families. The Lanternward Society smiles too quickly when you mention tool marks. Someone has started using your work as an alibi.\n\nThen the brooding newcomer arrives at your apartment door with sea-mist in his hair and a map of Saltmarrow Cemetery that shouldn’t exist: a maintenance overlay showing “ghost paths,” sealed sections, and a set of plot coordinates inked in your mother’s old shorthand—three looping letters you haven’t seen since the night she vanished above Ashford & Daughters. He doesn’t ask if you remember. He asks what you know. As if forgetting was never an option.\n\nAcross town, Ashford & Daughters locks its private annex and pretends it’s only “inventory.” Inside, the unsanctioned ledgers you grew up dusting are being moved—quietly, urgently—as if the paper itself has started to accuse. And tonight the Brine-Choir’s Moon-Collecting Vigil will draw half the town to the shore, where buoy-bells will moan and bargains will be sung under respectable hymns. Three fishermen have already washed up with tongues stitched in brine-thread: an old warning, meant for someone who listens.\n\nYou are suddenly useful to too many people. The cemetery is being rewritten. Your family’s records are being sealed. And your mother’s trail—once cold—has begun to shine like wet ink."

        "content": "Morning, Saltmarrow Cemetery’s upper tier—Lantern Row—where the path narrows between leaning slate and a low iron fence furred with salt. Sea-mist beads on carved names until they look freshly inked. The lanterns are still lit from last night, and each flame sputters an unhealthy blue that makes the gravel look cold.\n\nYou kneel beside the Harrowell marker, apron tied, hair pinned back the way you learned above Ashford & Daughters. A soft brush clears lichen from a serifed “E,” and your small tools click in your pocket when you shift your weight. You test the stone with a fingertip, careful as if it were skin, then set a stencil to match the original cut. Patience is part of the job; so is noticing what other people hope you won’t.\n\nThe date is wrong.\n\nYesterday the stone read *1889*. Today it reads *1883*, the new “3” cut too clean to be weather. At the base, fresh grit still sits in the chisel line. You lean closer and find a second problem: the border stones around the Harrowell plot have been nudged inward, just enough that the corner now bites into the neighboring family’s ground. That kind of shift takes time, leverage, and permission—unless someone is doing it before dawn.\n\nFootsteps crunch behind you. When you turn, a man stands just inside the gate, coat damp at the shoulders, dark hair still threaded with mist. He doesn’t carry a tour pamphlet or a wreath. He holds a folded sheet of vellum in one hand and keeps the other near his pocket like he’s used to trouble. “Elowen Ashford,” he says, not asking. He opens the vellum just enough for you to see a maintenance overlay of the cemetery—ghost paths, sealed sections—and three plot coordinates inked in your mother’s looping shorthand.\n\n“I bought this from someone who shouldn’t have it,” he says. “Your name was the only instruction.”\n\nThe blue lantern above you gutters hard, as if reacting.\n\nYou have a freshly altered grave at your knees, an impossible map in a stranger’s hand, and a town heading toward the Brine-Choir’s vigil tonight. He waits for an answer, and the cemetery stays very still."

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "You step in, close enough that the vellum’s surface catches the lanternlight. The ink is old-black, not the newer soot-brown the Society uses—your mother’s habit of tightening the downstrokes is there, unmistakable. The stranger doesn’t pull it away, but his grip firms at the corners.\n\nHe answers your questions in the wrong order.\n\n“Because the cemetery is being run like a ledger,” he says, low. “And ledgers have overlays.”\n\nThen: “A lantern-lighter sold it to me. Not one of the public-facing guides—one of the ones who carries keys.” His eyes flick past your shoulder, toward the path behind you, as if expecting someone to be listening. “He didn’t give a name. He had a thumb missing to the first knuckle and smelled like lamp-oil and brine. He said the map was ‘hot’ and that if I wanted the rest of it, I should find you before the Choir started singing tonight.”\n\nAs he speaks, a faint click comes from the iron fence to your left—metal on metal, like a latch being tested. You look: nothing obvious moves, but the chain on the side gate is hanging differently than you remember, the padlock turned outward instead of inward.\n\nThe blue lantern above you sputters again. In that brief stutter, you catch it: a second set of footprints in the damp gravel off the main path—too narrow for the caretaker’s boots you know, toes pointed toward you and the stranger, then scuffed as if someone backed away into the grass.\n\nThe man folds the vellum once, not hiding it fully but making it easier to snatch. “If you want to ask me what I’m doing in Saltmarrow,” he adds, “do it somewhere that isn’t lit like a signal.”\n\nAnother sound—soft, deliberate—comes from the row of headstones behind the Harrowell plot: the scrape of grit under a shoe sole. Whoever it is, they’re close enough now that they’re choosing to be heard."

The stone there holds the night’s chill; the blue lanternlight doesn’t reach cleanly, and the mist seems to hesitate at the carved angels over the door.\n\nHe obeys immediately. The vellum folds in practiced, quick creases and disappears into the inner pocket of his coat. He shifts so his body blocks the mausoleum door seam, eyes fixed on the row of headstones you called out to.\n\nYour voice carries. “Cemetery’s closed…”\n\nFor a beat, nothing answers—only the buoy-bell’s distant moan and the lantern’s wet sputter.\n\nThen someone steps into view between two slates: a Lanternward man in a dark oilskin, lantern-hook belt at his waist. His left hand is wrapped in stained cloth, thumb stump blunt beneath it. He holds a long-handled lantern snuffer like a walking stick, and his face is drawn tight with sleeplessness.\n\nHe stops where the path widens, keeping a respectful distance that still feels like a boundary. “No need to shout, Miss Ashford,” he says, voice mild and rehearsed. “Caretaker sent me to check the blue lamps. Folks have been… fretting.”\n\nBehind him, a second figure doesn’t step out—only a suggestion of movement in the grass line to his right, where the mist thickens. You hear a quiet exhale and the faint clink of something metal being adjusted, like a buckle or a keyring.\n\nThe Lanternward man’s gaze flicks to the Harrowell stone at your knees—wrong date, nudged borders—and then to the stranger’s coat pocket, too quickly to be accidental. “You’ve got company,” he notes, as if it’s casual. “Not a tour day.”\n\nThe stranger beside you goes still. His hand stays visible, empty, but his posture changes—ready.\n\nThe Lanternward man lifts his snuffer a few inches, not threatening exactly, but making it clear he can close lanterns—make dark—fast. “If you’ve found something you shouldn’t,” he says, softer now, “best you hand it over. The Society doesn’t like… misunderstandings. Especially before a vigil.”\n\nHe doesn’t advance. He waits, and the hidden presence in the grass waits with him."

You shift sideways until your shoulder touches the mausoleum’s cold stone, giving you a clean angle on the grass line.\n\nThe Lanternward man’s expression tightens at the question. For a moment he looks like he might ignore it—then he answers, as if forced by habit into politeness.\n\n“Pell,” he says. “Jory Pell.”\n\nHe does not lower the snuffer. Instead, he plants its ferrule on the gravel and leans on it, casual as a cane. “Daylight, office, proper records,” he repeats, tasting the words. “That’s the trouble with you Ashfords. You think paper keeps you safe.”\n\nAt the mention of the Harrowell date, his eyes cut to the stone again. He doesn’t deny it changed. That silence is its own admission.\n\nFrom the grass line to Pell’s right, the hidden figure finally commits: a woman steps half out of the mist, not Lanternward-uniformed—plain dark dress, hair pinned tight, a ring of keys on a chain at her waist. She doesn’t look at you first; she looks at the stranger, then at Pell, and gives the smallest nod, like confirming a description.\n\nPell speaks again, voice still mild, but the edges are sharper. “You can keep your voice down and we can all walk away tidy. Or you can shout for a caretaker who isn’t on this tier, and my friend here—Mara—will make sure your shouting doesn’t carry.”\n\nMara’s hand comes up. Not a weapon—an oiled cloth and a small glass bottle. The smell hits even from a few paces: sharp, sweet, medicinal. Ether or something like it.\n\nThe threat is clear now: they’re not here to argue policy. They’re here to take the map and, if necessary, quiet you.\n\nPell shifts his weight forward one step, closing distance. “Last chance,” he says, eyes on the stranger’s coat pocket. “Hand it over.”\n\nThe blue lantern above you gutters hard, and for a second the path is darker—enough for Mara to angle her body as if preparing to rush from the grass."

Gravel sprays across the path in a harsh hiss, pelting Pell’s oilskin and skittering under his boots. His next step slips; he catches himself with the snuffer’s ferrule, metal scraping stone.\n\nYou seize the stranger’s sleeve and shove him into motion. He doesn’t argue—he bolts, coat tails snapping, heading down Lantern Row exactly as you ordered.\n\nMara moves immediately. She lunges after him, keys clinking, bottle and cloth up like she’s done this before. Pell barks, “Not the girl—get the map!” and surges forward toward you instead, trying to cut you off from following.\n\nYou shout—full-throated, tearing sound that bounces off slate and marble: “CARETAKER—UPPER TIER! HELP!”\n\nThe tier answers with movement, not a voice. From farther downslope, a lantern flares brighter—someone has heard, or at least seen the commotion. But it’s not close.\n\nPell closes the distance fast. He swings the snuffer not at your head, but low, aiming to hook your ankle or knock your legs out from under you. You jerk back against the mausoleum stone; the snuffer’s rim clips your shin with a hard, numbing smack.\n\nPain blossoms hot and immediate. Your leg holds, but it stings and your balance wobbles.\n\nMara is already several strides after the stranger—then she hesitates as your shout carries. She glances back once, calculating, and hisses something to Pell you don’t catch.\n\nPell’s face changes—less polite, more urgent. “You’ve made it messy,” he snaps, and reaches with his free hand for your wrist, trying to pin you to the mausoleum wall and keep you from giving chase or screaming again.\n\nDown Lantern Row, the stranger is a dark shape running through blue-guttering pools of light—Mara gaining on him in the mist, cloth raised.\n\n**Threat, clear:** Pell is trying to restrain you physically; Mara is attempting to catch the stranger and use the drugged cloth on him to take the map."

Up there!” Footsteps start pounding uphill, still far—at least half a tier down.\n\nPell recovers fast. His face goes mean with embarrassment. “Shut—up,” he spits, and swings the snuffer again, higher now, aiming to clip your shoulder and drive you back into the mausoleum’s shadow. The rim catches your upper arm—hard enough to make your fingers go numb for a second, not enough to drop you.\n\nYou fumble for your water tin—small, dented, half-full—and fling it down the path toward Mara.\n\nIt sails low and fast, then bounces off a headstone base with a loud *clang* and skitters into the gravel, spraying water in a brief arc. The noise makes Mara flinch and glance back.\n\nYour shout—“HEY—MARA! PUT IT DOWN!”—lands. Mara’s jaw tightens; she doesn’t put anything down. She changes tactics.\n\nShe stops chasing straight at the stranger and instead cuts across the grass to intercept him where Lantern Row narrows between two leaning stones. Keys flash at her waist as she moves. The cloth stays raised, bottle in her other hand.\n\nThe stranger is still running, but he’s about to hit that pinch-point in the path—Mara is positioning to step into him from the side and clamp the cloth over his face.\n\nBehind you, Pell steps in again, closer than before.

Pell folds with a choked noise, the snuffer clattering against the mausoleum stone. He staggers sideways, one hand cupped between his legs, the other held up and bleeding, eyes watering with rage.\n\n“DON’T TOUCH ME,” you snarl through the cloth.\n\nYou scream again, voice tearing: “LANTERN ROW—SHE’S GOT ETHER!”\n\nThat word changes the air.

She darts in from the side, cloth snapping up toward his face.\n\nBut your shout and your next call hit in the same instant: “LEFT—OFF THE ROW, THROUGH THE YEW BREAK!”\n\nThe stranger commits on instinct.

Mara’s cloth brushes his cheek—not a full seal—and he stumbles into the branches, coughing, but he’s still moving.\n\nMara swears, sharp and low, and plunges after him.

Don’t breathe deep if she’s got ether.”\n\nTolan hesitates—eyes flicking from you to Pell to the dark gap in the yews—then he breaks into a run, lantern bobbing, boots crunching hard as he angles left toward the thicket.\n\nPell, half-pinned by the lantern pole, tries to straighten and put on indignation. “This is—this is Ashford trouble—she’s—”\n\n“Hands,” the broad one orders.\n\nHe shifts the lantern pole to keep Pell’s snuffer arm trapped against the mausoleum stone, then uses his free hand to wrench Pell’s other wrist up and slap it flat to the wall. Pell hisses in pain. The broad Lanternward pats Pell down briskly—coat pockets, waist, inner breast.\n\nHis fingers find something. He pulls out a small glass vial wrapped in oiled cloth. When he uncorks it a hair, a sharp, sweet-chemical smell cuts even through your apron.\n\nPell’s face goes tight. “That’s not—”\n\nThe broad Lanternward corks it immediately and stares at Pell like a door has closed. “Ether,” he says, flat. Then, to you, without softening: “Wren Ashford. I know the name. Don’t move from here.”\n\nHe yanks Pell’s snuffer hand open. The snuffer drops; the broad Lanternward kicks it away across the gravel where it rings against a headstone base.\n\nFrom the yew break comes a sudden muffled cough—male, rough—followed by Mara’s voice, breathless and furious: “Stop—STOP—”\n\nTolan’s lanternlight flashes through the branches as he arrives, and you hear him shout, “Lanternward! Mara, stand down!”\n\nThe threat is still active in the yews: Mara is close enough to be heard, ether is confirmed, and the stranger is coughing—possibly exposed."

You hear a brief, ugly struggle—fabric tearing, someone’s elbow striking wood—then Tolan yells, “Cloth! She’s got a cloth—”\n\nThe broad Lanternward makes a decision. He shoves Pell harder into the mausoleum and plants his lantern pole across Pell’s chest like a bar.\n\n“Don’t move,” he tells Pell, low. Then, to you: “You stay where I can see you. If you know the breaks, point. Loud.”\n\nHe breaks into a run toward the yew line, lantern in hand, boots slipping once on gravel before catching. As he goes, he calls, “Tolan—drag him out!

It skitters, spins, and leaves a wet-looking track of condensation on the path. The air bite spikes—your eyes water hard even through the scarf.\n\nOn your right, the flanking shape commits: a crouched figure darts from behind a headstone, closing the gap toward Halden’s position. You see a pale sleeve and a hand holding something small and dark—too compact to be a pole, more like a tool or knife.\n\nYour shout reaches the incoming Lanternward. Both of them accelerate instantly, poles coming up. “LEFT YEW!” one calls back, voice rough. The other veers right, trying to cut off the flanker’s line.\n\nHalden reacts to your order with the only leverage he has: he grabs a flat, palm-sized stone from the path edge with his boot and kicks it—hard—so it skids and slaps over the vial. It doesn’t pin it perfectly, but it partially covers it, and the glass stops rolling.\n\nThe effect changes: instead of “activating” in the open air, the sting becomes a concentrated, sharp plume seeping around the stone’s edges—still dangerous, but less widespread.\n\nThe casualty, downwind, coughs again and curls inward, trying to get his face away from the air. He’s conscious enough to flinch.\n\nThe left yew attacker retreats a half-step deeper—branches swallowing the hook-pole again—while the right-side flanker is now within a few strides of Halden and the casualty, moving fast and low.\n\nImmediate threat: the flanker is about to reach Halden/casualty; the vial is partially covered but still venting irritant around the stone; Lanternward are closing but not yet in contact."

Whatever they were holding—a compact, dark-handled tool—flies from their grip and skips across the path, disappearing into the grass by the mausoleum’s edge.\n\nThey hit the ground hard on one shoulder and roll, fast and practiced, trying to get their legs under them again. Close enough now, you catch details: a cemetery work-coat, salt-stained at the cuffs; a scarf tied high; and a smear of pale clay on one glove like fresh stone dust.\n\n“Halden—back, keep him behind you!” you bark.\n\nHalden obeys, hauling the casualty another half-step downwind and putting his own body squarely between the fallen attacker and the man on the ground. He raises his pole defensively like a quarterstaff, breathing through his teeth. “Stay DOWN,” he snaps.\n\nYour shout to the right-side Lanternward lands at exactly the right moment. The Lanternward who’d veered right closes the last yards at a run and brings their pole down—not striking the attacker’s head, but jabbing the ferrule into the attacker’s hip and ribs to pin them to the gravel.\n\n“Hands!” the Lanternward barks. “Hands where I can see them!”\n\nThe attacker freezes for a fraction of a second… then does something uglier: they twist their torso and slam their palm into the gravel, crushing something small under their glove. There’s a sharp *crack*—like a vial or ampoule breaking.\n\nA thin, icy-white vapor puffs up around their hand and along the ground, hugging low like it’s heavier than air. It’s not a big cloud yet, but it’s spreading toward Halden’s boots and the casualty’s legs.\n\nThe Lanternward recoils half a step, swearing, and yanks their scarf up over their mouth. “Brine-sweet!” they rasp. “Don’t breathe it!”\n\nFrom the left yews, the hook-pole scrapes stone again—still there, still moving—while the partially covered vial near the path continues to vent a sharp plume around the stone.\n\nRight now the clear threats are:\n- a new low-lying vapor spreading from the flanker’s crushed ampoule toward Halden and the casualty,\n- the original vial still venting near the path,\n- the left-side attacker remains in the yews with a hook-pole, uncontained."

She looks from the casualty being hauled uphill to the grit-smeared vial patch, and then to you.\n\nThe pinned attacker’s gaze snaps to her and shuts like a door.\n\nUnder the Lanternward’s pole, the attacker rasps, “No one *sent* me.”\n\nThen, after a pause that’s almost a dare: “Ask the Choir where they keep their ‘blessings.’”\n\nThe tide-singer’s smile doesn’t move, but her eyes do—down to the ground, to the vapor hugging the gravel, measuring distance like she’s counting steps."

He looks past you to the volunteer first, then to the two Lanternward bracing Jory. His jaw works once. Still, he peels off from the parallel drift and strides upslope, keys already in hand.\n\n“North shed’s sealed for relamping,” he says, loud enough to be a rule rather than an answer. Then, lower, to you as he passes: “If you’re forcing it, you’re owning it.”\n\nHe reaches the north lantern-shed: a squat timber box with a copper vent cap and a door banded in iron. The key ring clinks. He tries the first key—wrong. Second—wrong. Third—**it turns**, but not cleanly. Something inside the lock resists like grit.\n\nHe puts his shoulder in, and the door opens a handspan with a wet-sounding sigh, as if the hinge has been recently oiled with something thicker than oil. A ribbon of cold, blue light leaks out at ankle height.\n\nThe Brine-Choir volunteer doesn’t answer your question directly. They smile wider, and their thumb strokes the hymn-book’s spine—one, two, three—like counting.\n\n“Brine-tithe isn’t *payment*,” they say. “It’s **due**. And names aren’t erased, Wren. They’re… *moved to where they belong.*”\n\nThey tilt their chin toward the shed. “You should be careful what you open. The Lanternward hates a mess.”\n\nAt your glance, Jory blinks once—hard—then a second time, slower. The two Lanternward holding them tighten their grip automatically. Jory’s throat works as if swallowing water that isn’t there, but they keep their lips sealed.\n\nThen the lanterns along your tier gutter in sequence—left to right—blue flames bowing as if in a wind that only they can feel. The “pull” hits the group as a physical tug: not enough to drag feet, but enough to make balance go wrong. Gravel skitters under boots.\n\nFrom inside the shed comes a clear, small sound: **a tool laid carefully on wood**.\n\nThe caretaker freezes with the door half-open, keys still in his fist. “Someone’s in there,” he says, voice gone flat. “And they weren’t supposed to be.”"

They string out into an awkward line, each with a hand on the next person’s sleeve or belt. It steadies them, but not cleanly—two of them stagger anyway when the lanterns gutter again, and their boots scrape half-moons in the gravel.\n\nYou call into the crack of blue light.\n\nFor a beat, nothing.\n\nThen a shape shifts inside—just beyond the threshold—blocking the spill of light. A voice answers from low height, as if the speaker is crouched.\n\n“Don’t—” it says, and the word catches like a hook in the throat. “Don’t close it.”\n\nA hand appears first, palm out, fingers stained dark as if with ink or old varnish. Then the other. Slow, careful. Whoever it is keeps their body behind the doorframe.\n\nThe caretaker leans closer despite himself. “That’s… that’s lantern-oil,” he mutters, seeing the shine on the wrist. “Fresh.”\n\nBehind you, Jory does what you asked: eyes fixed on you, breathing shallow through cloth. Their shoulders still twitch with the tide-pull, but they don’t turn toward the lanterns. One of the Lanternward holding them whispers a prayer through clenched teeth; another tightens their grip hard enough to leave a bruise.\n\nThe Brine-Choir volunteer’s smile thins at your threat. They don’t step back; they step *sideways*, angling so they can see into the shed as if they have a right.\n\n“Iris wasn’t ‘moved’ to a place,” they say, voice suddenly precise. “She was moved to a **line**. A margin. A footnote that can be folded shut.”\n\nThey lift their hymn-book slightly, showing its damp-swollen pages. On the inside cover—pressed into the paper like a watermark—three looping letters in your mother’s shorthand.\n\n“Ask your family’s annex,” the volunteer adds. “Ask what they keep when grief won’t stay buried.”\n\nInside the shed, the hidden person’s hands tremble. Something metallic scrapes on wood again—closer to the threshold now—like a tool being nudged into reach. The blue light flares once, brighter, and the lanterns along the tier answer with a synchronized bow.\n\nThe threat is immediate and physical: if the flare pulses again, the line of Lanternward may go down like toppled stones—and whoever’s inside may bolt through the gap while everyone’s footing fails."

It doesn’t slide away from the threshold. It slides **toward** it, then pauses, as if the person’s arm is being argued with.\n\nTheir hands rise higher, palms still out. The lantern-oil sheen on their wrists catches the blue spill.\n\n“I’m not supposed to have one,” they whisper. “If I put it down, it— it sees.”\n\nThe caretaker beside you swallows and keeps his hand on the latch, but his eyes flick to the mounting bracket above the door—where a chalk-salt scrawl sits half-hidden under the iron banding. He doesn’t touch it. He looks like he knows better.\n\nYour blade-voice at the Brine-Choir volunteer lands. They finally take a step back—one pace, not a retreat, more like granting you “space” they think they control. Their hymn-book remains open, thumb still marking that inside cover.\n\n“Whose hand?” they echo, and their gaze slides past you to the lantern-glass along the path, watching reflections. “You want a hand, Wren? Watch the ones that never get dirty.”\n\nAs they say it, a lamp-tender down the tier—trimming a wick, shooing moths from the glass—stills for half a second, then resumes with exaggerated calm. She doesn’t look at you directly; she watches you in the lantern pane, counting with her thumb against the oil-can.\n\nThe blue light in the shed pulses again—stronger. The iron braid on the nearest path-lantern (third on the left past the rosemary offerings) answers with a faint, tight *click* from inside its housing, like a latch engaging.\n\nThe threat becomes concrete: the ward-lantern has “woken.” If anyone lunges or grabs at the bracket/sigil area, it will react—fast—like a guard-dog made of light and iron.\n\nInside the shed, the crouched figure flinches at that click.

The blue pulse in the nearby lantern doesn’t stop, but it dulls a fraction, like an eye half-lidded. He keeps his wrist there, trembling.\n\nInside the shed, the unseen person swallows hard. A face edges into the crack of the door: young, salt-pale, with lantern-oil on their fingertips and a smear of chalk at the corner of their mouth as if they’ve been biting it.\n\n“L—Lio,” they say, barely a breath. “Lio Marr.”\n\nThe hooked tool clinks as it’s set down—carefully, not thrown.

Both hands.”\n\nBehind her, farther down the path, a bell answers—distant, single-toned, not the buoy-bell’s moan but a crisp cemetery bell.

Don’t step toward the blue.”\n\nBeside him, a woman in a neat oilskin apron lifts a small slate and a stub of chalk.

The moth-shadow spiral tightens toward Lio for a heartbeat—then loosens, circling wider, as if it’s listening for the next syllable.\n\nThe woman with the slate stops advancing.

His jaw tightens. “Stay where you are, Nessa.”\n\nNessa doesn’t stop. She reaches a post and unhooks a small tin rattle-lantern—an auxiliary light—and begins to climb the side steps, keeping it low.\n\nConcrete threat: Nessa is approaching with another lantern and a “ledger-page” angle, and the ward-lantern is already showing it can snap toward the nearest moving hands if the light pattern or voices change abruptly.

Not the annex overlay. The public one.” It’s an order meant to sound routine.\n\nNessa, still frozen on the stair, calls up quietly, “Supervisor, the public map won’t show the seam breaks.”\n\nHarker doesn’t look at her. “It will show what it’s *supposed* to show.”\n\nConcrete threat: Harker is already steering this toward an “official” version of events.

There’s a sharp *sizzle* and the smell of scorched salt and singed wool. The caretaker jerks, choking on a cry, and his sleeve smokes where the ribbon hit.\n\nHis pain reflex yanks his arm—still linked to yours—down and away.\n\nYour linked grip breaks.\n\nThe moment contact is lost, the chalk-salt beneath his sleeve flares through the fabric in a bright, cold glow, as if the mark has been waiting for air. The shed door shudders once from the inside, not from Lio—something deeper, like a latch answering a different hand.\n\nImmediate threat: the ward-lantern is now “awake” and reactive, having successfully struck once. The chalk-salt mark has ignited under the caretaker’s sleeve, and the shed door just moved as if something inside responded to the flare."

He’s shaking so hard his teeth click once.\n\nHarker reacts to your order with a hard look, then chooses control over pride. “Jory—hold!” he snaps at the caretaker. To his partner: “Cloth. From the kit. White.”\n\nThe Lanternward woman with the slate tucks it under her arm, crouches without suddenness, and pulls a folded linen from a satchel at her hip—clean, pressed, official. She doesn’t throw it. She slides it across the gravel toward you with two fingers so it doesn’t *skitter*.\n\nAs you lift your soot-marked hands an inch off the shed door, the door gives a faint answering tremor—like a throat clearing behind wood. The latch does not open, but the seam darkens as if something inside pressed close and then eased away.\n\nYou pinch the edge of Jory’s smoking sleeve with two fingers and begin to peel.\n\nThe cloth resists at first, singed fibers sticking to whatever’s underneath. You go fraction by fraction. The ward-lantern tracks those two fingers with predatory attention, but it holds—no strike—so long as your motion stays slow and your voice stays even.\n\nWhen the sleeve finally lifts enough to expose the chalk-salt, you see it clearly:\n\nA scrawl of pale crystals and chalk, threaded with something wet-black, drawn in a looping shorthand that looks uncomfortably like old funeral-home notation—three looping letters repeated and crossed through. The exposed portion flares brighter the moment it hits open air, the glow crawling outward along the lines like frost spreading on glass.\n\nJory whimpers and tries to pull away on instinct.\n\nHarker barks, “Hold, Jory!”\n\nJory clamps down, knuckles white, trembling in place.\n\nLio stays on their knees, hands still up, eyes fixed on you. They don’t touch the frame. They whisper, barely audible, “It’s the same hand.”\n\nConcrete, immediate threat: the mark is actively “feeding” on air exposure—its glow intensifies as you uncover it—and the shed door has already responded once.

He keeps his hook-lantern fixed, but he angles it slightly away from Jory’s forearm, reducing the blue’s direct attention.\n\nJory swallows and nods once, fast. “I’m—holding,” he manages, voice thin.\n\nThe Lanternward woman with the slate speaks as she writes again, crisp and audible. “Recorded: ‘Lio Marr said, It’s the same hand.’” Her chalk pauses at the end of the sentence, then continues—she’s adding more than you asked, the scratch of it quickening as if she doesn’t want to forget what she saw.\n\nAt your question about shorthand, Harker’s posture tightens.

Like it’s wrapped.”\n\nYou slide your hand a fraction on the oilcloth. Beneath it, the bundled shape at his shin gives a faint, wrong little pulse—too slow to be blood, too deliberate to be muscle. Jory flinches when it does, jaw clenched so tight his molars show.\n\nHarker doesn’t argue. He drops to a knee by the door, shoves a broken plank and a wedge of stone into the bottom corner, then drives it home with the heel of his hand. The frame complains with a dry crackle. Tamsin drags a salt-sack from the wall and rams it against the latch side, bracing her shoulder into it like she expects the whole world to lean back.\n\n“Not opening,” she says, breath sharp. “Not for prayers, not for mothers.”\n\nYou press your mouth to the seam.\n\nFor a moment there’s only the surf’s distant heave and the buoy-bell’s moan—then something scrapes the outside of the door, slow and careful, like a fingernail testing grain.\n\nMerrick’s voice comes through the wood, close enough you can hear his teeth click when he speaks.\n\n“I opened the second step,” he says, each word measured like he’s paying for them. “The one with the old nail in it. I shouldn’t’ve—Lanternward said it was sealed, but—”\n\nHe breaks off. Something wet taps the door twice from the outside. Not a knock. A drip.\n\n“I took a name,” Merrick goes on, hoarse now. “Not mine. I thought it was just a *word* you carry to keep the sea from choosing you. That’s what the Choir said. ‘Borrow it till the next moon.’”\n\nHe draws a breath that shudders.\n\n“It was your mother’s shorthand on the stone. Three loops.

Like wet sand in a stocking.”\n\nUnder the oilcloth, that wrong pulse at his shin answers with a slow thump-thump, as if whatever’s wrapped there heard it had been noticed.\n\nAt the door, you feel the seam vibrate faintly when Merrick shifts his weight on the other side. He takes your warning; when he speaks again, he avoids the name like it’s a hook.\n\n“The mark—three loops—was on a small slate,” he says, voice tight. “Not a headstone. A boundary slate. Half-buried at the tide steps’ top landing, left side as you face down to the water. Loops cut shallow, like someone didn’t want it seen unless you knew to look.”\n\nA pause. A swallow. Then, word for word, he recites, and you can hear his shame in the precision:\n\n“*By lantern-law and brine-breath, I unstep what was stepped. I take what was taken. I carry it till called.*”\n\nAs he finishes, something outside drags along the door’s lower edge—metal on wood—searching. The bar shivers once, hard enough to make Tamsin grunt and brace more of her weight into the salt-sack.\n\nHarker crouches and pours a thin white line of salt along the inside threshold, careful not to break it.

It can’t.” He swallows, and his gaze flicks down toward his shin. “It’s… dropping. Back down. Quiet.”\n\nUnder the salted pad at his shin, you feel one faint, resentful *tick*—then nothing you can distinguish from your own pulse.\n\nAt the door, the sustained lean releases. Not a retreat—more like a decision. The blue dots in the hinge crack dim to almost nothing.\n\nThen a new sound replaces the pressure: a slow, deliberate scratching along the outside of the door, low near the lock, like a nail searching for a seam. Harker goes rigid, listening.\n\nTamsin whispers, barely audible: “It’s not trying to get in the way it was.”\n\nThe immediate threat has shifted: the brine can’t bypass your salt barrier now, but whatever is outside has stopped brute forcing the door and has begun working at the lock/edge—methodical, patient, and close.  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[\"Harker\",\"Tamsin\",\"Jory\"]}```"

He drags the salt crock to the door, crouches, and shoves salt into the keyhole with the blunt end of a spoon—packing it until it mounds and spills. The scratching outside pauses the moment the salt hits metal, then resumes higher, closer to the latch.\n\n“Wax,” Harker mutters. He glances toward the stove and snatches a stubby candle from the mantle. He lights it off the low flame, lets it drip, and smears hot wax over the salted keyhole and along the seam where the lock plate meets the door. The wax hisses faintly as it cools.\n\nOutside, the nail (or whatever is doing the work) scrapes once—hard—right over the lock area. The door shudders. A thin line of wax fractures, but holds. Then the sound changes: not scratching now, but a careful *pressing* along the edge, as if something flat is being slid into the seam to feel for weakness.\n\nTamsin nods and darts away from the kitchen, skirts gathered in both hands. You hear cupboards open, a hurried rummage, then her voice from the back hall: “Cellar’s through the pantry—there’s a hatch!”\n\nA beat later: “Window’s painted shut—won’t budge!”\n\nShe returns with a rigid length of wood—a broken chair slat, still attached to a crosspiece like a crude brace—and a strip of twine. “This was all I could find,” she says, breathless, holding it out.\n\nJory flinches as the pressure at the door increases—he’s listening as much as you are. You lean close and give your instruction.\n\nHe swallows, then whispers through the linen, urgent and hoarse: “I— I don’t hear ticking. But… I feel it. Like… like a finger tapping from inside the bone.”\n\nAt the same moment, the salted wrap behind his knee darkens in one spot—damp spreading through the fabric from within, not from the outside. The salt there begins to clump and sag.\n\nAt the door, the seam gives a hair’s breadth with a soft *click*—not open, but loosened. Whatever is outside has found something to worry at.\n\nYou have two immediate, concrete problems:\n1) The thing in Jory is wetting the wrap from the inside and may be dissolving its own salt barrier at the back of the knee.\n2) The door’s lock seam has shifted; the outside presence is actively working the gap and is closer to forcing entry than it was seconds ago."

Jory goes still as if you’ve pinned a live wire. “It’s… mad,” he whispers. “Like it’s testing.”\n\nHarker doesn’t argue. He lunges for the sideboard by the wall and heaves it—wood screeching over the floorboards—into a slam against the door. He shoves the kitchen table in behind it, wedging the legs so the whole stack braces at an angle.\n\nThe outside pressure answers immediately. The door bows inward a fraction and the wax along the lock seam cracks in a jagged line. Something thin scrapes along the gap—metal on wood—trying to find purchase.

She takes the lantern from you with both hands, lowers it first, and tests the first step with her boot.\n\n“One,” she says.

Your shoulder blocks most of the beam, and Tamsin obligingly angles it down at the floor and the panel seam.\n\n“Center. Got it,” she breathes, and keeps her fingers off the chalk ring.\n\nYou hook your fingers under the iron pull. The metal is cold enough to bite. You lean—slow, controlled—using the lantern shelf as a brace.\n\nAt first, nothing.\n\nThen the panel gives with a thick, wet *schlorp*, like pulling a boot out of mud. The seam opens a finger’s width. Damp air pushes out, smelling of soot, old rain, and something mineral—brick dust. You keep the pressure steady and the gap widens to two fingers… three.\n\nA second consequence comes with it: the chalk line around the panel fractures in one spot as the wood flexes, a hairline break you can’t avoid. The ward isn’t gone, but it’s no longer unbroken.\n\nTamsin slips her fingertips into the widening seam and helps you pull. The panel swings inward a few inches on stiff hinges, revealing a narrow chute-like passage: brick-lined, steep, and dark, with iron rungs set into one side. It goes up, not down.\n\n“Coal chute,” Tamsin says. “Or an old ash run.”\n\nBehind you, Harker snaps, “There!” His knife hand flashes.\n\nA pale filament threads through the crate crack again—now thicker, like a wet cord. Harker slashes. The blade *does* cut it, but the filament doesn’t bleed; it recoils and the severed end lashes once on the cellar side, spattering a fan of brine across the floorboards.\n\nWhere the brine lands, it starts to creep—avoiding your salt crescent, but flowing toward the chalk-lined panel like it’s been given a new scent.\n\nHarker, breathing hard, shoves a pinch of salt into the crate crack with his free hand. The salt hisses and the crack goes still.\n\nJory calls out hoarsely from the floor, “It’s—cold—” He grits his teeth. “Behind my knee. Like something’s trying to pull the wet deeper.”\n\nThe immediate threat is now twofold and concrete: the hatch-and-crate barrier is being probed by brine-filaments, and spilled brine is actively creeping toward your newly opened exit seam, where the warding chalk has a break."

The line is dense, not a dusting—bright and deliberate. When you press your sea-glass charm into the fractured chalk, it seats with a small *click* against the stone, and for a second the lantern’s blue lean steadies toward normal amber.\n\nThe creeping brine reaches the edge of your new salt half-circle and stalls, bunching up into a glossy ridge. It tries once—thin tendrils testing for a weak point—then draws back, as if reconsidering.\n\nHarker takes your warning seriously. He steps between the crates and the panel, knife out, and starts *scraping* salt into any floor crack that points toward the doorway. “On it,” he says. His wrapped arm trembles, but he keeps moving.\n\nYou crawl to Jory and slide an arm under his shoulders. He’s heavier than he looks—deadweight from pain and shock.

Then your heel clears the lip and the hand loses purchase, raking the ladder rail with nails that leave pale grooves in the wood.\n\nYou’re dragged onto the upper floorboards on your side, chest heaving. Tamsin doesn’t let go of your wrist; she yanks you another foot back from the hatch.\n\nThe ladder *jerks* once more, hard enough that the hatch frame creaks and spits dust. The slick hand clings to the rail below, and something heavier than a hand shifts in the dark—pulling, testing.\n\nTamsin spits down into the opening. “Harker—GET SOMETHING OVER IT. NOW.”\n\nHarker bolts, limping, toward the nearest furniture, already grabbing for anything he can drag.\n\nYour ankle throbs with cold pain where it was grabbed, and the ladder continues to shudder under the thing’s weight—still trying to come up."

She keeps one fist knotted in the rope and reaches her free hand to squeeze your forearm once—quick, a check-in, not comfort. “I’m fine. Breathe.”\n\nBelow, the slick hand claws up again, knuckles whitening to that milky haze where the sea-glass scraped it. It drags itself to the hatch lip, fingers splaying on the threshold. The wood hisses faintly where your blood-and-salt smear was, as if the grain resents being touched.\n\nHarker returns hauling the chair—your chair—one leg already wobbly from the earlier brace. He rams it toward the opening, but the ladder bucks again and the chair skitters sideways with a screech.\n\n“Hold it—Harker, *hold it!*” Tamsin snaps, shifting her weight to keep the rope taut. The rope bites into her palm; you can see it redden.\n\nThe hand *hooks* the hatch frame, and something unseen pulls behind it—enough force that the hatch rim flexes. A wet, dragging sound follows, like cloth soaked through and wrung out.\n\nYou reach for Tamsin’s forearm; her sleeve is damp with sweat and rope-water. “Don’t let go,” you say—and she doesn’t.\n\nHarker plants his foot, shoves the chair’s seat down over the opening. The slick fingers slap against the underside and *push back*, lifting the chair a fraction before Harker throws his weight onto it.\n\n“There—there!” he gasps. “What now—what now?”\n\nThe chair holds for the moment, but it’s trembling in small, steady pulses from below—testing, patient. Your ankle still aches with cold, and where it was grabbed, the skin is already paling as if frostbitten.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```"

She shakes her hand once, flexing blood back into her fingers. “Still functional,” she says, voice tight.\n\nYou drag closer on your good knee. The chair over the hatch judders under Harker’s weight in small, rhythmic lifts—like something below is pressing up, then easing off, learning the load.\n\nYou press the sea-glass charm flat to the boards and scrape a line along the hatch seam. The glass catches on old varnish, then bites into raw wood with a harsh, chalky squeal. Where the sea-glass passes, the seam darkens with a wet-looking sheen and a faint salt-fog beads up as if the wood is sweating.\n\nUnder the chair, the pressure *stutters*—one push falters mid-rise, as if the thing below flinched from the seam you marked. A thin, angry hiss leaks up through the crack, brine-sour and cold.\n\nHarker keeps his weight planted, knuckles white on the chair back. “It’s—pushing—” he pants. “I can feel it—like a shoulder—like—”\n\n“Anything iron?” you demand.\n\nHarker jerks his chin toward the pantry hatch area. “Nail tin—by the swollen panel—Jory kept it there—” He swallows as the chair lifts a finger’s width and drops again. “Pry bar—might be in the cellar stair cubby—if it didn’t… if it didn’t move.”\n\nTamsin, now anchored to the table, leans low and peers at the seam you scored. “It doesn’t like that,” she says. Then her eyes snap to your ankle—pale, blotched where it was grabbed. “Wren. That’s not just cold. That’s *taking*.”\n\nBelow, the slick hand scrapes along the underside of the chair—nails dragging—testing for a gap. The chair shifts a fraction toward the unmarked side of the seam, trying to find the path of least resistance. Harker throws his shoulder into it to keep it centered, but he’s shaking.\n\nThe threat is still directly under you, pressing, probing—held back only by Harker’s weight, the rope’s tension, and the thin, salt-wet line you’ve just carved."

Harker is half-sliding, boots scrabbling for purchase on the boards. “It’s under—” he gasps, voice going thin.\n\nYou jam the sea-glass charm to the bare side and scrape hard. The glass shrieks against wood, carving a rough, salt-wet line. The moment the line closes the gap, the pressure from below *stops*—not gone, but checked, like a shoulder hitting a locked door. A hiss leaks up through the seam, sharper than before, and something slick slaps the underside of the chair in irritation.\n\nTamsin flips the tin open. “These are—Wren, these are bent to hell.”\n\n“Use them,” you snap.\n\nShe grabs two nails, forces them straighter against the floor with the heel of her hand—crude, but enough to bite. Then she looks up, jaw tight. “Hammer?”\n\nNo hammer is in her hands.

The nail bends slightly, but it pins the chair leg enough that it can’t skate sideways.\n\nUnder the chair, the thing responds immediately: a hard upward shove that lifts the chair a fraction. The pinned leg holds; the unpinned side jolts, and the chair twists. Harker nearly spills, catching himself with a palm on the floor.\n\nThen the smell hits—brine and iron—because your clenched fist has reopened.
