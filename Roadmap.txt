ensure user is given campaign id 
Create a save function & set up runtime memory storage. Story so far, character sheet, locations, key people, world events
test continuing campaign given campaign id. Should this be the same assitant code or change the intro to give this as an option
Web app - easy light weight web app, maybe unity. There are probably some chat gpt assistant web app templates somewhere

Further items:
define scene on entry, save key info to a scene save (e.g. if there is a meeting somewhere, are there guards, what is the risk level, are there predefined outcomes beased on obvious player routes)
embedings for context in campaign to improve results and recall over long campaign.
