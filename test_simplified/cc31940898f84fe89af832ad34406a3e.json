Two shots: the nearest van’s plate, rain-beaded and readable under the alley light; then the gurney as it bumps past—Jonah Pike on the toe-tag, the tag stock too clean, the knot wrong. The second photo catches a corner of the transfer packet clipped to the rail: a stamped block that reads **TRANSFER AUTHORIZED — M. KEENE** before a Lanternman shoulder blocks it.\n\nYou step out just enough to be seen, palms open, voice flat like you’ve said it a thousand times. “Keene—audit’s here. You want that bay door open or you want them waiting?”\n\nImmediate effect: Keene freezes mid-step. Her eyes flick to the front lot where headlights wash the main entrance, then back to you. For half a breath she looks relieved—like you handed her an excuse—then the relief curdles into suspicion. “Who the hell are you?” she snaps, but she’s already moving: she jabs two fingers toward the bay door control panel to her left, then points at the Lanternmen like she’s directing traffic. “Hold. Two minutes.”\n\nThe driver’s hand on the latch stops. Not relaxes—stops. He keeps his fingers hooked under the handle, ready. He looks past you, not at you, like he’s checking for a second set of eyes in the rain. Doc Vellum shifts in close to Keene, voice low but you catch the edge of it over the engines: “If they step into intake, we’re done. Move it.”\n\nBehind you, through the chain-link gap, the front entrance doors open and a pair of municipal types in raincoats start across the lot—clipboards tucked to their chests, one of them already dialing someone, annoyed.\n\nThe alley smells like wet diesel and disinfectant leaking from a cracked service vent to the west wall. The pressure is immediate: if Keene opens the bay now, she’s inviting the audit into the back corridors; if she stalls them, she has to explain why.\n\n**Status updates:**  \n- Photos secured: plate, toe-tag  \n- Keene: stalled transfer, suspicious  \n- Audit team: approaching front entrance  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"2 phone photos (Lanternmen van plate; Jonah Pike toe-tag + partial transfer packet stamp)\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"St. Brigid Morgue — rear loading bays/service alley\"],\"npcs_add\":[\"Mara Keene (night supervisor)\",\"Doc Vellum (Halcyon fixer)\",\"Lanternmen van driver (unidentified)\",\"Municipal audit team (2 visible)\"]}```",

The loading bay door motor groans and starts to climb, spilling a slice of freezer-cold air and bleach stink into the alley.\n\nYou call out, loud, toward the two raincoats crossing the front lot. “Audit! Rear intake’s the active door—follow my voice.”\n\nOne of them stops dead, turns his head, and squints through the rain like he’s trying to place your face. The other—shorter, hair tucked under a hood—keeps walking but changes angle, heading toward the service alley with the annoyed, purposeful stride of someone who doesn’t like surprises. The taller one raises his voice back, sharp: “Who authorized rear intake? Identify yourself!”\n\nKeene leans close enough that you catch cigarette-mint on her breath. “If you’re not on my roster, Mercer, you’re about to be my problem.” But she’s already putting on her “routine” voice, louder, for the auditors to hear: “Evening, municipal. We’re staging overflow through rear intake due to a refrigeration service call.”\n\nTo your left, the Lanternmen driver’s hand tightens on the van latch—knuckles pale. He doesn’t open it yet. Doc Vellum’s eyes flick from the auditors to you, then to Keene, calculating. He murmurs, just audible: “That wasn’t in the plan, Mara.” His tone says *fix it*.\n\nInside the rising bay door, fluorescent light reveals a short corridor: yellow mop bucket, a wall-mounted key box, and a security camera above the doorframe pointed straight down the alley—its red status LED steady, recording.\n\nA figure across the street under an awning—shopfront measuring tape around their neck like a lanyard—pauses mid-cigarette and watches the bay open, then steps back inside as if to “get out of the rain.”\n\n**Status updates:**\n- Bay door: opening, rear corridor exposed  \n- Audit team: rerouting toward alley  \n- Lanternmen transfer: paused, tense",

Officially: overdose, unclaimed, processed through **St. Brigid Morgue Services**. Unofficially: Jonah’s sister slid Silas a damp envelope yesterday—photocopies of an intake sheet that doesn’t match the death certificate. Same date, same toe-tag number, two different fingerprints. In the corner, a smudged stamp: **TRANSFER AUTHORIZED — M. KEENE**.\n\nTonight, rain turns the curb into a mirror outside St. Brigid’s loading bays. A municipal audit team is arriving early. Too early. That kind of surprise only happens when someone wants the books clean or the bodies gone. Through a chain-link gap, Silas spots a Lanternmen convoy idling in the service alley—three vans, engines low, drivers smoking like they’re waiting for a bell. A man in a dry coat—Doc Vellum, if Silas’s old collections contacts are right—leans close to the night supervisor, urgent enough to be threatening.\n\nSilas already has one thing he shouldn’t: a morgue access badge number written on the back of Jonah’s sister’s letter, the ink bled by tears and weather. If he uses it, doors might open. If he mentions it, someone will know he has it.\n\nAcross town, Halcyon’s free clinic goes dark—power failure, locked exits, panicked families. The scanner on Silas’s police-band crackles with the first calls. Two crises, one pipeline. And Jonah’s name is about to move again—unless Silas gets there first, or gets noticed trying."

The city breathes in slow, cigarette-wet gulps—diesel, cheap cologne, boiled coffee left too long on a burner. Sirens pass like distant arguments you’ve learned to ignore. Inside, radiators knock with impatient knuckles; outside, wind worries at loose signage and the gutters speak in constant whispers. Fluorescents in back corridors buzz like trapped insects, bleaching faces and making skin look borrowed. Paper is always damp at the edges. Metal is always cold.

Halcyon pays, St. Brigid supplies, Lanternmen deliver—until missing relatives, rival crews, and Silas’s questions turn their shared pipeline into a knife fight.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"factions\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"St. Brigid Morgue Services\",\n      \"public_front\": \"A reputable municipal contractor modernizing morgue operations and deathcare logistics.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Alters toe-tags and intake records to launder bodies and identities through the city system for profit and leverage.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"The Halcyon Benevolent Trust\",\n      \"public_front\": \"A philanthropic foundation funding clinics, shelters, and public health initiatives.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Finances covert 'continuity' programs—organ harvesting, identity recycling, and hush payments—using morgue access to source and erase.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"The Lanternmen\",\n      \"public_front\": \"A hard-nosed labor outfit providing dock, sanitation, and security manpower.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Runs the transport network for illicit cargo: bodies, paperwork, and bribes moved through tunnels and service corridors.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

      "Silas Mercer hasn’t slept right since the case that ended with a name on his tongue and an empty chair at the precinct—**Jonah Pike**. Officially: overdose, unclaimed, processed through **St. Brigid Morgue Services**. Unofficially: Jonah’s sister slid Silas a damp envelope yesterday—photocopies of an intake sheet that doesn’t match the death certificate. Same date, same toe-tag number, two different fingerprints. In the corner, a smudged stamp: **TRANSFER AUTHORIZED — M. KEENE**.\n\nTonight, rain turns the curb into a mirror outside St. Brigid’s loading bays. A municipal audit team is arriving early. Too early. That kind of surprise only happens when someone wants the books clean or the bodies gone. Through a chain-link gap, Silas spots a Lanternmen convoy idling in the service alley—three vans, engines low, drivers smoking like they’re waiting for a bell. A man in a dry coat—Doc Vellum, if Silas’s old collections contacts are right—leans close to the night supervisor, urgent enough to be threatening.\n\nSilas already has one thing he shouldn’t: a morgue access badge number written on the back of Jonah’s sister’s letter, the ink bled by tears and weather. If he uses it, doors might open. If he mentions it, someone will know he has it.\n\nAcross town, Halcyon’s free clinic goes dark—power failure, locked exits, panicked families. The scanner on Silas’s police-band crackles with the first calls. Two crises, one pipeline. And Jonah’s name is about to move again—unless Silas gets there first, or gets noticed trying."

KEENE** before a Lanternman shoulder blocks it.\n\nYou step out just enough to be seen, palms open, voice flat like you’ve said it a thousand times. “Keene—audit’s here. You want that bay door open or you want them waiting?”\n\nImmediate effect: Keene freezes mid-step. Her eyes flick to the front lot where headlights wash the main entrance, then back to you. For half a breath she looks relieved—like you handed her an excuse—then the relief curdles into suspicion. “Who the hell are you?” she snaps, but she’s already moving: she jabs two fingers toward the bay door control panel to her left, then points at the Lanternmen like she’s directing traffic. “Hold. Two minutes.”\n\nThe driver’s hand on the latch stops. Not relaxes—stops. He keeps his fingers hooked under the handle, ready. He looks past you, not at you, like he’s checking for a second set of eyes in the rain. Doc Vellum shifts in close to Keene, voice low but you catch the edge of it over the engines: “If they step into intake, we’re done. Move it.”\n\nBehind you, through the chain-link gap, the front entrance doors open and a pair of municipal types in raincoats start across the lot—clipboards tucked to their chests, one of them already dialing someone, annoyed.\n\nThe alley smells like wet diesel and disinfectant leaking from a cracked service vent to the west wall. The pressure is immediate: if Keene opens the bay now, she’s inviting the audit into the back corridors; if she stalls them, she has to explain why.\n\n**Status updates:**  \n- Photos secured: plate, toe-tag  \n- Keene: stalled transfer, suspicious  \n- Audit team: approaching front entrance  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"2 phone photos (Lanternmen van plate; Jonah Pike toe-tag + partial transfer packet stamp)\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"St. Brigid Morgue — rear loading bays/service alley\"],\"npcs_add\":[\"Mara Keene (night supervisor)\",\"Doc Vellum (Halcyon fixer)\",\"Lanternmen van driver (unidentified)\",\"Municipal audit team (2 visible)\"]}```"

I’m the guy you call when paperwork starts sweating.” I nod toward the front lot. “They’re coming in hot; you do not want them standing at the main desk. Open the bay, bring them through intake—looks clean, feels routine.”\n\nWithout waiting for her answer, I step back a half pace and call out toward the approaching raincoats, loud enough to carry: “Audit! Rear intake’s the active door—follow my voice.”"

        "content": "“Mercer—contract compliance. I’m the guy you call when paperwork starts sweating.”\n\n**Immediate outcome:** Keene buys it—halfway. Not because she believes you, but because your lie gives her a script that keeps the auditors out of her front office and away from whatever’s on the computer terminals.\n\nRain hisses off the bay’s corrugated awning as she snaps, “Rear intake is *not* an active door—unless I say it is.” Then she swipes her badge at the panel anyway. The loading bay door motor groans and starts to climb, spilling a slice of freezer-cold air and bleach stink into the alley.\n\nYou call out, loud, toward the two raincoats crossing the front lot. “Audit! Rear intake’s the active door—follow my voice.”\n\nOne of them stops dead, turns his head, and squints through the rain like he’s trying to place your face. The other—shorter, hair tucked under a hood—keeps walking but changes angle, heading toward the service alley with the annoyed, purposeful stride of someone who doesn’t like surprises. The taller one raises his voice back, sharp: “Who authorized rear intake? Identify yourself!”\n\nKeene leans close enough that you catch cigarette-mint on her breath. “If you’re not on my roster, Mercer, you’re about to be my problem.” But she’s already putting on her “routine” voice, louder, for the auditors to hear: “Evening, municipal. We’re staging overflow through rear intake due to a refrigeration service call.”\n\nTo your left, the Lanternmen driver’s hand tightens on the van latch—knuckles pale. He doesn’t open it yet. Doc Vellum’s eyes flick from the auditors to you, then to Keene, calculating. He murmurs, just audible: “That wasn’t in the plan, Mara.” His tone says *fix it*.\n\nInside the rising bay door, fluorescent light reveals a short corridor: yellow mop bucket, a wall-mounted key box, and a security camera above the doorframe pointed straight down the alley—its red status LED steady, recording.\n\nA figure across the street under an awning—shopfront measuring tape around their neck like a lanyard—pauses mid-cigarette and watches the bay open, then steps back inside as if to “get out of the rain.”\n\n**Status updates:**\n- Bay door: opening, rear corridor exposed  \n- Audit team: rerouting toward alley  \n- Lanternmen transfer: paused, tense"
