The air tastes like hot dust and antiseptic.\n\nThe figure is lean, dockside gear—not corporate armor. A cheap rebreather hangs loose at their throat. Their eyes keep flicking to your left wrist.\n\n“Easy—easy,” they say, voice pitched low. “I’m not HCS. If I was, you’d be zip-tied already.”\n\nThey swallow, then nod toward your wrist tag like it’s a live grenade. “Helix pinged me because it pinged *everything* in this block that ever touched Helix auth. You lit up the whole dead-net when your tag chirped. I was tracking the handshake—wanted to see if it was real or a spoof.”\n\nBehind them, down the corridor to the west, a service hatch is half-open—someone’s been using it recently; the screws are finger-loose and the sealant is torn. Past that, faint insectile relay-chatter starts up again, three bursts, then stops, like something listening for your response.\n\nThe dockside operative keeps their palms visible, but their gaze keeps measuring distances—your knife, the dropped pistol, the service hatch. “Name’s Sable,” they say quickly. “Reclaimer-side. Broker didn’t tell you the other part, did he? HCS posted a quarantine bulletin an hour ago—‘armed deserter attempting unauthorized entry.’ No face yet, but they’re pushing patrols into the docks. They’re looking for *your* wrist tag signature.”\n\nAs if to confirm it, your comm unit ticks once—an automated system scan brushing the channel, not a voice, just a cold ping that feels like a searchlight.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES:**  \n- Corridor contact: Reclaimer “Sable”  \n- HCS scan ping: active nearby  \n\n```json\n{\"npcs_add\":[{\"name\":\"Sable\",\"notes\":\"Reclaimer-side operative; claims to have tracked Helix auth handshake; warns HCS bulletin/patrols keyed to wrist tag signature.\"}],\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Dockside locker-bay corridor\"]}\n```",

It slams into your face and hands, turns your gloves tacky in a heartbeat, and smears the corridor lights into long, bleeding streaks across your vision. Sable chokes and tries to suck their rebreather into place with shaking fingers.\n\nSomething small and fast **skitters** in the turbulence—too many taps to be one set of feet—riding the pressure wave out past your boots and into the corridor you just came from.\n\nThe relay chatter you heard earlier accelerates instantly, insectile clicks stacking into a rhythm that feels like a heartbeat finding a tempo.\n\n**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re half-in, half-out of the **service crawl** to the west—ribbed maintenance ducting, damp insulation, and a grated deck slick with condensed mist. Behind you, the locker-bay corridor is now a fogged choke point lit by stuttering emergency strips.\n\nSable’s voice comes ragged through the rebreather seal. “—backwash—damn it, the seal was holding differential—” They grab your forearm hard, not to fight you, but to keep from falling. “If that fog hits a patrol’s optics, they’ll light this whole block up. And if it’s *contaminated*—” They don’t finish, eyes tracking the swirling haze like it might grow teeth.\n\nDown the corridor behind you, the kicked pistol clacks again—either settling… or being nudged by something you can’t see.\n\nInside the crawl ahead, deeper darkness folds around a narrow run of manual equalization valves—old brass-handles, labeled in Helix shorthand.

The pay is obscene. The fine print isn’t—delivery location is an HCS-controlled tender, and the broker insists on a live biometrics handshake using a Helix-issued wrist tag. The same battered tag Rika has kept hidden since the court-martial.\n\nWithin hours, HCS posts a quarantine bulletin naming an “armed deserter” believed to be attempting unauthorized entry. Her face isn’t on it—yet—but the description is too accurate to be a guess. CAIO reaches out through a legal intermediary offering “conditional exoneration” if she turns over any recovered logs immediately. They also ask, casually, whether she still has *anything* from Helix.\n\nHelix Station answers her approach with power flickers and a relay that chatters like an insect trapped in a vent. Something inside still recognizes her credentials. Something else is impersonating the dead.\n\nThe core is the only place that can clear her name. It’s also where everyone else wants her to go first."

Past that, faint insectile relay-chatter starts up again, three bursts, then stops, like something listening for your response.\n\nThe dockside operative keeps their palms visible, but their gaze keeps measuring distances—your knife, the dropped pistol, the service hatch. “Name’s Sable,” they say quickly. “Reclaimer-side. Broker didn’t tell you the other part, did he? HCS posted a quarantine bulletin an hour ago—‘armed deserter attempting unauthorized entry.’ No face yet, but they’re pushing patrols into the docks. They’re looking for *your* wrist tag signature.”\n\nAs if to confirm it, your comm unit ticks once—an automated system scan brushing the channel, not a voice, just a cold ping that feels like a searchlight.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES:**  \n- Corridor contact: Reclaimer “Sable”  \n- HCS scan ping: active nearby  \n\n```json\n{\"npcs_add\":[{\"name\":\"Sable\",\"notes\":\"Reclaimer-side operative; claims to have tracked Helix auth handshake; warns HCS bulletin/patrols keyed to wrist tag signature.\"}],\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Dockside locker-bay corridor\"]}\n```"
