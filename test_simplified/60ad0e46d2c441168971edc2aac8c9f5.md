### Turn 4 [PLAYER]

Liora Thimblewick grew up in the lantern-lit catacombs beneath a smiling city, where she learned to read omens in soot and listen to secrets in stone. A wandering curiosmith and amateur occult cartographer, she trades trinkets and questions in equal measure. Inquisitive, bright-eyed, and stubbornly optimistic, she pokes at curses the way others poke at pies. She’s determined to map the “Hollow Paths” that stitch nightmares to fairy roads, hoping to find the lost lullaby that keeps the dark from remembering her name.

*Agent reasoning: Generated curious-style character for Dark Fantasy fantasy, whimsical, adventure*

### Turn 5 [GAME]

Here's your character:

**Liora Thimblewick**
*Wandering curiosmith and amateur occult cartographer*

Liora was raised in the lantern-lit catacombs beneath the ever-smiling city of Grinwick, where she learned to read omens in soot-streaked glass and hear old truths in patient stone. Adopted by a guildless procession of caretakers, rat-catchers, and candle-priests, she grew up trading favors for stories and sketching forbidden passages no one admitted existed. A childhood brush with a nameless shadow left her oddly “unremembered” by certain dark things—safe for now, but only as long as the lost lullaby remains unsung.

**Traits:** Inquisitive, Bright-eyed optimist, Stubborn, Quick-witted, Fearless (in a reckless, pie-poking way)
**Goal:** To map the Hollow Paths that stitch nightmares to fairy roads and recover the lost lullaby that keeps the dark from remembering her name.

### Turn 9 [GAME]

Midnight settles in the catacombs under Grinwick, where lanterns glow like honey and the air tastes of tallow and sweet rot. Liora Thimblewick tells herself she is only excited, not afraid, and the lie feels light as paper. She wants the Hollow Paths the way some people want sunlight, and she hates that her own name can slip out of other minds like a fish.

She kneels by a collapsed lantern-niche and wipes soot from a shard of glass with her sleeve. She holds it to a nearby flame and watches her inked corridors twitch into a second map, as if the glass remembers a different city. The blue-guttering lantern beside her spits and sighs, and she taps its metal belly like it is a stubborn pie crust. The stone answers with a slow drip that lands too neatly to be water.

She pauses and listens for the rat-bell in the distance, the one the Rat-Catchers’ Procession use to count tunnels and toll for coin. She marks its rhythm in tiny cartographer’s ticks, and the marks feel like a lullaby’s bones. Her odd blessing-cusp shows itself again, quiet and rude. A passing Candle-Priest novice—one of the corridor-wardens who bless lamps and sell safety—glances at her, starts to frown, then looks through her as if she turned into fog.

The pattern snaps into focus. The bell’s beats match her ticks, and the blue light flares on the off-beat like a throat trying to sing backward. From the lacquered mural ahead—freshly sealed by the Guild of Varnished Smiles, the cheery restorers who repaint walls to “fix” memory—a painted eye turns wet and looks straight at her, waiting for her response.

### Turn 10 [PLAYER]

I lean in until my breath fogs the varnish and tap just beneath the painted eye with my fingernail. “All right then—what do you see when you look at me?” I half-turn and softly call after the Candle-Priest novice, “Hey—sorry—can you tell me what you were about to say, before I… vanished?”

*Agent reasoning: The mural-eye is clearly a clue to the Hollow Paths, and the novice’s “forgetting” might be useful to test my odd blessing—so I’ll investigate the eye closely and probe for conversation without escalating too fast.*

### Turn 11 [GAME]

Your fingernail clicks on varnish—too hard, too new—and the fog of your breath blooms across the painted eye like milk in tea.

**Immediate outcome:** the mural reacts.

The eye doesn’t blink. It *slides* beneath the lacquer, pupil drifting a finger-width toward your tapping as if the wall is trying to line you up with a sight. Then the varnish warms under your nail and gives a tiny *tack*—not cracking, not peeling, just enough to cling. When you pull back, a hair-thin thread of clear lacquer stretches after your fingertip and snaps, leaving a pinprick of your skin stinging, like you’ve been lightly bitten.

A voice comes from the wall—not loud, not quite audible, more like the inside of a seashell pressed to your ear:

“**I see a door that isn’t painted yet.**  
**I see a girl-shaped omission.**  
**I see the bell counting you wrong.**”

Behind you, to the east along the corridor where the honey-lanterns thin into blue, the Candle-Priest novice stops mid-step at your call. Her shoulders hitch like she’s snagged on an unseen hook. She turns halfway, eyes searching, and for a second recognition *almost* lands.

“I was—” she whispers. “I was going to say—”

Her gaze slips off you. Her brow smooths. The moment collapses.

“Sorry,” she says, polite and blank, like you’re a stranger at a checkpoint. “Are you… lost? The lower ways are being lacquer-sealed. Don’t stand near the murals. They—” Her words catch; she swallows. “They *keep* things.”

As if to prove it, the varnished eye behind your fogged breath tightens its focus. Somewhere deeper in the tunnels, the rat-bell answers with a single heartbeat-chime—then another—slightly out of time with the lantern’s blue gutter, like two songs fighting over the same throat.

Down the corridor beyond the sealed mural, you hear soft brushes and the wet squeak of rollers: Guild restorers working fast, sealing something *tonight*. Their lamplight flickers through a side-vent like a moving smile.

**Status updates:**  
- Mural: aware, “tracking” you  
- Novice: memory slipping again  
- Guild work-crew: nearby, active

### Turn 12 [PLAYER]

I cradle my stung fingertip, squinting at the tiny spot of lacquer like it owes me rent. “Keeping things—like names? Like faces?” I ask the mural under my breath, then turn to the novice and hold up my soot-smudged map shard. “I’m Liora—if you forget me again, remember the glass. What were you going to warn me about, exactly, and where is the ‘door that isn’t painted yet’?”

*Agent reasoning: The mural is “keeping” things and tracking me; I want to learn what it means by an unpainted door and why the bell counts wrong. The novice is a fragile thread of info, so I’ll anchor her with something tangible while I test the lacquer bite on my fingertip.*
