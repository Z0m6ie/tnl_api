When you pull back, a hair-thin thread of clear lacquer stretches after your fingertip and snaps, leaving a pinprick of your skin stinging, like you’ve been lightly bitten.\n\nA voice comes from the wall—not loud, not quite audible, more like the inside of a seashell pressed to your ear:\n\n“**I see a door that isn’t painted yet.**  \n**I see a girl-shaped omission.**  \n**I see the bell counting you wrong.**”\n\nBehind you, to the east along the corridor where the honey-lanterns thin into blue, the Candle-Priest novice stops mid-step at your call.

They—” Her words catch; she swallows. “They *keep* things.”\n\nAs if to prove it, the varnished eye behind your fogged breath tightens its focus. Somewhere deeper in the tunnels, the rat-bell answers with a single heartbeat-chime—then another—slightly out of time with the lantern’s blue gutter, like two songs fighting over the same throat.\n\nDown the corridor beyond the sealed mural, you hear soft brushes and the wet squeak of rollers: Guild restorers working fast, sealing something *tonight*. Their lamplight flickers through a side-vent like a moving smile.\n\n**Status updates:**  \n- Mural: aware, “tracking” you  \n- Novice: memory slipping again  \n- Guild work-crew: nearby, active",

In the margins, Liora has annotated a detail she can’t explain: a lullaby’s rhythm marked in cartographer’s ticks, each beat matching the distant rat-bell’s heartbeat-chime.\n\nTwo nights ago, a Candle-Priest novice cornered her at a checkpoint and whispered a warning without meeting her eyes: *“The hymn-slate is being sung backward. Someone is using your door.”* Then the novice forgot her mid-sentence—blinked, frowned, and asked who she was. Liora’s old curse, the one that makes certain dark things “unremember” her, is spreading sideways… to the living.\n\nNow the Guild of Varnished Smiles is lacquering murals at a frantic pace, sealing exits and repainting watchful eyes into blank cheer. A Guild restorer carries a warrant for “stolen sketches” with Liora’s handwriting copied too neatly. Meanwhile, the Rat-Catchers’ Procession offers protection—at triple price—and one guide slips Liora a name-tag made of rat-bone, insisting she wear it where it can be seen.\n\nThe blue lanterns are failing faster near places Liora has mapped. In those pockets, footsteps echo like they belong to someone else, and the walls seem to listen for a lullaby no one admits to knowing."

The Rat-Catchers’ Procession offers escorts at triple price, but some guides are quietly selling clients’ names to the dark to survive the shifting routes.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"events\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"The Blue-Guttering Lantern Panic\",\n      \"description\": \"Lantern-light in the lower catacombs is turning blue and failing as a hymn-slate is rumored to be sung backward at Candle-Priest altars, causing marked safe corridors to fray into Hollow Paths.\",\n      \"tensions\": [\n        \"Pilgrims and workers vanish when ‘safe’ routes fold into nightmare roads\",\n        \"Candle-Priests tighten checkpoints and blame sabotage, risking riots\",\n        \"Whoever controls the hymn-slate can reroute or ‘remember’ travelers at will\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Overnight Lacquer-Seals of the Varnished Smiles\",\n      \"description\": \"The Guild of Varnished Smiles is rapidly repainting and lacquering murals to erase a newly ‘seen’ forbidden door—possibly linked to Liora’s cartography—locking down entire sections and rewriting what the walls remember.\",\n      \"tensions\": [\n        \"Sealed murals trap people and cut off supplies, provoking desperate tunnel-breaks\",\n        \"Guild agents hunt for sketches and witnesses to eliminate contradictions\",\n        \"Rat-Catchers exploit the chaos, charging more while some barter clients’ names to darkness for protection\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
      "Liora Thimblewick’s newest map is drawn on soot-streaked glass scavenged from a collapsed lantern-niche—pretty, fragile, and wrong. When held to any guttering-blue flame, the lines shift into a second set of corridors: Hollow Paths stitched through the “safe” routes the Candle-Priests swear are still blessed. In the margins, Liora has annotated a detail she can’t explain: a lullaby’s rhythm marked in cartographer’s ticks, each beat matching the distant rat-bell’s heartbeat-chime.\n\nTwo nights ago, a Candle-Priest novice cornered her at a checkpoint and whispered a warning without meeting her eyes: *“The hymn-slate is being sung backward. Someone is using your door.”* Then the novice forgot her mid-sentence—blinked, frowned, and asked who she was. Liora’s old curse, the one that makes certain dark things “unremember” her, is spreading sideways… to the living.\n\nNow the Guild of Varnished Smiles is lacquering murals at a frantic pace, sealing exits and repainting watchful eyes into blank cheer. A Guild restorer carries a warrant for “stolen sketches” with Liora’s handwriting copied too neatly. Meanwhile, the Rat-Catchers’ Procession offers protection—at triple price—and one guide slips Liora a name-tag made of rat-bone, insisting she wear it where it can be seen.\n\nThe blue lanterns are failing faster near places Liora has mapped. In those pockets, footsteps echo like they belong to someone else, and the walls seem to listen for a lullaby no one admits to knowing."

        "content": "Midnight settles in the catacombs under Grinwick, where lanterns glow like honey and the air tastes of tallow and sweet rot. Liora Thimblewick tells herself she is only excited, not afraid, and the lie feels light as paper. She wants the Hollow Paths the way some people want sunlight, and she hates that her own name can slip out of other minds like a fish.\n\nShe kneels by a collapsed lantern-niche and wipes soot from a shard of glass with her sleeve. She holds it to a nearby flame and watches her inked corridors twitch into a second map, as if the glass remembers a different city. The blue-guttering lantern beside her spits and sighs, and she taps its metal belly like it is a stubborn pie crust. The stone answers with a slow drip that lands too neatly to be water.\n\nShe pauses and listens for the rat-bell in the distance, the one the Rat-Catchers’ Procession use to count tunnels and toll for coin. She marks its rhythm in tiny cartographer’s ticks, and the marks feel like a lullaby’s bones. Her odd blessing-cusp shows itself again, quiet and rude. A passing Candle-Priest novice—one of the corridor-wardens who bless lamps and sell safety—glances at her, starts to frown, then looks through her as if she turned into fog.\n\nThe pattern snaps into focus. The bell’s beats match her ticks, and the blue light flares on the off-beat like a throat trying to sing backward. From the lacquered mural ahead—freshly sealed by the Guild of Varnished Smiles, the cheery restorers who repaint walls to “fix” memory—a painted eye turns wet and looks straight at her, waiting for her response."

It *slides* beneath the lacquer, pupil drifting a finger-width toward your tapping as if the wall is trying to line you up with a sight. Then the varnish warms under your nail and gives a tiny *tack*—not cracking, not peeling, just enough to cling. When you pull back, a hair-thin thread of clear lacquer stretches after your fingertip and snaps, leaving a pinprick of your skin stinging, like you’ve been lightly bitten.\n\nA voice comes from the wall—not loud, not quite audible, more like the inside of a seashell pressed to your ear:\n\n“**I see a door that isn’t painted yet.**  \n**I see a girl-shaped omission.**  \n**I see the bell counting you wrong.**”\n\nBehind you, to the east along the corridor where the honey-lanterns thin into blue, the Candle-Priest novice stops mid-step at your call. Her shoulders hitch like she’s snagged on an unseen hook. She turns halfway, eyes searching, and for a second recognition *almost* lands.\n\n“I was—” she whispers. “I was going to say—”\n\nHer gaze slips off you. Her brow smooths. The moment collapses.\n\n“Sorry,” she says, polite and blank, like you’re a stranger at a checkpoint. “Are you… lost? The lower ways are being lacquer-sealed. Don’t stand near the murals. They—” Her words catch; she swallows. “They *keep* things.”\n\nAs if to prove it, the varnished eye behind your fogged breath tightens its focus. Somewhere deeper in the tunnels, the rat-bell answers with a single heartbeat-chime—then another—slightly out of time with the lantern’s blue gutter, like two songs fighting over the same throat.\n\nDown the corridor beyond the sealed mural, you hear soft brushes and the wet squeak of rollers: Guild restorers working fast, sealing something *tonight*. Their lamplight flickers through a side-vent like a moving smile.\n\n**Status updates:**  \n- Mural: aware, “tracking” you  \n- Novice: memory slipping again  \n- Guild work-crew: nearby, active"

What were you going to warn me about, exactly, and where is the ‘door that isn’t painted yet’?”"
