### Turn 4 [PLAYER]

Silas Mercer grew up in the back rooms of a failing pawnshop, learning early how to read desperation in a person’s hands and eyes. Now a private investigator who double-checks every detail before he ever knocks on a door, he survives by noticing what others miss. Careful, observant, and quietly stubborn, he keeps his thoughts close and his conclusions closer. He’s determined to uncover who’s been laundering bodies through the city’s morgue—because the first name on the list belongs to someone he couldn’t save.

*Agent reasoning: Generated cautious-style character for Noir Mystery*

### Turn 5 [GAME]

Here's your character:

**Silas Mercer**
*Private Investigator*

Silas Mercer was raised in the back rooms of his family’s failing pawnshop, where he learned to read people by what they clutched, what they sold, and what they couldn’t bear to part with. After a brief stint doing off-the-books skip tracing for a collections outfit, he went legit as a private investigator, building a reputation for methodical work and an almost unnerving attention to detail. A recent case left him with a name he can’t forget—someone he failed to save—and it now anchors his obsession with the city’s strangest pattern of missing dead.

**Traits:** Careful, Observant, Quietly stubborn, Skeptical, Patient
**Goal:** Uncover who is laundering bodies through the city morgue and why, starting with the first falsified identity on the list—the person Silas couldn’t save—and bring the operation into the light no matter who it implicates.

### Turn 9 [GAME]

It is 2:17 a.m. behind St. Brigid Morgue Services, the city contractor that handles the dead, on the lower river road. Rain turns the loading bay asphalt into black glass and makes the sodium lights look sick.

Silas Mercer waits in the gap between a dumpster and a chain-link fence. He counts the seconds between dock door checks and writes them in a pocket notebook with a pencil that still works when paper sweats. He watches hands, not faces, and he clocks who touches keys, who touches badges, and who never lets go of a phone.

A Lanternmen convoy idles in the service alley, the labor outfit that moves freight and muscle for cash. Three vans sit nose-out, engines muttering, wipers ticking like metronomes. A man in a dry coat—Doc Vellum, a fixer for the Halcyon Benevolent Trust that bankrolls clinics and buys silence—leans into the night supervisor’s space and talks without moving his mouth. Mara Keene, St. Brigid’s night supervisor, signs something on a clipboard with a pen that doesn’t belong to her.

Silas sees the error nobody else will. The gurney they rush out carries a toe-tag with Jonah Pike’s name, but the knot is tied wrong for St. Brigid’s usual intake, and the tag stock is newer than the damp paperwork in Keene’s hand. The audit team’s sedan rolls up front, headlights washing the bay door. Keene looks toward the alley, then toward the main entrance, and makes a choice.

The Lanternmen driver reaches for the van latch. Silas has Jonah’s badge number in his pocket, and one chance to decide whether to open a door or stop a van.

### Turn 10 [PLAYER]

I stay in cover and snap a couple quick photos of the van’s plate and the toe-tag as it bobs past, then I step out just enough to call, “Keene—audit’s here. You want that bay door open or you want them waiting?” keeping my hands visible and my voice like I belong, buying seconds while I watch the driver’s hands on the latch.

*Agent reasoning: If that van rolls, Jonah “Pike” disappears for good. But rushing it blind gets me cracked. I need a quick look—plate, driver, any markings—and a way to stall without exposing myself.*

### Turn 11 [GAME]

Your phone comes up quick from behind the dumpster’s edge. Two shots: the nearest van’s plate, rain-beaded and readable under the alley light; then the gurney as it bumps past—Jonah Pike on the toe-tag, the tag stock too clean, the knot wrong. The second photo catches a corner of the transfer packet clipped to the rail: a stamped block that reads **TRANSFER AUTHORIZED — M. KEENE** before a Lanternman shoulder blocks it.

You step out just enough to be seen, palms open, voice flat like you’ve said it a thousand times. “Keene—audit’s here. You want that bay door open or you want them waiting?”

Immediate effect: Keene freezes mid-step. Her eyes flick to the front lot where headlights wash the main entrance, then back to you. For half a breath she looks relieved—like you handed her an excuse—then the relief curdles into suspicion. “Who the hell are you?” she snaps, but she’s already moving: she jabs two fingers toward the bay door control panel to her left, then points at the Lanternmen like she’s directing traffic. “Hold. Two minutes.”

The driver’s hand on the latch stops. Not relaxes—stops. He keeps his fingers hooked under the handle, ready. He looks past you, not at you, like he’s checking for a second set of eyes in the rain. Doc Vellum shifts in close to Keene, voice low but you catch the edge of it over the engines: “If they step into intake, we’re done. Move it.”

Behind you, through the chain-link gap, the front entrance doors open and a pair of municipal types in raincoats start across the lot—clipboards tucked to their chests, one of them already dialing someone, annoyed.

The alley smells like wet diesel and disinfectant leaking from a cracked service vent to the west wall. The pressure is immediate: if Keene opens the bay now, she’s inviting the audit into the back corridors; if she stalls them, she has to explain why.

**Status updates:**  
- Photos secured: plate, toe-tag  
- Keene: stalled transfer, suspicious  
- Audit team: approaching front entrance

### Turn 12 [PLAYER]

I keep my palms up and angle my body so I can still see the driver’s hand. “Mercer—contract compliance. I’m the guy you call when paperwork starts sweating.” I nod toward the front lot. “They’re coming in hot; you do not want them standing at the main desk. Open the bay, bring them through intake—looks clean, feels routine.”

Without waiting for her answer, I step back a half pace and call out toward the approaching raincoats, loud enough to carry: “Audit! Rear intake’s the active door—follow my voice.”

*Agent reasoning: I need the audit team to collide with this transfer while the Lanternmen are stalled, but I can’t let Vellum pin me down or the driver decide I’m a threat. I’ll bluff a harmless role, steer Keene toward opening the bay, and physically position myself to watch the latch/plate while creating a clear line for the auditors to see the gurney if it moves.*

### Turn 13 [GAME]

“Mercer—contract compliance. I’m the guy you call when paperwork starts sweating.”

**Immediate outcome:** Keene buys it—halfway. Not because she believes you, but because your lie gives her a script that keeps the auditors out of her front office and away from whatever’s on the computer terminals.

Rain hisses off the bay’s corrugated awning as she snaps, “Rear intake is *not* an active door—unless I say it is.” Then she swipes her badge at the panel anyway. The loading bay door motor groans and starts to climb, spilling a slice of freezer-cold air and bleach stink into the alley.

You call out, loud, toward the two raincoats crossing the front lot. “Audit! Rear intake’s the active door—follow my voice.”

One of them stops dead, turns his head, and squints through the rain like he’s trying to place your face. The other—shorter, hair tucked under a hood—keeps walking but changes angle, heading toward the service alley with the annoyed, purposeful stride of someone who doesn’t like surprises. The taller one raises his voice back, sharp: “Who authorized rear intake? Identify yourself!”

Keene leans close enough that you catch cigarette-mint on her breath. “If you’re not on my roster, Mercer, you’re about to be my problem.” But she’s already putting on her “routine” voice, louder, for the auditors to hear: “Evening, municipal. We’re staging overflow through rear intake due to a refrigeration service call.”

To your left, the Lanternmen driver’s hand tightens on the van latch—knuckles pale. He doesn’t open it yet. Doc Vellum’s eyes flick from the auditors to you, then to Keene, calculating. He murmurs, just audible: “That wasn’t in the plan, Mara.” His tone says *fix it*.

Inside the rising bay door, fluorescent light reveals a short corridor: yellow mop bucket, a wall-mounted key box, and a security camera above the doorframe pointed straight down the alley—its red status LED steady, recording.

A figure across the street under an awning—shopfront measuring tape around their neck like a lanyard—pauses mid-cigarette and watches the bay open, then steps back inside as if to “get out of the rain.”

**Status updates:**
- Bay door: opening, rear corridor exposed  
- Audit team: rerouting toward alley  
- Lanternmen transfer: paused, tense
