### Turn 4 [PLAYER]

Rika “Grind” Morrow is a disgraced colonial marine who survived the Helix Station blackout and got blamed for the bodies left behind. Now she works as a contracted boarding specialist, breaching derelicts and clearing corridors that still smell like burnt wiring and rot. Hard-edged, hypervigilant, and brutally pragmatic, she carries a simmering resentment toward command and anyone who expects obedience. Her goal is to reach Helix’s sealed core, pull the black-box evidence that clears her name, and make the people who set her up pay—if whatever’s still in there doesn’t find her first.

*Agent reasoning: Generated aggressive-style character for Sci-Fi Horror Survival*

### Turn 5 [GAME]

Here's your character:

**Rika "Grind" Morrow**
*Contracted boarding specialist and breach-clear operative (ex-Colonial Marine)*

Once a decorated colonial marine, Rika survived the Helix Station blackout but became the convenient scapegoat for the dead left in its corridors. Court-martialed on paper and abandoned in practice, she vanished into the contractor underworld, taking jobs no one else wants—derelicts, quarantines, and silent hulks with power still humming behind sealed doors. She keeps a battered Helix-issued wrist tag and a fragmentary audio log that suggests her squad never received the real evacuation orders.

**Traits:** Hard-edged and intimidatingly direct, Hypervigilant, sleep-light, and threat-focused, Brutally pragmatic under pressure, Resentful of command structures and blind obedience, Stubbornly persistent, even self-destructive
**Goal:** Reach Helix Station’s sealed core, recover the black-box evidence that clears her name, and identify—and punish—the people who framed her, before whatever still lingers inside Helix finishes the job.

### Turn 9 [GAME]

Dockside, three hours before breach, Rika Morrow sits alone in a rented locker bay and listens to the station’s name like it can cut her. Helix still lives behind her eyes, and every click in the walls feels like a judge’s gavel.

She tells herself this job is just entry and exit. She doesn’t believe it, because the battered Helix-issued wrist tag in her palm feels warm, like it remembers her pulse.

She runs a whetstone down her boarding knife and keeps the strokes even. Her ex-marine habits do the thinking for her, and her hypervigilance does the rest, counting the footfalls outside and tracking the pause between breaths. She checks her breach charges, then her mag-boots, then the sealed pouch with the fragmentary audio log she never plays all the way through.

A dead channel pings. The comm unit shouldn’t even handshake, not with old Helix encryption, but it does.

The sender tag reads a squadmate’s callsign, listed KIA in the Colonial Administration Inquiry Office database—the office that “investigates” disasters and trades favors in silence. Rika’s stomach locks as the payload auto-decrypts.

Twelve seconds of audio fills the locker bay. It’s her voice, flat and official, issuing an evacuation order she never gave.

She hears the tiny artifacts in the splice, the way the words don’t sit right on her tongue. She watches the timecode under it match the sealed-core black box index, the one Helix Corporate Security uses to bury command logs under “quarantine enforcement.”

Three words flash under the file. CORE STILL LOCKED.

Her wrist tag chirps on its own, trying to authenticate with something that shouldn’t be alive. Outside her door, boots stop, then shift, like someone just got the same alert.

### Turn 10 [PLAYER]

I kill the locker bay lights, palm my boarding knife, and slide to the door’s edge. I snap it open hard and step into their space, blade low. “You stalking me or did Helix just ping you too? Talk—now.”

*Agent reasoning: Someone’s outside and timing matters; I’m not getting cornered in a locker bay. I’ll take initiative, weapon ready, and confront before they make the first move.*

### Turn 11 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** The lights die in your locker bay, and when you snap the door open you catch the person outside flat-footed—close enough that your knife is already in their airspace. They jerk back, hands up, and a compact pistol clatters against the corridor wall as they fumble it instead of drawing clean.

You step into the corridor’s spill-light: bruised violet emergency strips stuttering overhead, condensation beading on the bulkhead. The air tastes like hot dust and antiseptic.

The figure is lean, dockside gear—not corporate armor. A cheap rebreather hangs loose at their throat. Their eyes keep flicking to your left wrist.

“Easy—easy,” they say, voice pitched low. “I’m not HCS. If I was, you’d be zip-tied already.”

They swallow, then nod toward your wrist tag like it’s a live grenade. “Helix pinged me because it pinged *everything* in this block that ever touched Helix auth. You lit up the whole dead-net when your tag chirped. I was tracking the handshake—wanted to see if it was real or a spoof.”

Behind them, down the corridor to the west, a service hatch is half-open—someone’s been using it recently; the screws are finger-loose and the sealant is torn. Past that, faint insectile relay-chatter starts up again, three bursts, then stops, like something listening for your response.

The dockside operative keeps their palms visible, but their gaze keeps measuring distances—your knife, the dropped pistol, the service hatch. “Name’s Sable,” they say quickly. “Reclaimer-side. Broker didn’t tell you the other part, did he? HCS posted a quarantine bulletin an hour ago—‘armed deserter attempting unauthorized entry.’ No face yet, but they’re pushing patrols into the docks. They’re looking for *your* wrist tag signature.”

As if to confirm it, your comm unit ticks once—an automated system scan brushing the channel, not a voice, just a cold ping that feels like a searchlight.

**STATUS UPDATES:**  
- Corridor contact: Reclaimer “Sable”  
- HCS scan ping: active nearby  

```json

```

### Turn 12 [PLAYER]

I hook my boot under the dropped pistol and kick it down the corridor away from both of us. “Sable—either you’re coming or you’re dead weight. That hatch: now.” I grab their collar, shove them toward the half-open service hatch, and slip in right behind them, knife up and eyes on the dark.

*Agent reasoning: HCS is sweeping for my tag; talking is wasting time. I’ll use Sable as cover if useful, grab the dropped pistol, and move through that service hatch before the scan tightens.*

### Turn 13 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Your boot hooks the pistol clean and you whip it down-corridor; it skitters and spins into the strobing violet light, clacking off a bulkhead before disappearing into mist. Sable flinches at the noise—then you’ve got their collar and they’s stumbling toward the half-open service hatch.

The hatch gives way with a wet, reluctant pop as you shoulder it wider.

The world **breathes back**.

A **freezing, sweet-sour fog** punches out of the hatch like a held cough finally released—pressure backwash. It slams into your face and hands, turns your gloves tacky in a heartbeat, and smears the corridor lights into long, bleeding streaks across your vision. Sable chokes and tries to suck their rebreather into place with shaking fingers.

Something small and fast **skitters** in the turbulence—too many taps to be one set of feet—riding the pressure wave out past your boots and into the corridor you just came from.

The relay chatter you heard earlier accelerates instantly, insectile clicks stacking into a rhythm that feels like a heartbeat finding a tempo.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re half-in, half-out of the **service crawl** to the west—ribbed maintenance ducting, damp insulation, and a grated deck slick with condensed mist. Behind you, the locker-bay corridor is now a fogged choke point lit by stuttering emergency strips.

Sable’s voice comes ragged through the rebreather seal. “—backwash—damn it, the seal was holding differential—” They grab your forearm hard, not to fight you, but to keep from falling. “If that fog hits a patrol’s optics, they’ll light this whole block up. And if it’s *contaminated*—” They don’t finish, eyes tracking the swirling haze like it might grow teeth.

Down the corridor behind you, the kicked pistol clacks again—either settling… or being nudged by something you can’t see.

Inside the crawl ahead, deeper darkness folds around a narrow run of manual equalization valves—old brass-handles, labeled in Helix shorthand. One of them is already half-turned, like someone started venting and panicked.

**STATUS UPDATES:**
- Service hatch: seal compromised  
- Visibility: heavily reduced  
- Fog: spreading into corridor  
- Skittering: moved outward
