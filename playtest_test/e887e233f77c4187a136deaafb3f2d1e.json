It’s late—after midnight—when most windows go dark on purpose. Steam leaks from a street grate and smells like old radiator heat and wet brick.\n\nYou stand under the Ashwick’s broken awning with your collar up, keeping still the way you learned as a kid in these halls: watch first, move second. Your thumb rubs the damp **ASHWICK 3B** key tag in your pocket until the stamped letters feel sharp. In your other hand, a small flashlight stays off; you don’t give light away unless you have to. You count the new nails in the boards across the third-floor landing in your head, the same methodical habit you use on surveillance—details that don’t argue back.\n\nThe stairwell door opens behind you without a slam. A man steps out, mid-thirties, Wardens’ Union jacket over dock boots, face shaved too clean for the waterfront. He doesn’t look surprised to see you; that’s what makes your stomach tighten. He keeps his hands visible, palms empty, and speaks low like he’s practiced it. “Mercer. Don’t go upstairs.” He nods toward the boarded corridor. “That key tag—someone paid for it to show up.” Rain ticks off his shoulders as he glances past you at the street, where a sedan sits idling with its lights off. “The Trust has eyes on this building tonight. The Choir’s been asking for you by name. If you open 3B, you’re not just opening a room.”\n\nHe pulls a folded page from his pocket and holds it out without stepping closer: a photocopy of a container manifest with a familiar scrawl—**MERCER / M.**—and, in the margin, **H.T.** circled in red. “Three days after your sister vanished,” he says. “That’s not a coincidence. That’s a handoff.”\n\nThe stairwell above you creaks—one careful step, then another—coming down from the third floor.

Under the awning light you catch a detail: the Union jacket is real, but newer than the boots—like it was issued for a purpose, not earned.\n\nHe swallows once, then gives you half of what you asked for. “Tomas Vell,” he says. He doesn’t offer a hand. “Wardens’ Union. On paper.”\n\nAt your second question his gaze flicks—too quick—to the stairwell door behind him, then back to you. “I’m not Choir,” he says, like it tastes bad. “And I’m not Trust.” He lowers his voice further. “I know about Maren because her name is in a Union ledger page that wasn’t meant to leave the docks. Because someone’s been paying overtime for silence since the week she disappeared. And because I was there the night a container got flagged with **MERCER / M.** and nobody would tell me what was inside.”\n\nThe creak above becomes a soft scrape: something dragged across a step. Then a shoe sole touches down on the landing behind Vell—third floor to second—slow and deliberate. A figure appears in the stairwell’s gloom: raincoat, brimmed hat, face still hidden by the angle and shadow. They stop two steps up, not rushing, like they’re counting bodies and exits.\n\nVell doesn’t turn fully, but his shoulders tighten. “That’s not one of mine,” he mutters.\n\nOutside, the sedan across the street finally gives itself away: the cigarette ember in the driver’s window flares, then dims. A second later the engine note changes—idling to ready—without the headlights coming on.\n\nThe figure in the stairwell speaks, voice flat and close enough to carry. “Mr. Mercer. You’ve got something that doesn’t belong to you.” A pause. “Come upstairs. Alone. We’ll trade.”\n\nVell shifts his weight, edging one boot back toward the street as if he’s deciding whether to vanish or intervene. His eyes stay on you, waiting to see which way you break.  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"Photocopy of container manifest (MERCER / M., H.T. circled)\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Ashwick Tenement Hotel (exterior/entry stairwell)\"],\"npcs_add\":[{\"name\":\"Tomas Vell\",\"faction\":\"Wardens’ Union (on paper)\",\"notes\":\"Claims knowledge of Maren via Union ledger and flagged container\"},{\"name\":\"Unknown raincoat figure\",\"faction\":\"Unknown\",\"notes\":\"Inside stairwell; demands Mercer come upstairs alone to trade\"}]}\n```",

A real one. The girl’s transfer didn’t end at the docks.”\n\nVell keeps his eyes on the stairwell, but his jaw works like he’s chewing something bitter. At your murmur, he gives you the truth in pieces. “Sedan’s not Union,” he whispers. “Union doesn’t sit dark like that. Trust does. Or Trust hires it done.”\n\nAcross the street, the sedan rolls forward a few feet—slow, tires hissing on wet asphalt—then stops again. No headlights. It’s adjusting position, not leaving.\n\nVell continues, voice tight. “They’re here for both. You’re the loose end, but 3B is the hook.” He nods almost imperceptibly toward the boards upstairs. “Whatever’s behind that door—Trust doesn’t want it opened in public, and the Choir doesn’t want it opened at all. If you go up alone, you’re walking into a hallway with one way out.”\n\nIn the stairwell, the raincoat figure shifts their weight. You hear the faint click of something metal against tile—could be a ring, could be a gun body tapping a stair rail. Then a second voice, lower, from somewhere above the raincoat—higher floor or just deeper shadow—says, “He’s stalling.”\n\nThe raincoat figure answers without looking back. “Mr. Mercer. Last time. Upstairs. Alone.”\n\nThe threat is clear now: at least two people in the stairwell, one in view and one above; an unlit sedan repositioning to control the street; and an ultimatum that ends with force if you don’t move.",

Two nights later, a woman from the Glass Choir’s hotline left a message on his office phone without giving her name: *“Maren’s file wasn’t lost. It was sold. Don’t go to the docks.”* The call ends with a freight-horn note that doesn’t match any line on the city schedule.\n\nThis morning, a plain envelope is slid under his door. Inside: a damp key tag stamped **ASHWICK 3B**, a strip of 35mm negatives, and a Wardens’ Union ledger page torn clean from a bound book. The ledger lists a container transfer marked **MERCER / M.** with a date three days after Maren vanished—signed off by someone using the initials **H.T.** in the margin, as if the Trust was watching the books. The negatives show a corridor of old tile and riveted steel—too clean for the Ashwick, too narrow for any subway Elias knows—and a blurry figure in a raincoat carrying a girl with Maren’s hair.\n\nBy noon, Elias notices the city noticing him: a car that idles too long across from his office, a dockhand who stares like he recognizes a ghost, a Choir volunteer asking careful questions about “closure.” Someone wants the key back. Someone else wants Elias to use it.\n\nThe Ashwick’s Room 3B has been boarded for years. Tonight, the nails look new."

When bodies surface, each blames the other—and hires men like Mercer to misdirect the trail.\n\n```json\n{\"factions\":[{\"name\":\"The Harrow Trust\",\"public_front\":\"A philanthropic foundation backing shelters, grants, and urban renewal projects.\",\"hidden_agenda\":\"Quietly acquires condemned property to access and excavate something sealed beneath the old rail tunnels.\"},{\"name\":\"Wardens’ Union\",\"public_front\":\"Dockworkers and freight labor union that claims to keep the waterfront safe and wages fair.\",\"hidden_agenda\":\"Runs smuggling routes and traffics people through the docks, maintaining blackmail ledgers on officials and rivals.\"},{\"name\":\"The Glass Choir\",\"public_front\":\"A small revival church and missing-person support hotline offering counseling and ‘visions.’\",\"hidden_agenda\":\"Collects confessions and secrets from the vulnerable, then brokers disappearances and information to paying clients.\"}]}\n```",

      "Elias Mercer hasn’t slept right since the Ashwick’s basement boiler coughed up a new sound—metal on metal, like a train wheel turning underground. Two nights later, a woman from the Glass Choir’s hotline left a message on his office phone without giving her name: *“Maren’s file wasn’t lost. It was sold. Don’t go to the docks.”* The call ends with a freight-horn note that doesn’t match any line on the city schedule.\n\nThis morning, a plain envelope is slid under his door. Inside: a damp key tag stamped **ASHWICK 3B**, a strip of 35mm negatives, and a Wardens’ Union ledger page torn clean from a bound book. The ledger lists a container transfer marked **MERCER / M.** with a date three days after Maren vanished—signed off by someone using the initials **H.T.** in the margin, as if the Trust was watching the books. The negatives show a corridor of old tile and riveted steel—too clean for the Ashwick, too narrow for any subway Elias knows—and a blurry figure in a raincoat carrying a girl with Maren’s hair.\n\nBy noon, Elias notices the city noticing him: a car that idles too long across from his office, a dockhand who stares like he recognizes a ghost, a Choir volunteer asking careful questions about “closure.” Someone wants the key back. Someone else wants Elias to use it.\n\nThe Ashwick’s Room 3B has been boarded for years. Tonight, the nails look new."

        "content": "Night settles over **Ashwick Tenement Hotel** on Grindle Street, and the rain comes down hard enough to turn the sidewalk into a slick, black mirror. It’s late—after midnight—when most windows go dark on purpose. Steam leaks from a street grate and smells like old radiator heat and wet brick.\n\nYou stand under the Ashwick’s broken awning with your collar up, keeping still the way you learned as a kid in these halls: watch first, move second. Your thumb rubs the damp **ASHWICK 3B** key tag in your pocket until the stamped letters feel sharp. In your other hand, a small flashlight stays off; you don’t give light away unless you have to. You count the new nails in the boards across the third-floor landing in your head, the same methodical habit you use on surveillance—details that don’t argue back.\n\nThe stairwell door opens behind you without a slam. A man steps out, mid-thirties, Wardens’ Union jacket over dock boots, face shaved too clean for the waterfront. He doesn’t look surprised to see you; that’s what makes your stomach tighten. He keeps his hands visible, palms empty, and speaks low like he’s practiced it. “Mercer. Don’t go upstairs.” He nods toward the boarded corridor. “That key tag—someone paid for it to show up.” Rain ticks off his shoulders as he glances past you at the street, where a sedan sits idling with its lights off. “The Trust has eyes on this building tonight. The Choir’s been asking for you by name. If you open 3B, you’re not just opening a room.”\n\nHe pulls a folded page from his pocket and holds it out without stepping closer: a photocopy of a container manifest with a familiar scrawl—**MERCER / M.**—and, in the margin, **H.T.** circled in red. “Three days after your sister vanished,” he says. “That’s not a coincidence. That’s a handoff.”\n\nThe stairwell above you creaks—one careful step, then another—coming down from the third floor. You have the key, the boards are new, and someone is already inside the Ashwick, moving toward you."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "I take the photocopy without breaking eye contact. “Name,” I say to him, then angle my body so I can see the stairwell and the sedan at the same time. In a low voice: “And how do you know about Maren—are you Warden, Trust, or Choir?”"
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The paper is damp at the fold and gritty with dock dust; you take it cleanly and keep your eyes on him. Under the awning light you catch a detail: the Union jacket is real, but newer than the boots—like it was issued for a purpose, not earned.\n\nHe swallows once, then gives you half of what you asked for. “Tomas Vell,” he says. He doesn’t offer a hand. “Wardens’ Union. On paper.”\n\nAt your second question his gaze flicks—too quick—to the stairwell door behind him, then back to you. “I’m not Choir,” he says, like it tastes bad. “And I’m not Trust.” He lowers his voice further. “I know about Maren because her name is in a Union ledger page that wasn’t meant to leave the docks. Because someone’s been paying overtime for silence since the week she disappeared. And because I was there the night a container got flagged with **MERCER / M.** and nobody would tell me what was inside.”\n\nThe creak above becomes a soft scrape: something dragged across a step. Then a shoe sole touches down on the landing behind Vell—third floor to second—slow and deliberate. A figure appears in the stairwell’s gloom: raincoat, brimmed hat, face still hidden by the angle and shadow. They stop two steps up, not rushing, like they’re counting bodies and exits.\n\nVell doesn’t turn fully, but his shoulders tighten. “That’s not one of mine,” he mutters.\n\nOutside, the sedan across the street finally gives itself away: the cigarette ember in the driver’s window flares, then dims. A second later the engine note changes—idling to ready—without the headlights coming on.\n\nThe figure in the stairwell speaks, voice flat and close enough to carry. “Mr. Mercer. You’ve got something that doesn’t belong to you.” A pause. “Come upstairs. Alone. We’ll trade.”\n\nVell shifts his weight, edging one boot back toward the street as if he’s deciding whether to vanish or intervene. His eyes stay on you, waiting to see which way you break.  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"Photocopy of container manifest (MERCER / M., H.T. circled)\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Ashwick Tenement Hotel (exterior/entry stairwell)\"],\"npcs_add\":[{\"name\":\"Tomas Vell\",\"faction\":\"Wardens’ Union (on paper)\",\"notes\":\"Claims knowledge of Maren via Union ledger and flagged container\"},{\"name\":\"Unknown raincoat figure\",\"faction\":\"Unknown\",\"notes\":\"Inside stairwell; demands Mercer come upstairs alone to trade\"}]}\n```"

      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The raincoat figure doesn’t come down another step. They tilt their head slightly, as if listening to your tone more than your words.\n\n“Trade for the key tag,” they answer. “And the negatives. You don’t know what you’re holding.” Their voice is practiced—gender hard to place, city-flat, no wasted syllables. “You come up to the third-floor landing. You hand them over. You get a name. A real one. The girl’s transfer didn’t end at the docks.”\n\nVell keeps his eyes on the stairwell, but his jaw works like he’s chewing something bitter. At your murmur, he gives you the truth in pieces. “Sedan’s not Union,” he whispers. “Union doesn’t sit dark like that. Trust does. Or Trust hires it done.”\n\nAcross the street, the sedan rolls forward a few feet—slow, tires hissing on wet asphalt—then stops again. No headlights. It’s adjusting position, not leaving.\n\nVell continues, voice tight. “They’re here for both. You’re the loose end, but 3B is the hook.” He nods almost imperceptibly toward the boards upstairs. “Whatever’s behind that door—Trust doesn’t want it opened in public, and the Choir doesn’t want it opened at all. If you go up alone, you’re walking into a hallway with one way out.”\n\nIn the stairwell, the raincoat figure shifts their weight. You hear the faint click of something metal against tile—could be a ring, could be a gun body tapping a stair rail. Then a second voice, lower, from somewhere above the raincoat—higher floor or just deeper shadow—says, “He’s stalling.”\n\nThe raincoat figure answers without looking back. “Mr. Mercer. Last time. Upstairs. Alone.”\n\nThe threat is clear now: at least two people in the stairwell, one in view and one above; an unlit sedan repositioning to control the street; and an ultimatum that ends with force if you don’t move."

And if you’re lying to me, tell me now before we both bleed for it.”"
