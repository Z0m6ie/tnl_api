### Turn 4 [PLAYER]

Silas Kearne grew up in the back rooms of a Southside pawnshop, learning early how to read desperation in a man’s eyes. Now he works as a private investigator who specializes in “lost” people and buried secrets the cops don’t want to dig up. Careful, observant, and slow to trust, he weighs every word like it might be evidence. He’s hunting the truth behind his sister’s disappearance, convinced the city’s cleanest hands are the dirtiest.

*Agent reasoning: Generated cautious-style character for Noir Mystery*

### Turn 5 [GAME]

Here's your character:

**Silas Kearne**
*Private Investigator specializing in missing persons and sensitive background inquiries*

Silas grew up in the back rooms of a Southside pawnshop, watching people trade heirlooms and lies for quick cash, and learning how to spot fear before it spoke. After a stint as a process server and an off-the-books skip tracer, he turned private investigator, building a reputation for finding “lost” people and prying up secrets that official channels prefer stay buried. His sister Mara vanished three years ago after taking a temp job tied to City Hall, and every lead he follows seems to point upward into the city’s most respectable circles.

**Traits:** Careful and methodical, Keenly observant, Slow to trust, Dry-witted under pressure, Stubbornly principled
**Goal:** Uncover what happened to his sister Mara and expose the powerful figures he believes orchestrated her disappearance, even if it means burning his remaining connections and becoming the next person who goes missing.

### Turn 9 [GAME]

It’s just after midnight at **Kestrel & Vine Pawn**, the old storefront wedged between a closed laundromat and a payday lender on Southside Avenue. Rain needles the window glass and runs in dirty ribbons down the neon “OPEN” sign. Inside, the air smells like damp cardboard and metal polish, and the bell over the door twitches with every gust.

You stand at the counter where you used to sort watches into trays and learn which stories didn’t match the hands shaking around them. Your notepad is open, pen uncapped, the way you keep it when you’re working a missing-persons lead and don’t want to look like you’re working at all. The temp badge with Mara’s misspelling sits half-hidden under your palm, and you keep your eyes on reflections—display case glass, the dark TV screen—more than on the room itself.

The back-room door opens without the bell. **Rook Danner**, your old boss, steps out in shirtsleeves with a revolver low at his thigh like it’s part of his routine. He’s older, but his hands are steady. Behind him, a kid in a soaked dockworker jacket hovers near the shelves, breathing hard, eyes cutting to the front window. Rook doesn’t ask why you’re here. He slides a small cloth pouch across the counter. It lands with a dull, heavy clink.

“Coins,” he says, voice flat. “They’re back in circulation. Same batch as the last time you came asking about Mara.” The kid swallows and blurts, “Two Giltwake guys are outside—black union coats. They told me to tell you the river man wasn’t an accident. They said if you go to **Harrow Street Station** again, you’ll follow him.”

Rook taps the pouch once. “And Renewal’s people came by this afternoon. Asked for you by name. Like they had a file.”

The bell doesn’t ring, but the shop’s front door handle turns anyway, slow and deliberate. You hear wet boots on the threshold, and Rook raises the revolver an inch.

You have the pouch, the badge, and the locker key in your pocket, and someone is coming in.

### Turn 10 [PLAYER]

I slide the pouch into my coat pocket and take one step sideways to put the glass display case between me and the door, hands open and low. Without looking away from the threshold, I murmur to Rook, “Hold. Let me see who it is before you make noise,” then to the kid: “Union coats—names? Did they say ‘Giltwake’ out loud?”

*Agent reasoning: Someone’s entering and Rook’s already armed; I don’t want a shootout in the open. I need to identify who it is, keep my hands visible, and position for cover while getting quick intel from the kid.*

### Turn 11 [GAME]

The pouch disappears into your coat with a soft drag of cloth on cloth. You sidestep; the glass display case is now a waist-high barrier between you and the door. Your hands stay open, low—nothing to grab, nothing to shoot.

Rook’s jaw tightens, but he listens. The revolver doesn’t rise; it just stays ready, angled down, finger straight along the frame. He shifts half a step so he can see the door and you at once.

The kid wipes rain off his upper lip with the back of his hand, eyes fixed on the threshold like he expects it to bite. “Names—no. Didn’t give names.” His voice cracks, then steadies. “They didn’t say ‘Giltwake’ like a business card. They said ‘the docks,’ and ‘we keep things orderly.’ One of ’em had a ring—anchor with a notch. I seen it before on union boys.”

The door opens inward. A man in a black coat with a dockworker cut steps in, letting the rain follow him. He’s broad through the shoulders, hair plastered back, cheeks raw from wind. No union patch on the chest—just clean wool and the kind of calm that isn’t natural at midnight.

Behind him, in the gap before the door swings shut, you catch the second one: slimmer, hat brim low, staying outside under the awning, watching the street more than the shop.

The one inside doesn’t look at the kid. He looks at the counter, then at you behind the glass. His eyes flick to Rook’s hand and stop there.

“Evening,” he says, polite enough to be a threat. “We’re looking for Silas Kearne. Heard he still drops by old friends when he’s got questions.”

Rook doesn’t answer. The man takes one step further in—slow—hands visible, empty. But his coat hangs heavy on the right side like something’s riding the seam.

You are now face-to-face with one probable Giltwake enforcer inside the shop, and a second acting as lookout just outside the door.

### Turn 12 [PLAYER]

I keep my hands visible and my voice even. “You found him. What do the docks want with me—specifically?” I glance past him toward the awning, then back. “And if this is a friendly chat, your partner can come in out of the rain where I can see him.”

*Agent reasoning: I don’t want a gunfight in Rook’s shop; better to control the conversation, confirm who they are, and keep exits/options open while watching the lookout.*

### Turn 13 [GAME]

The man’s eyes narrow a fraction at “specifically,” like you’ve asked for a receipt he didn’t plan to print. He doesn’t move closer, but his weight settles onto the balls of his feet.

“Docks don’t want trouble,” he says. “Docks want quiet. You’ve been asking about a Renewal temp—your sister. That kind of asking makes people nervous.”

At the mention of Mara, the kid flinches; Rook’s face goes still, the way it does when he’s counting exits.

You angle your gaze past the man toward the awning. The lookout is there—hat brim low, cigarette ember a small orange dot. He doesn’t come in. Instead, he turns his head slightly, like he’s listening to something you can’t hear over the rain. Then he taps ash off the cigarette with a measured flick and keeps watching the street.

Inside, the man gives you a small, humorless smile. “He’s fine where he is. He’s watching for cops and… other problems.”

He slides one hand into his coat—slow enough to look casual, not slow enough to be safe—and pulls out a folded paper. Not a gun. He places it on the glass display case near you, but not within easy snatch range unless you lean forward.

A single line is typed on it, like it came off an office machine:

**STOP DIGGING. BRAMM WAS A WARNING.**

Under it, in pen, a second message:

**Kestrel & Vine isn’t neutral ground anymore. Leave. Alone.**

The man’s other hand stays visible, empty, but his right shoulder remains dipped—whatever’s on that side of his coat is still there.

Rook finally speaks, voice low. “Message delivered. Now get out of my shop.”

The enforcer doesn’t leave yet. He watches you over the case. “We’ll know if you don’t listen, Silas. The city always knows.”

Outside, the lookout shifts his stance, turning slightly toward the doorway—ready to move if this turns loud. The threat is clear: they’re here to intimidate, and they’re armed even if they haven’t shown it.

### Turn 14 [PLAYER]

I lean forward just enough to hook the folded paper with two fingers and draw it to me without lunging, keeping my other hand open. “Bramm’s name doesn’t mean anything to me—yet. Who exactly is nervous: Giltwake, Renewal, or someone at City Hall?” I nod toward the door. “And tell your friend outside to stop listening to ghosts and come in where I can see both your hands.”

*Agent reasoning: They want me rattled and reacting. I need information—who sent them, what “Bramm” ties to—and I don’t want a shootout in Rook’s shop. I’ll de-escalate, pocket the note if I can, and get them talking while keeping eyes on the lookout.*

### Turn 15 [GAME]

You hook the folded paper and draw it to your side of the glass. It comes easy—no sudden grab from him, no flinch. Just that steady stare tracking your fingers like he’s memorizing them.

At “Bramm,” something changes: not fear, not surprise—recognition. His eyes flick once toward Rook, then back to you.

“Doesn’t matter what it means to you,” he says. “It means someone already decided you’re in the same book.”

You press on—Giltwake, Renewal, City Hall—and his jaw works like he’s chewing a nail. He doesn’t answer cleanly. Instead he gives you the kind of half-truth that can’t be pinned down in court.

“People who sign papers get nervous when dockhands start finding bodies,” he says. “People who move cargo get nervous when auditors start counting too close. You’re stepping where both of those meet.”

You nod toward the door, telling him to bring the lookout in.

He turns his head slightly, not fully taking his eyes off you, and lifts two fingers in a small, sharp motion—more command than request.

Outside, the lookout doesn’t come in. He takes one last drag, drops the cigarette into a puddle, and grinds it out with his heel. Then he walks—fast but not running—down the sidewalk to the corner and out of view, like he’s heading to a payphone or a parked car.

The man inside watches him go through the glass for a beat, then looks back at you. The polite mask is thinner now.

“You don’t get to set terms,” he says. “Not tonight.”

His right hand finally comes out of his coat. Not a pistol—yet. A leather sap, short and heavy, hanging loose from his fingers. He doesn’t swing it. He just lets you see it.

Rook’s revolver comes up a few inches, unmistakable now. The kid edges backward into the aisle, trying to make himself small.

The threat is immediate and physical: one armed enforcer inside within a few steps of you, his partner has just peeled off to report or bring more, and Rook is on the edge of turning this into gunfire in a cramped shop.
