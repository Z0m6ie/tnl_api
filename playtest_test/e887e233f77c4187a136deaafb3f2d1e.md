### Turn 4 [PLAYER]

Elias Mercer grew up in the back rooms of a failing tenement hotel, learning early to watch doors, shadows, and people who talked too much. Now a private investigator who specializes in quiet surveillance and missing-person cases, he moves through rain-soaked streets with deliberate patience. Careful, observant, and restrained, he thinks three steps ahead and trusts evidence more than instincts. His goal is to find the sister who vanished years ago—while proving to himself he’s not just another man the city chewed up and forgot.

*Agent reasoning: Generated cautious-style character for Noir Mystery*

### Turn 5 [GAME]

Here's your character:

**Elias Mercer**
*Private investigator specializing in discreet surveillance and missing-person cases*

Elias Mercer was raised in the back rooms of the Ashwick Tenement Hotel, a once-busy flop house that slowly rotted into debt, mold, and quiet violence. He learned to survive by noticing who came and went, what they carried, and which lies sounded rehearsed—skills that followed him into adulthood after his younger sister, Maren, vanished without a trace. Now he works the rain-dark streets of the city with a case file in his pocket and a long memory for faces, convinced someone profited from her disappearance.

**Traits:** Careful, Observant, Patient, Restrained, Methodical
**Goal:** Find his missing sister, Maren, by following evidence wherever it leads—while proving he can outlast the city’s grind without becoming another forgotten casualty.

### Turn 9 [GAME]

Night settles over **Ashwick Tenement Hotel** on Grindle Street, and the rain comes down hard enough to turn the sidewalk into a slick, black mirror. It’s late—after midnight—when most windows go dark on purpose. Steam leaks from a street grate and smells like old radiator heat and wet brick.

You stand under the Ashwick’s broken awning with your collar up, keeping still the way you learned as a kid in these halls: watch first, move second. Your thumb rubs the damp **ASHWICK 3B** key tag in your pocket until the stamped letters feel sharp. In your other hand, a small flashlight stays off; you don’t give light away unless you have to. You count the new nails in the boards across the third-floor landing in your head, the same methodical habit you use on surveillance—details that don’t argue back.

The stairwell door opens behind you without a slam. A man steps out, mid-thirties, Wardens’ Union jacket over dock boots, face shaved too clean for the waterfront. He doesn’t look surprised to see you; that’s what makes your stomach tighten. He keeps his hands visible, palms empty, and speaks low like he’s practiced it. “Mercer. Don’t go upstairs.” He nods toward the boarded corridor. “That key tag—someone paid for it to show up.” Rain ticks off his shoulders as he glances past you at the street, where a sedan sits idling with its lights off. “The Trust has eyes on this building tonight. The Choir’s been asking for you by name. If you open 3B, you’re not just opening a room.”

He pulls a folded page from his pocket and holds it out without stepping closer: a photocopy of a container manifest with a familiar scrawl—**MERCER / M.**—and, in the margin, **H.T.** circled in red. “Three days after your sister vanished,” he says. “That’s not a coincidence. That’s a handoff.”

The stairwell above you creaks—one careful step, then another—coming down from the third floor. You have the key, the boards are new, and someone is already inside the Ashwick, moving toward you.

### Turn 10 [PLAYER]

I take the photocopy without breaking eye contact. “Name,” I say to him, then angle my body so I can see the stairwell and the sedan at the same time. In a low voice: “And how do you know about Maren—are you Warden, Trust, or Choir?”

*Agent reasoning: Someone’s coming down the stairs and there’s a car outside—getting boxed in is the fastest way to die. I need the paper, the man’s name, and a better position with exits while I assess who’s approaching.*

### Turn 11 [GAME]

The paper is damp at the fold and gritty with dock dust; you take it cleanly and keep your eyes on him. Under the awning light you catch a detail: the Union jacket is real, but newer than the boots—like it was issued for a purpose, not earned.

He swallows once, then gives you half of what you asked for. “Tomas Vell,” he says. He doesn’t offer a hand. “Wardens’ Union. On paper.”

At your second question his gaze flicks—too quick—to the stairwell door behind him, then back to you. “I’m not Choir,” he says, like it tastes bad. “And I’m not Trust.” He lowers his voice further. “I know about Maren because her name is in a Union ledger page that wasn’t meant to leave the docks. Because someone’s been paying overtime for silence since the week she disappeared. And because I was there the night a container got flagged with **MERCER / M.** and nobody would tell me what was inside.”

The creak above becomes a soft scrape: something dragged across a step. Then a shoe sole touches down on the landing behind Vell—third floor to second—slow and deliberate. A figure appears in the stairwell’s gloom: raincoat, brimmed hat, face still hidden by the angle and shadow. They stop two steps up, not rushing, like they’re counting bodies and exits.

Vell doesn’t turn fully, but his shoulders tighten. “That’s not one of mine,” he mutters.

Outside, the sedan across the street finally gives itself away: the cigarette ember in the driver’s window flares, then dims. A second later the engine note changes—idling to ready—without the headlights coming on.

The figure in the stairwell speaks, voice flat and close enough to carry. “Mr. Mercer. You’ve got something that doesn’t belong to you.” A pause. “Come upstairs. Alone. We’ll trade.”

Vell shifts his weight, edging one boot back toward the street as if he’s deciding whether to vanish or intervene. His eyes stay on you, waiting to see which way you break.

```

### Turn 12 [PLAYER]

I keep my feet planted and don’t reach for the key. “Trade for what?” I call up to the raincoat, calm. Then, without looking away from the stairs, I murmur to Vell: “If that sedan moves, tell me now—are they here for me, or for what’s behind 3B?”

*Agent reasoning: Going upstairs alone is a trap, and there’s a car ready to move—likely a snatch. I need to stall, learn what they want, and keep an exit while gauging if Vell is an ally or another hook.*

### Turn 13 [GAME]

The raincoat figure doesn’t come down another step. They tilt their head slightly, as if listening to your tone more than your words.

“Trade for the key tag,” they answer. “And the negatives. You don’t know what you’re holding.” Their voice is practiced—gender hard to place, city-flat, no wasted syllables. “You come up to the third-floor landing. You hand them over. You get a name. A real one. The girl’s transfer didn’t end at the docks.”

Vell keeps his eyes on the stairwell, but his jaw works like he’s chewing something bitter. At your murmur, he gives you the truth in pieces. “Sedan’s not Union,” he whispers. “Union doesn’t sit dark like that. Trust does. Or Trust hires it done.”

Across the street, the sedan rolls forward a few feet—slow, tires hissing on wet asphalt—then stops again. No headlights. It’s adjusting position, not leaving.

Vell continues, voice tight. “They’re here for both. You’re the loose end, but 3B is the hook.” He nods almost imperceptibly toward the boards upstairs. “Whatever’s behind that door—Trust doesn’t want it opened in public, and the Choir doesn’t want it opened at all. If you go up alone, you’re walking into a hallway with one way out.”

In the stairwell, the raincoat figure shifts their weight. You hear the faint click of something metal against tile—could be a ring, could be a gun body tapping a stair rail. Then a second voice, lower, from somewhere above the raincoat—higher floor or just deeper shadow—says, “He’s stalling.”

The raincoat figure answers without looking back. “Mr. Mercer. Last time. Upstairs. Alone.”

The threat is clear now: at least two people in the stairwell, one in view and one above; an unlit sedan repositioning to control the street; and an ultimatum that ends with force if you don’t move.

### Turn 14 [PLAYER]

I back a step into the rain and away from the stairwell mouth, putting the awning post between me and the stairs. “No,” I call up. “You want a trade, you bring the name down here—where your friend and that sedan can’t pretend they’re not part of it.”  

Without looking away, I murmur to Vell, “Can you get me a plate or a make on that driver? And if you’re lying to me, tell me now before we both bleed for it.”

*Agent reasoning: “Alone” is a setup, and they’re already in position. I need distance, cover, and a way to learn more without stepping into that stairwell kill-box; Vell might be a usable distraction or ally.*
