### Turn 4 [PLAYER]

Elias “Eli” Marrow grew up in the back rooms of a failing pawnshop, learning early how to read people by what they’re willing to sell. A methodical private investigator, he tails suspects with patience instead of bravado, noting the small tells others miss. Careful, observant, and quietly stubborn, he thinks three moves ahead and speaks only when it counts. He’s driven to expose the crooked patron who ruined his family, even if it means digging up dirt that the city would rather keep buried.

*Agent reasoning: Generated cautious-style character for Noir Mystery*

### Turn 5 [GAME]

Here's your character:

**Elias "Eli" Marrow**
*Methodical private investigator*

Eli grew up in the cramped back rooms of his family’s failing pawnshop, where he learned to read desperation, lies, and leverage from the objects people were willing to part with. After a well-dressed patron engineered the shop’s collapse through quiet debt and dirty favors, Eli took to the streets with a notebook and a cheap camera, training himself to notice what others overlook. Now he works cases in the city’s dim margins, following paper trails and people with the same steady patience he once used to appraise tarnished goods.

**Traits:** Observant, Patient, Quietly stubborn, Strategic, Cautious
**Goal:** Unmask and bring down the crooked patron who ruined his family by uncovering the buried corruption tying them to the city’s power structure, even if it puts Eli in the crosshairs of people who prefer secrets to stay lost.

### Turn 9 [GAME]

You shoulder through the City Hall side entrance as a janitor’s cart rolls toward you, wheels squealing on wet tile. A uniformed guard barks at someone behind you, and you don’t look back. Your cheap camera bumps your ribs with each step. Ahead, a door swings shut—Records—and you catch the last slice of light before the latch clicks. You slide a hand under your coat and feel paper edges: the torn appointment card, damp with sweat.

This is City Hall, third floor, where clerks and judges turn neighborhoods into numbers. You’re Elias Marrow—Eli to the few who still bother—private investigator with a notebook full of dates and a habit of watching hands instead of faces. The pawnshop stamp on that old ticket still shows in your mind like an ink bruise. You’re here because your name is on a Saint Brigid Trust report you never touched, and because paper is the only thing in this city that doesn’t forget.

A woman steps out of a stairwell and cuts you off hard enough that you nearly collide. She’s in a nurse’s coat under a soaked overcoat, hair pinned up like she did it in the dark. She grabs your sleeve, nails digging through wool. “They’re moving the ledger,” she says, breathless. “Saint Brigid Trust—the charity that runs the clinics—sent men to ‘secure’ Records. Halcyon Civic League—the civic group with the soup lines and the judges—has their security detail on this floor.” She forces something into your palm: a brass key tagged ROOM 3B-12, and a donor code scribbled on the back of a ward receipt. “The clerk who took it? They found his satchel. Empty. Dockside Brotherhood—the dock union that sells muscle—has spotters downstairs. They’re telling people you stole it. If you don’t get to 3B-12 before the hearing clerks do, they’ll bury the names and hang you with the theft.”

Her grip loosens. Behind you, footsteps settle into a steady pace, not rushing—closing. The Records door down the hall opens a fraction, and you see a man’s hand, clean and gloved, testing the latch like he owns it.

You’re in the corridor between the hearing offices and Records, key in hand, with three factions converging on the same paper trail and your name already written on the blame. The next door that opens decides whether you walk out of City Hall or disappear inside it.

### Turn 10 [PLAYER]

I keep the key palmed and step in close to the nurse like we’re arguing quietly. “Room 3B-12—what is it, and what’s your name?” Without turning around, I angle my camera at waist level and snap a blind shot down the corridor toward the approaching footsteps, then start moving—steady, not running—toward 3B-12 while watching reflections in door glass for whoever’s behind me.

*Agent reasoning: I’m getting boxed in—need to buy seconds, confirm the nurse’s credibility, and avoid walking straight into whoever’s on Records. 3B-12 sounds like the objective, but I want eyes on my tail and an exit plan.*

### Turn 11 [GAME]



### Turn 12 [PLAYER]

I stay close to the nurse like we’re mid-argument. “Room 3B-12—what is it, and what’s your name?” I keep the key palmed, snap a low blind photo down the hall, then walk—no rush—toward 3B-12, checking the door-glass reflections for whoever’s closing in.

*Agent reasoning: I need the nurse’s credibility and the room’s purpose fast, and I need a record of who’s tailing me without escalating by running.*

### Turn 13 [GAME]

The nurse plays along the instant you lean in—chin up, eyes hard, like you’ve just said something unforgivable. “Room 3B-12 is a clerk’s interview room,” she murmurs through clenched teeth, loud enough to sell the argument to anyone listening. “Used for ‘renewal’ tenants. Used for… adjustments.” Her gaze flicks to your palmed key. “Name’s Lorna. Lorna Vess. I’m not supposed to be here.”

You keep your body between her and the corridor and snap the blind shot at waist level.

The camera’s shutter gives a soft, traitorous click in the hush. In the door-glass reflection to your right—warped by old wavy panes—you catch the shape behind you: a man in a neat dark coat, hat brim low, gloved hands. He isn’t hurrying. He’s matching your pace like he’s got all night and paperwork on his side.

As you start your steady walk toward 3B-12, Lorna drifts with you for three steps, still “arguing.” “Halcyon’s security are on this floor,” she says, lips barely moving. “If they stop you, don’t show the key. Say you’re here for a hearing file pull—Clerk Durn’s desk. And—Eli—” she swallows when she says your name, like it tastes dangerous, “Saint Brigid’s men are looking for someone to pin this on. They already picked you.”

Down the hall, a pair of City Hall clerks emerge from an office with a tied bundle of folders and a red wax seal; they pause, noticing the nurse and you, then keep going faster than they mean to. Near Records, the door that was cracked earlier eases shut again—careful, controlled—like someone inside just decided to wait.

You reach the section marker: **3B** stenciled on the wall. The corridor narrows here; the air smells of wet wool and old carbon paper. Ahead, **3B-12** sits with a frosted-glass panel and a brass lock that matches the key tag in your palm.

Behind you, the gloved man’s reflection grows larger in the glass as he closes the distance—still not running.
