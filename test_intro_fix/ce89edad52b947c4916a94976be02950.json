Under his office door: a damp envelope that smells faintly of coal tar and chapel incense. Inside, a single Civic Virtue League ration chit stamped with **TONIGHT—CURFEW ESCORT**, and a torn strip of crate-manifest paper with **PIER NINE / SEAL: VEYLAN** half-legible beneath a smear of ink. On the back, in a careful hand he’s seen only once before—his sister’s, from an old postcard—two words: **“DRY DROWN.”**\n\nBy noon, the Harbor Union Council’s “safety men” are prowling the tenements asking after anyone who used to chase missing girls with a notebook and too much patience. Someone has told them Crowe is “sitting on the ledger,” and they’re offering protection with one hand and a river-weighted warning with the other. Across town, the Civic Virtue League posts fresh notices about expanded escort routes; the names of three vanished youths appear in the margins of a shelter intake book—written in pencil, then aggressively erased. A volunteer who recognizes Crowe slips him the address of a chapel side door and begs him not to let the League “reassign” her.\n\nAfter dark, a Veylan runner in a clean coat waits near Crowe’s stairwell, pretending to smoke. He doesn’t threaten—he offers. A paid retainer, access to Pier Nine records, and one quiet question: *What did you find in that envelope?*\n\nSomewhere in the city is a missing ledger, a shipment that shouldn’t exist, and a message that uses his sister’s hand like a knife. Crowe can feel the machinery notice him—gears turning, routes shifting—because someone expects him to move."

      "Elias Crowe wakes to a knock that isn’t a client’s knock—three light taps, a pause, then two like someone counting breaths. Under his office door: a damp envelope that smells faintly of coal tar and chapel incense. Inside, a single Civic Virtue League ration chit stamped with **TONIGHT—CURFEW ESCORT**, and a torn strip of crate-manifest paper with **PIER NINE / SEAL: VEYLAN** half-legible beneath a smear of ink. On the back, in a careful hand he’s seen only once before—his sister’s, from an old postcard—two words: **“DRY DROWN.”**\n\nBy noon, the Harbor Union Council’s “safety men” are prowling the tenements asking after anyone who used to chase missing girls with a notebook and too much patience. Someone has told them Crowe is “sitting on the ledger,” and they’re offering protection with one hand and a river-weighted warning with the other. Across town, the Civic Virtue League posts fresh notices about expanded escort routes; the names of three vanished youths appear in the margins of a shelter intake book—written in pencil, then aggressively erased. A volunteer who recognizes Crowe slips him the address of a chapel side door and begs him not to let the League “reassign” her.\n\nAfter dark, a Veylan runner in a clean coat waits near Crowe’s stairwell, pretending to smoke. He doesn’t threaten—he offers. A paid retainer, access to Pier Nine records, and one quiet question: *What did you find in that envelope?*\n\nSomewhere in the city is a missing ledger, a shipment that shouldn’t exist, and a message that uses his sister’s hand like a knife. Crowe can feel the machinery notice him—gears turning, routes shifting—because someone expects him to move."

        "content": "You wake before the alarm because you always do when the city starts moving wrong. The rain on the window sounds like fingers testing a lock. You lie still on the narrow bed above your office and count the gaps between factory whistles, like you used to count the days after your sister vanished. You want proof, not a story. You want a name that can’t duck behind a committee vote or a charity banner. Wanting doesn’t help. Paper does.\n\nDownstairs, your office smells of damp wool and old paste. You boil water on the hot plate and lay out yesterday’s notes in a straight line: three addresses, two false ones, one that might hold. Your wall of clippings gets a new pin, placed by habit, not hope. You check the lock on the file cabinet, then the window latch, then the revolver in the desk drawer. You don’t trust the night to stay outside.\n\nThe knock comes while you’re rinsing the cup—three light taps, a pause, then two like someone counting breaths. You don’t move at first. No one who needs help knocks like that. You cross the room without turning on the overhead light and listen to the hallway. Nothing but water in the gutters and a distant trolley. When you open the door, the corridor is empty. On the floor sits a damp envelope, edges dark with rain. It smells faintly of coal tar and chapel incense. Inside is a Civic Virtue League ration chit stamped **TONIGHT—CURFEW ESCORT**, and a torn strip of crate-manifest paper: **PIER NINE / SEAL: VEYLAN**, smeared but readable. On the back, in a careful hand you have not seen since an old postcard, are two words: **DRY DROWN.** Your throat tightens. Your sister’s handwriting should be in a box, not on your doorstep.\n\nYou set the papers on your desk and keep your hands flat beside them so you don’t crumple anything. Someone knows where you live. Someone wants you to move, and they’re using her to do it. You can ignore it and stay alive longer, or you can follow it and find out who learned her hand well enough to cut with it."
