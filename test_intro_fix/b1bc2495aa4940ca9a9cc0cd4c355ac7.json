Immediately after, your external mics flood with a thin, wet scrape like fingertips dragging across frost. The waveform spikes in a way that doesn’t match vibration; it’s *air-borne*—meaning something is moving in the narrow gap between your ship and the Hymn’s collar.\n\nYour suit HUD flashes a warning: **OPEN-BAND TRANSMIT DETECTED**—your “Show yourself” jumped channels for a fraction of a second despite your emitter kill. Something in your comm stack “helped.”\n\nJuno’s tightbeam cuts in, voice suddenly sharp. “Mara—don’t—” and then the tightbeam *stutters* like it’s being stepped on from the inside. “—don’t answer it. Don’t—” The rest dissolves into a soft hiss.\n\nYou snap the *Latchkey* in, clamp, and the docking latches bite with a heavy, satisfying thunk. The moment the hard seal forms, the Hymn’s emergency strips on the far side of the collar flicker in a heartbeat rhythm—three pulses, a pause, three pulses.\n\nYou cycle the airlock.\n\nPressure equalizes too fast. Not explosive, but wrong—your ears pop inside the helmet and your suit’s seal integrity ticks yellow for a beat before stabilizing. The inner door unlocks with a reluctant clack, like it had to be convinced.\n\nWhen it swings open, you’re staring into the Hymn’s docking corridor: grated deck, amber strips pulsing, dust drifting like ash.\n\nAnd there’s something else.\n\nA smear of fresh condensation on the left bulkhead—hand-shaped, five long streaks—forming as you watch, as if something just pressed there from the other side of the metal and is pulling away. No body. No silhouette. Just the wet print, sliding downward in slow motion.\n\nBehind you, from the *Latchkey*’s side of the airlock, comes one soft impact—single tap—against your ship’s hull, like a punctuation mark.\n\nYour rifle is up.

Sparks skitter off the metal. The grating rings like a gong. Two rounds punch through something deeper—hollow space—kicking up a puff of rust and old insulation dust. There’s no blood. No meat-splash.

      "Cold metal sweats in the dark, beading along bulkheads like the ship is breathing through its skin. Emergency strips pulse a sick amber, strobed by drifting dust that looks too much like ash. Every sound carries—boot soles on grated deck, the distant tick of cooling pipes, a low hull-groan that rises and falls like a throat clearing. The air tastes of old ozone and burnt plastic under a film of machine oil; when you inhale, it feels used. Somewhere deep, something taps—three soft impacts—then stops, as if listening back. Static crawls through comm speakers with a wet whisper, and the corridor ahead smells faintly of salt and copper.",
      "In the outer lanes, power wears a clean badge and a dirty glove. **HelixKline Interstellar** sells “hazard mitigation” and salvage arbitration, underwriting rescue beacons while quietly buying wrecks that should never be found. Opposing them, the **Colonial Security Directorate** claims to protect shipping with lawful inspections, but runs erased black-site raids and hunts loose evidence like Mara. Between them drift the **Gutterlight Salvagers’ Union**, a ragged mutual-aid network that “keeps crews alive” with contracts and safe docks—yet traffics in forbidden flight recorders and maps of dead ships.

      "Mara Vance is three jumps out of CSD space when the **Sable Hymn** “rescue” beacon lights up—old format, obsolete checksum, and a cadence that makes her teeth ache. Not the distress tone. The *other* one. The one that lived under her squad’s screams in a black-site corridor that officially never existed.\n\nJuno Rake (Gutterlight Union) pings her through a tightbeam relay: a **sealed flight recorder** is rumored aboard the Hymn, still locked in a heat-scored crash cradle. Juno offers a falsified transponder and a cut big enough to re-arm for a year. The catch is time—**HelixKline** arbitration teams are already drafting a quarantine claim, and the **CSD Valiant** has declared **Operation Clean Ledger**, stopping anything that burns propellant near the hulk. If Mara is scanned, she won’t be arrested; she’ll be *processed*.\n\nOn approach, her comms pick up the **three soft impacts**—tap, tap, tap—coming through *metal*, not speakers. A second later, the Hymn’s emergency strips flicker in rhythmic bursts that match the taps like a heartbeat trying to remember a body. Her suit logs register a phantom handshake: an encrypted ping using a key that should have died with her squad.\n\nMara has leverage and liability in the same breath: someone wants that recorder, someone wants her silence, and something inside the wreck seems to recognize her presence—waiting to see if she answers back."

Ahead, the derelict **Sable Hymn** hangs black and huge.\n\n**CHARACTER IN SCENE**  \nYou run your pre-boarding checks like you were trained to. Mag-boots. Cutter charge. Two spare seals. Rifle locked, chamber flagged, then unflagged. Your hands don’t shake. They don’t have the luxury. You angle the *Latchkey*’s thrusters to keep your approach cold and quiet, minimizing burn to dodge long-range scans.\n\n**THE HOOK**  \nThe Hymn’s “rescue” beacon keeps pulsing—old format, wrong checksum, and a cadence that makes your jaw tighten. Not distress. Something else. Your tightbeam relay clicks and **Juno Rake** slides into your headset, voice thin and controlled. Union broker. Dirty contacts. “Recorder’s real,” Juno says. “Sealed. Crash cradle. Heat-scored but intact. You pull it, you get paid. I’m sending you a falsified transponder now.”  \nA second voice cuts in over open-band static—flat, official, too clean. **CSD Valiant**. “Operation Clean Ledger in effect. All vessels reduce thrust and prepare for inspection.” The words aren’t a threat. They’re a trap with paperwork. If they board you, you won’t be arrested. You’ll be erased.  \nThen you hear it. Not through speakers. Through the ship’s frame. Three soft impacts—tap, tap, tap—like knuckles on a bulkhead. Your console flickers in time with it. Your suit log pings an encrypted handshake request using a key that should be dead.\n\n**THE MOMENT**  \nThe falsified transponder arrives. The Valiant’s scan beam sweeps closer. The Hymn’s docking collar drifts into alignment, waiting. Tap, tap, tap—again, nearer. Your comm cursor hovers over **ACCEPT** as your ship’s hull answers with a faint, involuntary creak."

Three soft impacts answering from *outside* your hull, close to the starboard airlock ring. Tap. Tap. Tap. Immediately after, your external mics flood with a thin, wet scrape like fingertips dragging across frost. The waveform spikes in a way that doesn’t match vibration; it’s *air-borne*—meaning something is moving in the narrow gap between your ship and the Hymn’s collar.\n\nYour suit HUD flashes a warning: **OPEN-BAND TRANSMIT DETECTED**—your “Show yourself” jumped channels for a fraction of a second despite your emitter kill. Something in your comm stack “helped.”\n\nJuno’s tightbeam cuts in, voice suddenly sharp. “Mara—don’t—” and then the tightbeam *stutters* like it’s being stepped on from the inside. “—don’t answer it. Don’t—” The rest dissolves into a soft hiss.\n\nYou snap the *Latchkey* in, clamp, and the docking latches bite with a heavy, satisfying thunk. The moment the hard seal forms, the Hymn’s emergency strips on the far side of the collar flicker in a heartbeat rhythm—three pulses, a pause, three pulses.\n\nYou cycle the airlock.\n\nPressure equalizes too fast. Not explosive, but wrong—your ears pop inside the helmet and your suit’s seal integrity ticks yellow for a beat before stabilizing. The inner door unlocks with a reluctant clack, like it had to be convinced.\n\nWhen it swings open, you’re staring into the Hymn’s docking corridor: grated deck, amber strips pulsing, dust drifting like ash.\n\nAnd there’s something else.\n\nA smear of fresh condensation on the left bulkhead—hand-shaped, five long streaks—forming as you watch, as if something just pressed there from the other side of the metal and is pulling away. No body. No silhouette. Just the wet print, sliding downward in slow motion.\n\nBehind you, from the *Latchkey*’s side of the airlock, comes one soft impact—single tap—against your ship’s hull, like a punctuation mark.\n\nYour rifle is up. The corridor ahead is empty, but the tapping is now on both sides of the threshold.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Latchkey airlock (docked to Sable Hymn)\",\"Sable Hymn docking corridor\"],\"npcs_add\":[\"Juno Rake (tightbeam contact)\"]}\n```"

What the hell is ‘it’ and how do I kill it?”"

It shudders as if something is holding it on the track. Your panel flashes **OBSTRUCTION / MANUAL OVERRIDE REQUIRED**.\n\nFrom the gap, a thin ribbon of cold fog spills inward, crawling along the deck plates against the airflow like it has weight and intent.\n\nYou lean out and fire a short, disciplined burst.\n\nRounds hammer the Hymn’s deck grating and the left bulkhead where the condensation handprint is sliding. Sparks skitter off the metal. The grating rings like a gong. Two rounds punch through something deeper—hollow space—kicking up a puff of rust and old insulation dust. There’s no blood. No meat-splash. But the condensation reacts: the hand-shape *jerks* as if flinching, smearing into a long drag-mark… and then it reforms, five streaks again, higher up the bulkhead, like it “stepped” without a body.\n\nYour suit audio spikes: a close, wet inhale that isn’t yours, right at the edge of the open door gap. The door shudders harder. The obstruction isn’t physical in the usual way—no visible limb, no tool—just resistance, like trying to close on a pressure differential that shouldn’t exist.\n\nYou key Juno. Tightbeam tries to lock and fails twice. On the third attempt you get a broken thread of voice, layered with another signal under it—your old squad encryption key, ghosting the packet.\n\n“—Mara, listen—” Juno says, breathy, scared. “It’s the *three-tap*. It rides open comms and structure. You—” A burst of static. Then, clearer but not Juno’s cadence, a voiceprint that makes your teeth ache: **“Vance.”**\n\nThe corridor lights answer with three amber pulses.\n\nAnd now the tapping is inside the airlock with you: tap, tap, tap—coming from the *inner* faceplate of your helmet, like someone knocking from the wrong side of the glass."
