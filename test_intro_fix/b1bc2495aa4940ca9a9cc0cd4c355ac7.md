### Turn 4 [PLAYER]

Mara Vance is a disgraced colonial marine who survived a black-site boarding action that everyone else officially “forgot.” Now working as a salvage security contractor, she’s combat-ready, sharp-eyed, and relentlessly stubborn, with a simmering resentment toward command and anyone who talks like a suit. She trusts her rifle more than people and meets every problem head-on, even when it’s smarter to run. Her goal is to recover the sealed flight recorder from that lost op—before whatever hunted her crew finds her again.

*Agent reasoning: Generated aggressive-style character for Sci-Fi Horror Survival*

### Turn 5 [GAME]

Here's your character:

**Mara Vance**
*Salvage Security Contractor (ex-Colonial Marine)*

Once a decorated colonial marine, Mara was the lone survivor of a classified black-site boarding action that was erased from official records and pinned on her as a catastrophic failure. Discharged in disgrace and hounded by quiet threats whenever she asks questions, she now takes off-the-books salvage protection jobs to stay armed, mobile, and out of reach. The incident left her with a hair-trigger vigilance and a private certainty that what killed her squad wasn’t human—and it remembers her.

**Traits:** Combat-ready and disciplined under fire, Sharp-eyed and hypervigilant, Relentlessly stubborn, Deeply distrustful of authority and corporate "suits", Confrontational courage that borders on reckless
**Goal:** Recover the sealed flight recorder from the erased boarding action to expose what really happened—before the same presence that hunted her crew tracks her down and finishes the job.

### Turn 9 [GAME]

**PLACE & TIME**  
You’re in the cramped cockpit of the *Latchkey*, tucked behind a dead comm buoy in the outer lanes. Shiptime reads 02:17—deep night, no sun-glare, just instrument glow. Condensation beads on the canopy frame. The air smells like old ozone and gun oil. Ahead, the derelict **Sable Hymn** hangs black and huge.

**CHARACTER IN SCENE**  
You run your pre-boarding checks like you were trained to. Mag-boots. Cutter charge. Two spare seals. Rifle locked, chamber flagged, then unflagged. Your hands don’t shake. They don’t have the luxury. You angle the *Latchkey*’s thrusters to keep your approach cold and quiet, minimizing burn to dodge long-range scans.

**THE HOOK**  
The Hymn’s “rescue” beacon keeps pulsing—old format, wrong checksum, and a cadence that makes your jaw tighten. Not distress. Something else. Your tightbeam relay clicks and **Juno Rake** slides into your headset, voice thin and controlled. Union broker. Dirty contacts. “Recorder’s real,” Juno says. “Sealed. Crash cradle. Heat-scored but intact. You pull it, you get paid. I’m sending you a falsified transponder now.”  
A second voice cuts in over open-band static—flat, official, too clean. **CSD Valiant**. “Operation Clean Ledger in effect. All vessels reduce thrust and prepare for inspection.” The words aren’t a threat. They’re a trap with paperwork. If they board you, you won’t be arrested. You’ll be erased.  
Then you hear it. Not through speakers. Through the ship’s frame. Three soft impacts—tap, tap, tap—like knuckles on a bulkhead. Your console flickers in time with it. Your suit log pings an encrypted handshake request using a key that should be dead.

**THE MOMENT**  
The falsified transponder arrives. The Valiant’s scan beam sweeps closer. The Hymn’s docking collar drifts into alignment, waiting. Tap, tap, tap—again, nearer. Your comm cursor hovers over **ACCEPT** as your ship’s hull answers with a faint, involuntary creak.

### Turn 10 [PLAYER]

I slam **ACCEPT** on Juno’s falsified transponder and kill every nonessential emitter. “Juno, shut up and stay tightbeam—if that key pings again, I’m ripping the comm stack out.” I roll the *Latchkey* hard and burn just enough to slip into the **Sable Hymn’s** hull shadow, lining up for docking while I bring the rifle up and sweep the canopy and suit sensors for whatever’s tapping my ship.

*Agent reasoning: If the Valiant boards me, I’m done. I need to disappear fast—get under the Hymn’s shadow, take the fake transponder, and I’m not answering any ghost-handshake.*

### Turn 11 [GAME]



### Turn 12 [PLAYER]

I key my suit’s external mics to max gain and thump the bulkhead back with my boot—hard. “Show yourself.” Then I snap the *Latchkey* onto the Hymn’s collar, clamp, and cycle the airlock with rifle shouldered, ready to light up anything that moved.

*Agent reasoning: No feedback means something’s wrong—either comms jammed or the thing is already on me. I’m not sitting in open space waiting to get inspected; I’m docking and clearing the immediate threat first.*

### Turn 13 [GAME]

Your boot hits the *Latchkey*’s inner bulkhead with a dull clang that you feel up your tibia.

For half a second: nothing.

Then the sound comes back—not through your speakers, through the metal. Three soft impacts answering from *outside* your hull, close to the starboard airlock ring. Tap. Tap. Tap. Immediately after, your external mics flood with a thin, wet scrape like fingertips dragging across frost. The waveform spikes in a way that doesn’t match vibration; it’s *air-borne*—meaning something is moving in the narrow gap between your ship and the Hymn’s collar.

Your suit HUD flashes a warning: **OPEN-BAND TRANSMIT DETECTED**—your “Show yourself” jumped channels for a fraction of a second despite your emitter kill. Something in your comm stack “helped.”

Juno’s tightbeam cuts in, voice suddenly sharp. “Mara—don’t—” and then the tightbeam *stutters* like it’s being stepped on from the inside. “—don’t answer it. Don’t—” The rest dissolves into a soft hiss.

You snap the *Latchkey* in, clamp, and the docking latches bite with a heavy, satisfying thunk. The moment the hard seal forms, the Hymn’s emergency strips on the far side of the collar flicker in a heartbeat rhythm—three pulses, a pause, three pulses.

You cycle the airlock.

Pressure equalizes too fast. Not explosive, but wrong—your ears pop inside the helmet and your suit’s seal integrity ticks yellow for a beat before stabilizing. The inner door unlocks with a reluctant clack, like it had to be convinced.

When it swings open, you’re staring into the Hymn’s docking corridor: grated deck, amber strips pulsing, dust drifting like ash.

And there’s something else.

A smear of fresh condensation on the left bulkhead—hand-shaped, five long streaks—forming as you watch, as if something just pressed there from the other side of the metal and is pulling away. No body. No silhouette. Just the wet print, sliding downward in slow motion.

Behind you, from the *Latchkey*’s side of the airlock, comes one soft impact—single tap—against your ship’s hull, like a punctuation mark.

Your rifle is up. The corridor ahead is empty, but the tapping is now on both sides of the threshold.

```

### Turn 14 [PLAYER]

I back up a half-step into the airlock, rifle trained down the corridor, and slam the *Latchkey* side door control to **CLOSE**—I’m not letting anything slip in behind me. Then I lean out and fire a short burst into the deck grating and bulkhead where that condensation handprint is sliding, watching for splash, sparks, anything. “Juno—talk. What the hell is ‘it’ and how do I kill it?”

*Agent reasoning: Something’s in the gap and it’s messing with comms; I’m not letting it trap me in the threshold. I need hard intel fast and a fallback route.*

### Turn 15 [GAME]

The *Latchkey* side door control chirps and the outer airlock door starts to slide—then stops three centimeters short of fully shut. It shudders as if something is holding it on the track. Your panel flashes **OBSTRUCTION / MANUAL OVERRIDE REQUIRED**.

From the gap, a thin ribbon of cold fog spills inward, crawling along the deck plates against the airflow like it has weight and intent.

You lean out and fire a short, disciplined burst.

Rounds hammer the Hymn’s deck grating and the left bulkhead where the condensation handprint is sliding. Sparks skitter off the metal. The grating rings like a gong. Two rounds punch through something deeper—hollow space—kicking up a puff of rust and old insulation dust. There’s no blood. No meat-splash. But the condensation reacts: the hand-shape *jerks* as if flinching, smearing into a long drag-mark… and then it reforms, five streaks again, higher up the bulkhead, like it “stepped” without a body.

Your suit audio spikes: a close, wet inhale that isn’t yours, right at the edge of the open door gap. The door shudders harder. The obstruction isn’t physical in the usual way—no visible limb, no tool—just resistance, like trying to close on a pressure differential that shouldn’t exist.

You key Juno. Tightbeam tries to lock and fails twice. On the third attempt you get a broken thread of voice, layered with another signal under it—your old squad encryption key, ghosting the packet.

“—Mara, listen—” Juno says, breathy, scared. “It’s the *three-tap*. It rides open comms and structure. You—” A burst of static. Then, clearer but not Juno’s cadence, a voiceprint that makes your teeth ache: **“Vance.”**

The corridor lights answer with three amber pulses.

And now the tapping is inside the airlock with you: tap, tap, tap—coming from the *inner* faceplate of your helmet, like someone knocking from the wrong side of the glass.
