One holds a clipboard with a permit already filled out in crisp ink: **STABILITY PERMIT — LIORA THIMBLEWICK — APPROVED.** “For your safety,” he says, and drapes a length of velvet rope directly across the gap your map insists is a true route. Behind them, a Menagerie performer—goat-horned, face powdered with old greasepaint—hovers at the edge of a tent flap, clutching an acrobat’s silver wrist-wrap. Their eyes keep flicking to your satchel, to the torn seam of your Midnight Margins folio, as if your missing page is something they can smell.\n\nThe calliope repeats its wrong bar again. The signpost creaks and re-points itself.

The warmth is wrong: it doesn’t heat your skin; it *pulls* at something behind your teeth, like it wants a word you haven’t spoken yet. The calliope stutters and, for half a second, the wrong bar fits perfectly—as if pleased.\n\nYour knuckle taps the velvet rope. The sound is dull, like tapping a fresh bruise. The nearest Velvet Surveyor—pale gloves, polite eyes—turns his clipboard so you can see the permit’s seal.\n\nIt isn’t wax. It’s a pressed velvet stamp, dark as dried blood, with a cartographer’s rose wrapped in a noose-knot. Under it, a neat signature:\n\n**VELLUM-PRIOR HESK.**\n\n“We don’t ‘stabilize’ maps,” he says gently. “We stabilize *people* who insist on walking into errors.” He doesn’t move the rope. Instead, the second Surveyor casually rolls his measuring wheel one turn—just one—and the chalk circle under your compass *shifts* a finger-width, as if the ground accepted the measurement and corrected itself.\n\nThat tiny adjustment makes your compass needle quiver, then point—not north—but toward the velvet-rope detour.\n\nThe goat-horned performer steps out from the tent flap. Up close you can see their makeup is old enough to crack, and their pupils are filmed with ash. They keep the silver wrist-wrap clenched so tight it bites into their palm.\n\n“I recognize the *tear*,” they say, voice rough. “Not your book. The way it was taken.”\n\nThey lean in, just enough for you to smell them: smoke, milk-sour sweat, and something like singed lilac.\n\n“It smelled like **greasepaint and iron filings**,” they continue. “And… candle-breath. Like a lantern that’s been listening too long.” Their gaze flicks to the bruised-honey flame. “Pages don’t tear that clean unless someone uses velvet shears—or a vow.”\n\nAs they say *vow*, the lantern clicks once, sharp, like a throat clearing. From somewhere down the midway, another lantern answers by hissing, unmistakably: “**Li-o-ra.**”",

      "Beneath the burnt-sugar fog, three powers tug at the Midnight Margins. The Lantern-Choir tends the carnival’s lights, publicly guiding lost travelers with “helpful” glow, while secretly harvesting confessions from anyone who follows their murmuring flames. The Velvet Surveyors present themselves as a polite guild of mapmakers and safety-inspectors, yet they counterfeit routes to steer explorers into profitable disappearances and corner the trade in true directions. Opposing both, the Ashen Menagerie parades as a refuge for misfit beasts and cursed performers, but plots to unspool the carnival’s curse by breaking its rules—no matter who becomes collateral. The Choir bargains with the Menagerie for secrets; the Surveyors sabotage both, selling their feuds as “necessary order.”\n\n```json\n{\n  \"factions\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"The Lantern-Choir\",\n      \"public_front\": \"Caretakers of the carnival lanterns who guide the lost with gentle light and advice.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Collects whispered confessions and names through flame-murmurs to control who can safely navigate the Midnight Margins.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"The Velvet Surveyors\",\n      \"public_front\": \"A courteous guild of cartographers and 'safety inspectors' who offer maps, permits, and pathfinding services.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Forges routes and redirects travelers into engineered vanishings to monopolize true maps and sell 'certainty' at a premium.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"The Ashen Menagerie\",\n      \"public_front\": \"A sanctuary troupe for cursed performers and unsettling creatures seeking shelter and work.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Intends to fracture the carnival’s binding rules to unravel the curse, accepting collateral damage as the price of freedom.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

      "The midway has begun “skipping”—whole stretches of tents reappearing in wrong seasons—after a Lantern-Choir cantor named Sister Sable was caught coaxing confessions from a dying acrobat’s flame. The Ashen Menagerie shelters the acrobat’s grieving partner and plans a rule-breaking procession at moonrise to force the carnival to admit what it stole. Meanwhile, the Velvet Surveyors issue urgent “stability permits,” sealing paths with velvet rope and selling detours that quietly funnel buyers into the Vanishings Lot.

      "Last night, a lantern you don’t remember passing guttered to life beside your bedroll—glass crazed like old ice, flame the color of bruised honey. It spoke your name the way ink bleeds through paper: softly, insistently, as if the Carnival had finally found the edge of your map.\n\nThe Midway is skipping again. A row of tents wears spring blossoms at noon and hoarfrost by dusk; the calliope plays the same wrong bar until someone offers it a secret. And somewhere in that rearranging, a page has gone missing from your own work—your Midnight Margins folio—torn cleanly at the seam as though by velvet shears. In the tear’s fibers you find ash that smells of greasepaint, and a single pinprick of cold iron that stains your glove like a compass point.\n\nThe Velvet Surveyors have begun asking for you by your full name, politely, with permits already inked and waiting. Their velvet ropes “for safety” appear exactly where your sketches say a true path should be. Meanwhile, lanterns along the route hiss *Liora* with a hungry familiarity—Lantern-Choir cantors testing whether your name will lead them to the confession Sister Sable stole, or to whoever exposed her.\n\nAt moonrise, the Ashen Menagerie will march to break rules the Carnival has never forgiven. They’re sheltering the acrobat’s grieving partner—who keeps glancing at your satchel as if it contains a missing piece of someone’s last words.\n\nYou have clues: a page-shaped absence, ash-and-iron residue, lanterns that recognize you, and detours that don’t match the world. You also have a problem: in the Midnight Margins, being “findable” is the first step toward vanishing."

Somewhere beyond sight, calliope notes wobble—sweet, wrong—threaded with the soft argument of lantern-flames murmuring through cracked glass. The ground is packed velvet and ash; it gives underfoot as if remembering footsteps that never happened. Canvas tents breathe damp and mildew, exhaling old perfume, greasepaint, and the sharp, clean sting of ink. Shadows don’t sit still here; they sidle, rearranging themselves with polite patience. Every signpost creaks toward a different direction when you blink, and the air holds a listening hush, as though the world is waiting to be correctly named.",
      "Beneath the burnt-sugar fog, three powers tug at the Midnight Margins. The Lantern-Choir tends the carnival’s lights, publicly guiding lost travelers with “helpful” glow, while secretly harvesting confessions from anyone who follows their murmuring flames. The Velvet Surveyors present themselves as a polite guild of mapmakers and safety-inspectors, yet they counterfeit routes to steer explorers into profitable disappearances and corner the trade in true directions. Opposing both, the Ashen Menagerie parades as a refuge for misfit beasts and cursed performers, but plots to unspool the carnival’s curse by breaking its rules—no matter who becomes collateral. The Choir bargains with the Menagerie for secrets; the Surveyors sabotage both, selling their feuds as “necessary order.”\n\n```json\n{\n  \"factions\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"The Lantern-Choir\",\n      \"public_front\": \"Caretakers of the carnival lanterns who guide the lost with gentle light and advice.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Collects whispered confessions and names through flame-murmurs to control who can safely navigate the Midnight Margins.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"The Velvet Surveyors\",\n      \"public_front\": \"A courteous guild of cartographers and 'safety inspectors' who offer maps, permits, and pathfinding services.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Forges routes and redirects travelers into engineered vanishings to monopolize true maps and sell 'certainty' at a premium.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"The Ashen Menagerie\",\n      \"public_front\": \"A sanctuary troupe for cursed performers and unsettling creatures seeking shelter and work.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Intends to fracture the carnival’s binding rules to unravel the curse, accepting collateral damage as the price of freedom.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

      "The midway has begun “skipping”—whole stretches of tents reappearing in wrong seasons—after a Lantern-Choir cantor named Sister Sable was caught coaxing confessions from a dying acrobat’s flame. The Ashen Menagerie shelters the acrobat’s grieving partner and plans a rule-breaking procession at moonrise to force the carnival to admit what it stole. Meanwhile, the Velvet Surveyors issue urgent “stability permits,” sealing paths with velvet rope and selling detours that quietly funnel buyers into the Vanishings Lot.

      "Last night, a lantern you don’t remember passing guttered to life beside your bedroll—glass crazed like old ice, flame the color of bruised honey. It spoke your name the way ink bleeds through paper: softly, insistently, as if the Carnival had finally found the edge of your map.\n\nThe Midway is skipping again. A row of tents wears spring blossoms at noon and hoarfrost by dusk; the calliope plays the same wrong bar until someone offers it a secret. And somewhere in that rearranging, a page has gone missing from your own work—your Midnight Margins folio—torn cleanly at the seam as though by velvet shears. In the tear’s fibers you find ash that smells of greasepaint, and a single pinprick of cold iron that stains your glove like a compass point.\n\nThe Velvet Surveyors have begun asking for you by your full name, politely, with permits already inked and waiting. Their velvet ropes “for safety” appear exactly where your sketches say a true path should be. Meanwhile, lanterns along the route hiss *Liora* with a hungry familiarity—Lantern-Choir cantors testing whether your name will lead them to the confession Sister Sable stole, or to whoever exposed her.\n\nAt moonrise, the Ashen Menagerie will march to break rules the Carnival has never forgiven. They’re sheltering the acrobat’s grieving partner—who keeps glancing at your satchel as if it contains a missing piece of someone’s last words.\n\nYou have clues: a page-shaped absence, ash-and-iron residue, lanterns that recognize you, and detours that don’t match the world. You also have a problem: in the Midnight Margins, being “findable” is the first step toward vanishing."

Dew beads on velvet ropes strung between brass posts, and the calliope keeps worrying the same crooked measure as if it forgot the rest of the song. Lantern-glass clicks softly in the damp, like teeth.\n\nYou kneel beside a signpost labeled **Saffron Lane**—at least it was yesterday—and hold your compass over a chalk circle you drew at dawn. Ink-stained gloves steady your folio while you sketch the midway’s angles, noting which tent seams breathe and which shadows drift a step too far. A lantern nearby tries to “help” by brightening whenever your pen hesitates. You thank it anyway and write down the flicker pattern.\n\nThe lantern’s flame turns the color of bruised honey and speaks your name: *Liora Thimblewick.* Not as a greeting—more like a test. Across the path, three Velvet Surveyors approach in clean coats with soft smiles, their measuring wheel leaving neat tracks in ash. One holds a clipboard with a permit already filled out in crisp ink: **STABILITY PERMIT — LIORA THIMBLEWICK — APPROVED.** “For your safety,” he says, and drapes a length of velvet rope directly across the gap your map insists is a true route. Behind them, a Menagerie performer—goat-horned, face powdered with old greasepaint—hovers at the edge of a tent flap, clutching an acrobat’s silver wrist-wrap. Their eyes keep flicking to your satchel, to the torn seam of your Midnight Margins folio, as if your missing page is something they can smell.\n\nThe calliope repeats its wrong bar again. The signpost creaks and re-points itself. The lantern hisses *Liora* a second time, louder.\n\nAll three factions are watching the same spot on the ground—your spot—and the midway chooses this moment to “skip,” making the path ahead briefly wear spring blossoms, then hoarfrost. You have to answer the permit, the lantern, or the staring performer before the route changes again."

My fear, my truth, or my direction?”  \n\nWithout taking my compass off the chalk circle, I tap the velvet rope with my knuckle. “And you—who signed this Stability Permit? Show me the authorizing mark, or move your rope.”  \n\nThen I glance to the goat-horned performer and soften my voice. “You look like you recognize that folio seam. What do you know about the missing page—what did it smell like when it was torn free?”"

        "content": "The bruised-honey lantern leans its light toward your face as if it has a neck. Soot inside the crazed glass shifts, gathering into a thin, listening smear.\n\nWhen you ask what it’s measuring, the flame flutters—once, twice—then answers in a sing-song rhyme that doesn’t sound like it came from any mouth at all:\n\n“**Name to nail, name to knot—  \nwhich way walks the one who’s caught?  \nFear is tinder, truth is thread—  \ndirection’s what the lanterns wed.**”\n\nOn the last line, the lantern brightens sharply. The warmth is wrong: it doesn’t heat your skin; it *pulls* at something behind your teeth, like it wants a word you haven’t spoken yet. The calliope stutters and, for half a second, the wrong bar fits perfectly—as if pleased.\n\nYour knuckle taps the velvet rope. The sound is dull, like tapping a fresh bruise. The nearest Velvet Surveyor—pale gloves, polite eyes—turns his clipboard so you can see the permit’s seal.\n\nIt isn’t wax. It’s a pressed velvet stamp, dark as dried blood, with a cartographer’s rose wrapped in a noose-knot. Under it, a neat signature:\n\n**VELLUM-PRIOR HESK.**\n\n“We don’t ‘stabilize’ maps,” he says gently. “We stabilize *people* who insist on walking into errors.” He doesn’t move the rope. Instead, the second Surveyor casually rolls his measuring wheel one turn—just one—and the chalk circle under your compass *shifts* a finger-width, as if the ground accepted the measurement and corrected itself.\n\nThat tiny adjustment makes your compass needle quiver, then point—not north—but toward the velvet-rope detour.\n\nThe goat-horned performer steps out from the tent flap. Up close you can see their makeup is old enough to crack, and their pupils are filmed with ash. They keep the silver wrist-wrap clenched so tight it bites into their palm.\n\n“I recognize the *tear*,” they say, voice rough. “Not your book. The way it was taken.”\n\nThey lean in, just enough for you to smell them: smoke, milk-sour sweat, and something like singed lilac.\n\n“It smelled like **greasepaint and iron filings**,” they continue. “And… candle-breath. Like a lantern that’s been listening too long.” Their gaze flicks to the bruised-honey flame. “Pages don’t tear that clean unless someone uses velvet shears—or a vow.”\n\nAs they say *vow*, the lantern clicks once, sharp, like a throat clearing. From somewhere down the midway, another lantern answers by hissing, unmistakably: “**Li-o-ra.**”"

Not today.”  \n\nI jab my pencil tip into the ground at the *original* edge of my chalk circle and sketch a quick double-ring around it in my folio. Then I look the Surveyor dead on. “Vellum-Prior Hesk—where do I find him, and what *error* do you think I am?”  \n\nI turn back to the goat-horned performer, voice low and eager. “Velvet shears—whose hands held them? Was it an act, a tailor, a Surveyor… or a lantern-keeper?”  \n\nFinally, I angle my body toward the second hissing lantern down the midway and call out, cautiously polite: “Which lantern is that—do you have a color, a name, or only mine?”"
