A uniformed guard barks at someone behind you, and you don’t look back. Your cheap camera bumps your ribs with each step. Ahead, a door swings shut—Records—and you catch the last slice of light before the latch clicks. You slide a hand under your coat and feel paper edges: the torn appointment card, damp with sweat.\n\nThis is City Hall, third floor, where clerks and judges turn neighborhoods into numbers. You’re Elias Marrow—Eli to the few who still bother—private investigator with a notebook full of dates and a habit of watching hands instead of faces. The pawnshop stamp on that old ticket still shows in your mind like an ink bruise. You’re here because your name is on a Saint Brigid Trust report you never touched, and because paper is the only thing in this city that doesn’t forget.\n\nA woman steps out of a stairwell and cuts you off hard enough that you nearly collide. She’s in a nurse’s coat under a soaked overcoat, hair pinned up like she did it in the dark. She grabs your sleeve, nails digging through wool. “They’re moving the ledger,” she says, breathless. “Saint Brigid Trust—the charity that runs the clinics—sent men to ‘secure’ Records. Halcyon Civic League—the civic group with the soup lines and the judges—has their security detail on this floor.” She forces something into your palm: a brass key tagged ROOM 3B-12, and a donor code scribbled on the back of a ward receipt. “The clerk who took it? They found his satchel. Empty. Dockside Brotherhood—the dock union that sells muscle—has spotters downstairs. They’re telling people you stole it. If you don’t get to 3B-12 before the hearing clerks do, they’ll bury the names and hang you with the theft.”\n\nHer grip loosens. Behind you, footsteps settle into a steady pace, not rushing—closing. The Records door down the hall opens a fraction, and you see a man’s hand, clean and gloved, testing the latch like he owns it.\n\nYou’re in the corridor between the hearing offices and Records, key in hand, with three factions converging on the same paper trail and your name already written on the blame.

Used for… adjustments.” Her gaze flicks to your palmed key. “Name’s Lorna. Lorna Vess. I’m not supposed to be here.”\n\nYou keep your body between her and the corridor and snap the blind shot at waist level.\n\nThe camera’s shutter gives a soft, traitorous click in the hush. In the door-glass reflection to your right—warped by old wavy panes—you catch the shape behind you: a man in a neat dark coat, hat brim low, gloved hands. He isn’t hurrying. He’s matching your pace like he’s got all night and paperwork on his side.\n\nAs you start your steady walk toward 3B-12, Lorna drifts with you for three steps, still “arguing.” “Halcyon’s security are on this floor,” she says, lips barely moving. “If they stop you, don’t show the key. Say you’re here for a hearing file pull—Clerk Durn’s desk. And—Eli—” she swallows when she says your name, like it tastes dangerous, “Saint Brigid’s men are looking for someone to pin this on. They already picked you.”\n\nDown the hall, a pair of City Hall clerks emerge from an office with a tied bundle of folders and a red wax seal; they pause, noticing the nurse and you, then keep going faster than they mean to. Near Records, the door that was cracked earlier eases shut again—careful, controlled—like someone inside just decided to wait.\n\nYou reach the section marker: **3B** stenciled on the wall. The corridor narrows here; the air smells of wet wool and old carbon paper. Ahead, **3B-12** sits with a frosted-glass panel and a brass lock that matches the key tag in your palm.\n\nBehind you, the gloved man’s reflection grows larger in the glass as he closes the distance—still not running.\n\n**Status updates:**  \n- Tail confirmed: dark coat, gloves  \n- Lorna Vess identified  \n- 3B-12 located, locked  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"Brass key tagged ROOM 3B-12\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"City Hall, 3rd Floor (3B corridor)\",\"Room 3B-12 (door located)\"],\"npcs_add\":[\"Lorna Vess (nurse, Saint Brigid ward)\",\"Unknown tail (dark coat, gloves)\"]}\n```",

Down in Saint Brigid’s charity ward, a records clerk has gone missing with intake ledgers naming donors, judges, and a certain well-dressed patron—now the Trust is locking down clinics while Halcyon offers “protection.” Eli’s name is circulating as a convenient thief, and Brotherhood spotters are tailing him.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"events\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"The Renewal Hearing\",\n      \"description\": \"Halcyon Civic League pushes a fast-tracked urban renewal case through City Hall using a bought judge and forged tenant records, while Dockside Brotherhood muscle clears targeted buildings ahead of inspectors via intimidation and staged “accidents.”\",\n      \"tensions\": [\n        \"Tenants disappear or recant under pressure\",\n        \"Arson and beatings spike in the redevelopment blocks\",\n        \"Any investigator near the paper trail becomes a scapegoat\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Saint Brigid Ledger Lockdown\",\n      \"description\": \"A Saint Brigid Trust clerk vanishes with clinic intake ledgers that can tie donors and officials—including a well-dressed patron—to blackmail and bribes; the Trust seals wards, Halcyon offers security, and the Brotherhood hunts the missing files for leverage.\",\n      \"tensions\": [\n        \"Patients are turned away, sparking unrest and riots\",\n        \"Witnesses are silenced before they can talk\",\n        \"Eli is framed as the thief to draw heat off the real players\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
      "Eli Marrow hasn’t slept since his name showed up on a Saint Brigid “incident report” stamped **THEFT—INTAKE LEDGERS** in neat, church-bureaucrat ink. He didn’t steal anything—he didn’t even know the ledgers existed until a jittery nurse pressed a torn appointment card into his palm outside the charity ward and whispered, “If they ask, you never saw me.” The card lists a date, a donor code, and a room number at City Hall—same floor as the Renewal Hearing clerks.\n\nNow the city is leaning in. Dockside Brotherhood spotters keep appearing in reflections: diner windows, rain puddles, the chrome of his cheap camera. Halcyon’s “security detail” has started asking polite questions of anyone who ever pawned a camera, a notebook, or a wedding ring at Marrow’s family shop. Someone’s building a timeline with Eli at the center.\n\nThe missing clerk—last seen hauling a satchel marked **BRIGID ARCHIVES**—left a trail of wet footprints into a service corridor that shouldn’t connect to the street. Eli found the corridor door chained shut…with a pawn ticket threaded through the links. His family’s shop stamp. Issued the week it collapsed. Signed by a name he’s only seen on old foreclosure notices: the well-dressed patron.\n\nIf Eli pulls on the ledgers, he could expose who bought the judge, who ordered the fires, and why the tenant rolls were rewritten. But every step toward the paper trail makes him easier to catch—and harder to clear. In this city, innocence isn’t a shield. It’s a vacancy someone else will fill."

      "Rain can’t wash the soot off this week. Halcyon Civic League’s “Renewal Hearing” opens at City Hall, but the judge is already bought and the tenant roll is already forged; Dockside Brotherhood crews are clearing buildings the night before with quiet batons and louder fires. Down in Saint Brigid’s charity ward, a records clerk has gone missing with intake ledgers naming donors, judges, and a certain well-dressed patron—now the Trust is locking down clinics while Halcyon offers “protection.” Eli’s name is circulating as a convenient thief, and Brotherhood spotters are tailing him.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"events\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"The Renewal Hearing\",\n      \"description\": \"Halcyon Civic League pushes a fast-tracked urban renewal case through City Hall using a bought judge and forged tenant records, while Dockside Brotherhood muscle clears targeted buildings ahead of inspectors via intimidation and staged “accidents.”\",\n      \"tensions\": [\n        \"Tenants disappear or recant under pressure\",\n        \"Arson and beatings spike in the redevelopment blocks\",\n        \"Any investigator near the paper trail becomes a scapegoat\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Saint Brigid Ledger Lockdown\",\n      \"description\": \"A Saint Brigid Trust clerk vanishes with clinic intake ledgers that can tie donors and officials—including a well-dressed patron—to blackmail and bribes; the Trust seals wards, Halcyon offers security, and the Brotherhood hunts the missing files for leverage.\",\n      \"tensions\": [\n        \"Patients are turned away, sparking unrest and riots\",\n        \"Witnesses are silenced before they can talk\",\n        \"Eli is framed as the thief to draw heat off the real players\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",
      "Eli Marrow hasn’t slept since his name showed up on a Saint Brigid “incident report” stamped **THEFT—INTAKE LEDGERS** in neat, church-bureaucrat ink. He didn’t steal anything—he didn’t even know the ledgers existed until a jittery nurse pressed a torn appointment card into his palm outside the charity ward and whispered, “If they ask, you never saw me.” The card lists a date, a donor code, and a room number at City Hall—same floor as the Renewal Hearing clerks.\n\nNow the city is leaning in. Dockside Brotherhood spotters keep appearing in reflections: diner windows, rain puddles, the chrome of his cheap camera. Halcyon’s “security detail” has started asking polite questions of anyone who ever pawned a camera, a notebook, or a wedding ring at Marrow’s family shop. Someone’s building a timeline with Eli at the center.\n\nThe missing clerk—last seen hauling a satchel marked **BRIGID ARCHIVES**—left a trail of wet footprints into a service corridor that shouldn’t connect to the street. Eli found the corridor door chained shut…with a pawn ticket threaded through the links. His family’s shop stamp. Issued the week it collapsed. Signed by a name he’s only seen on old foreclosure notices: the well-dressed patron.\n\nIf Eli pulls on the ledgers, he could expose who bought the judge, who ordered the fires, and why the tenant rolls were rewritten. But every step toward the paper trail makes him easier to catch—and harder to clear. In this city, innocence isn’t a shield. It’s a vacancy someone else will fill."

A uniformed guard barks at someone behind you, and you don’t look back. Your cheap camera bumps your ribs with each step. Ahead, a door swings shut—Records—and you catch the last slice of light before the latch clicks. You slide a hand under your coat and feel paper edges: the torn appointment card, damp with sweat.\n\nThis is City Hall, third floor, where clerks and judges turn neighborhoods into numbers. You’re Elias Marrow—Eli to the few who still bother—private investigator with a notebook full of dates and a habit of watching hands instead of faces. The pawnshop stamp on that old ticket still shows in your mind like an ink bruise. You’re here because your name is on a Saint Brigid Trust report you never touched, and because paper is the only thing in this city that doesn’t forget.\n\nA woman steps out of a stairwell and cuts you off hard enough that you nearly collide. She’s in a nurse’s coat under a soaked overcoat, hair pinned up like she did it in the dark. She grabs your sleeve, nails digging through wool. “They’re moving the ledger,” she says, breathless. “Saint Brigid Trust—the charity that runs the clinics—sent men to ‘secure’ Records. Halcyon Civic League—the civic group with the soup lines and the judges—has their security detail on this floor.” She forces something into your palm: a brass key tagged ROOM 3B-12, and a donor code scribbled on the back of a ward receipt. “The clerk who took it? They found his satchel. Empty. Dockside Brotherhood—the dock union that sells muscle—has spotters downstairs. They’re telling people you stole it. If you don’t get to 3B-12 before the hearing clerks do, they’ll bury the names and hang you with the theft.”\n\nHer grip loosens. Behind you, footsteps settle into a steady pace, not rushing—closing. The Records door down the hall opens a fraction, and you see a man’s hand, clean and gloved, testing the latch like he owns it.\n\nYou’re in the corridor between the hearing offices and Records, key in hand, with three factions converging on the same paper trail and your name already written on the blame. The next door that opens decides whether you walk out of City Hall or disappear inside it."

Used for… adjustments.” Her gaze flicks to your palmed key. “Name’s Lorna. Lorna Vess. I’m not supposed to be here.”\n\nYou keep your body between her and the corridor and snap the blind shot at waist level.\n\nThe camera’s shutter gives a soft, traitorous click in the hush. In the door-glass reflection to your right—warped by old wavy panes—you catch the shape behind you: a man in a neat dark coat, hat brim low, gloved hands. He isn’t hurrying. He’s matching your pace like he’s got all night and paperwork on his side.\n\nAs you start your steady walk toward 3B-12, Lorna drifts with you for three steps, still “arguing.” “Halcyon’s security are on this floor,” she says, lips barely moving. “If they stop you, don’t show the key. Say you’re here for a hearing file pull—Clerk Durn’s desk. And—Eli—” she swallows when she says your name, like it tastes dangerous, “Saint Brigid’s men are looking for someone to pin this on. They already picked you.”\n\nDown the hall, a pair of City Hall clerks emerge from an office with a tied bundle of folders and a red wax seal; they pause, noticing the nurse and you, then keep going faster than they mean to. Near Records, the door that was cracked earlier eases shut again—careful, controlled—like someone inside just decided to wait.\n\nYou reach the section marker: **3B** stenciled on the wall. The corridor narrows here; the air smells of wet wool and old carbon paper. Ahead, **3B-12** sits with a frosted-glass panel and a brass lock that matches the key tag in your palm.\n\nBehind you, the gloved man’s reflection grows larger in the glass as he closes the distance—still not running.\n\n**Status updates:**  \n- Tail confirmed: dark coat, gloves  \n- Lorna Vess identified  \n- 3B-12 located, locked  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"Brass key tagged ROOM 3B-12\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"City Hall, 3rd Floor (3B corridor)\",\"Room 3B-12 (door located)\"],\"npcs_add\":[\"Lorna Vess (nurse, Saint Brigid ward)\",\"Unknown tail (dark coat, gloves)\"]}\n```"
