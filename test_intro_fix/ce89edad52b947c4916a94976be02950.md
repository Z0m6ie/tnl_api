### Turn 4 [PLAYER]

Elias Crowe grew up in a tenement shadowed by union strikes and unsolved disappearances that taught him to watch first and speak last. A private investigator specializing in missing persons, he keeps meticulous notes and never walks into a room without reading it like a crime scene. Careful, observant, and relentlessly patient, he weighs every word as if it might be used against him. He’s driven to find his sister’s killer, even if the truth rots the city’s last clean corners.

*Agent reasoning: Generated cautious-style character for Noir Mystery*

### Turn 5 [GAME]

Here's your character:

**Elias Crowe**
*Private Investigator (Missing Persons Specialist)*

Elias Crowe was raised in a soot-stained tenement district where union strikes, backroom deals, and sudden disappearances were just part of the weather. After his younger sister vanished and the case was quietly shelved, he learned to trust paper trails over promises and to let silence do the heavy lifting. Now he lives above his office with a wall of clippings and case notes, convinced the city’s rot has a name and he’s seen it before.

**Traits:** Careful and methodical, Highly observant, Relentlessly patient, Soft-spoken but incisive, Morally stubborn
**Goal:** Identify and bring to light the truth behind his sister’s disappearance and murder—no matter who it implicates—while preventing the same machinery from claiming another missing person.

### Turn 9 [GAME]

You wake before the alarm because you always do when the city starts moving wrong. The rain on the window sounds like fingers testing a lock. You lie still on the narrow bed above your office and count the gaps between factory whistles, like you used to count the days after your sister vanished. You want proof, not a story. You want a name that can’t duck behind a committee vote or a charity banner. Wanting doesn’t help. Paper does.

Downstairs, your office smells of damp wool and old paste. You boil water on the hot plate and lay out yesterday’s notes in a straight line: three addresses, two false ones, one that might hold. Your wall of clippings gets a new pin, placed by habit, not hope. You check the lock on the file cabinet, then the window latch, then the revolver in the desk drawer. You don’t trust the night to stay outside.

The knock comes while you’re rinsing the cup—three light taps, a pause, then two like someone counting breaths. You don’t move at first. No one who needs help knocks like that. You cross the room without turning on the overhead light and listen to the hallway. Nothing but water in the gutters and a distant trolley. When you open the door, the corridor is empty. On the floor sits a damp envelope, edges dark with rain. It smells faintly of coal tar and chapel incense. Inside is a Civic Virtue League ration chit stamped **TONIGHT—CURFEW ESCORT**, and a torn strip of crate-manifest paper: **PIER NINE / SEAL: VEYLAN**, smeared but readable. On the back, in a careful hand you have not seen since an old postcard, are two words: **DRY DROWN.** Your throat tightens. Your sister’s handwriting should be in a box, not on your doorstep.

You set the papers on your desk and keep your hands flat beside them so you don’t crumple anything. Someone knows where you live. Someone wants you to move, and they’re using her to do it. You can ignore it and stay alive longer, or you can follow it and find out who learned her hand well enough to cut with it.

### Turn 10 [PLAYER]

I slip the envelope and papers into evidence sleeves, dust them lightly for prints, then kill the lamp and watch the street from behind the blinds for a full five minutes. After that, I make two calls—first to a dock contact to ask what runs through Pier Nine under the Veylan seal, then to the Civic Virtue League office to verify what a “Tonight—Curfew Escort” chit authorizes and who issued it.

*Agent reasoning: This feels like bait. Before I move, I need to preserve evidence, check for surveillance, and figure out what “Veylan” and the Civic Virtue League chit really buy someone.*

### Turn 11 [GAME]



### Turn 12 [PLAYER]

I slide the envelope and both papers into evidence sleeves, dust them lightly for prints, then cut the lamp and watch the street through the blinds for five full minutes. After that I place two calls—first to my dock contact to ask what’s moving through Pier Nine under the Veylan seal, then to the Civic Virtue League office to confirm what a “Tonight—Curfew Escort” chit authorizes and who signed it.

*Agent reasoning: The note could be bait; before heading anywhere I need to preserve evidence, check if I’m being watched, and verify what Pier Nine/Veylan and that curfew chit really mean through contacts who might know.*

### Turn 13 [GAME]



### Turn 14 [PLAYER]

I slide the envelope and both papers into evidence sleeves, dust them lightly for prints, then cut the lamp and watch the street through the blinds for five full minutes. After that I place two calls—first to my dock contact to ask what’s moving through Pier Nine under the Veylan seal, then to the Civic Virtue League office to confirm what a “Tonight—Curfew Escort” chit authorizes and who signed it.

*Agent reasoning: Someone baited me with my sister’s handwriting; before I move, I need to preserve evidence, check if I’m being watched, and verify the two leads (Pier Nine/Veylan and the League chit) through low-risk calls.*
