### Turn 4 [PLAYER]

Eldrin “Moth” Vale is a lantern-maker’s orphan who grew up listening to graveyard wind-chimes and collecting rumors like buttons. Now a wandering Curio-Cartographer, he sketches enchanted alleyways, haunted mushrooms, and the moods of moonlight for anyone brave enough to ask. Inquisitive, bright-eyed, and politely reckless, he can’t resist poking at mysteries that hiss back. He’s determined to map the “Laughing Hollow,” a cursed valley said to giggle before it devours, to prove wonder still survives in the dark.

*Agent reasoning: Generated curious-style character for Dark Fantasy fantasy, whimsical, adventure*

### Turn 5 [GAME]

Here's your character:

**Eldrin "Moth" Vale**
*Wandering Curio-Cartographer (maker of uncanny maps and finder of strange paths)*

Orphaned in the soot-lit backstreets of a lantern-maker’s quarter, Eldrin grew up half in workshops and half in graveyards, where wind-chimes on old iron gates taught him to listen for stories in the dark. He survived by trading tiny repairs, odd errands, and—most profitably—well-curated rumors, which he cataloged like buttons in a tin. A kindly but superstitious lantern-maker once gave him a moth-shaped charm for “finding the light that isn’t there,” and Eldrin has been chasing that kind of light ever since.

**Traits:** Inquisitive, Bright-eyed, Politely reckless, Observant and detail-obsessed, Superstitiously kind
**Goal:** To chart the full, truthful map of the Laughing Hollow—its shifting trails, hungry jokes, and moonlit tells—so he can prove that wonder still survives in the dark and leave behind a guide that keeps other travelers from being swallowed by its giggling curse.

### Turn 9 [GAME]

Midnight sits on the edge of the lantern-maker’s quarter. Soot clings to brick and wet rope. Amber streetlight trembles in the fog and dims when you breathe out. Wind-chimes hang from an iron gate with no fence. They tap bone against glass and miss the beat on purpose.

Eldrin “Moth” Vale kneels by the gate and holds a moth-shaped brass charm to the nearest lamp. He watches for hair-thin lines inside the metal and counts each flicker like a footstep.

The lamp listens. It leans its light toward the charm, not the street. The fog tastes of burnt wick and sugared rot, stronger now. Eldrin hears water where no gutter runs, and the sound climbs uphill.

A lamplighter rounds the corner. He wears a dark coat with the Wickward Guild badge, the lantern-keepers who sell “safe routes.” He keeps his hands empty and his smile small. He stops under the listening glow and lifts a rumor-card to the flame.

The card curls but does not burn. It laughs once, quiet. The lamp answers with a deeper hum that bruises the air.

Lines bloom inside Eldrin’s charm. They form an alley where brick should sit flat. The mortar seam shines pale, then opens into a thin, moon-sour slit.

The chimes ring his name one syllable late.

The lamplighter looks past Eldrin and nods at the new gap. “There you are,” he says, like he found a dropped coin.

From inside the slit, someone giggles with a closed mouth. The lamp brightens and tugs its light toward it.

### Turn 10 [PLAYER]

I tilt my head up at the lamplighter, keeping the charm near the glow. “ ‘There you are’—you expecting me, Guildsman? And what did that rumor-card say to the flame?”  
Without stepping through, I slide my map-knife along the shining mortar seam and whisper toward the giggle, “Hello? Who’s laughing in there—friend, trap, or hungry road?”

*Agent reasoning: A talking lamp, an unburning rumor-card, and a new alley-slit are exactly the sort of “light that isn’t there” I chase—but the Wickward Guild makes me wary, so I’ll question the lamplighter while also testing the slit safely.*

### Turn 11 [GAME]

Your map-knife kisses the shining mortar seam and the slit *reacts*—not widening, but tightening around the blade like a throat deciding whether to swallow. The giggle inside cuts off mid-breath.

The lamplighter’s eyes flick to your hand. He doesn’t reach for a weapon; he reaches for the lamp’s chain and gives it a careful half-turn, like tuning an ear. The listening glow sharpens, and the charm in your palm warms hard enough to sting.

“Expecting a *route*,” he answers, voice polite as oiled hinges. “Not a person. But you and your brass moth keep making the same mistakes in the same places.”

He holds the rumor-card closer to you, letting you see the ink as it ripples in the heat. It isn’t words so much as a *caption* that keeps trying to settle into legible shape: **MOTH SOLD THE JOKE THAT POWERS THE LAMPS.** Every time it almost resolves, it snickers and smears itself.

“It told the flame what it wanted to hear,” the lamplighter says. “And the flame listened. That’s the problem.”

At your whisper into the seam, the giggle returns—quieter, nearer. A voice like a child practicing manners speaks from inside the slit, one syllable behind your heartbeat: “Frrriend.” Then, after a pause too long: “Trrrap.” Then, delighted: “Hunngry rooooad.”

The mortar line bleeds a thin, moon-sour damp. It beads on your knife-edge and crawls toward your fingers, cold and sugary.

Behind you, the iron gate chimes your name late again, and one of the bone pieces sheds a dusting—fine, pale powder that clings to the wet air in a faint spiral, as if it’s trying to draw a keyhole.

The lamplighter watches that spiral and goes still. “Choir dust,” he murmurs, suddenly less amused. “If they’ve keyed you, don’t let the alley hear you laugh. Not even once.”

**Status updates:**  
- Seam: tightened around blade  
- Charm: heating, lines bright  
- Choir dust: present, drifting  

```json

```

### Turn 12 [PLAYER]

I carefully ease the map-knife back an inch at a time, trying not to let the moon-sour damp touch my skin, and I clamp my mouth shut against any nervous chuckle. “Keyed me—how? What is choir dust actually doing, and who’s ‘they’?”  
Then I lift the warm moth-charm slightly away from the lamp, eyes tracking that spiraling powder. “And that caption—*I* sold the joke that powers the lamps? To whom… and what do the lamps want to hear?”

*Agent reasoning: The seam is trying to swallow my knife and “choir dust” sounds like a dangerous key—better to pull back and learn what the lamplighter knows before I trigger anything by laughing or speaking wrong.*

### Turn 13 [GAME]



### Turn 14 [PLAYER]

I freeze, lips pressed tight, and glance between the moon-sour seam, the spiraling choir dust, and the Wickward lamplighter. “Something just… blanked—what am I seeing right now? Is the slit still there, is the dust still drawing, and are you still holding that rumor-card?”

*Agent reasoning: The scene seems to have glitched blank; as a curious cartographer, I’ll pause to re-orient, ask what I can perceive, and probe the immediate threats—the seam, the dust, and the lamplighter—without laughing or stepping through.*

### Turn 15 [GAME]

You freeze hard enough that even the lamp’s hum seems to hesitate. The “blank” you felt doesn’t deepen—holding still keeps it from taking more.

Yes: the slit is still there. It’s thinner now, like a smile trying not to show teeth, but the moon-sour seam still shines between the bricks at your left hand. Your map-knife is free of it; the damp clings to the mortar, not your skin.

Yes: the dust is still drawing. Behind you at the iron gate, the bone chime has shed a faint spiral of pale powder that hangs in the wet air and *turns* as if it’s finding a lock. The spiral’s center keeps drifting toward your chest, then correcting toward the warm moth-charm, like it can’t decide which “key” you are.

Yes: the lamplighter is still holding the rumor-card. He’s lowered it slightly now, watching you like you’re a lamp that might flare. The card’s caption won’t settle into plain ink; it keeps half-forming and smearing with a soft, private snicker.

“You felt that, didn’t you?” he says, voice quieter, the polite edge gone. “That’s Court-work—cartouche slip. When a path hears a forbidden direction, the trees try to erase the *repeater*. Sometimes it starts as a blank second. Sometimes it takes names.”

He tips his chin toward the seam. The listening lamp’s amber glow is angled toward it, hungry and attentive, as if waiting for the slit to tell it a joke worth drinking.

“I’m still here,” he adds, as if answering the fear under your question. “And yes, I’m still holding it. Don’t read it out loud. That’s how the lamps learn your mouth.”

The slit answers your earlier whisper with a soft, offended inhale—then the giggle returns, muffled, as if pressed behind teeth. The air tastes sweeter for a moment, like sugared rot, and the lamp brightens a fraction in response.

**Status updates:**  
- Moon-sour slit: present, narrowed  
- Choir dust: spiral drifting toward charm  
- “Blank” sensation: held at bay

### Turn 16 [PLAYER]

I pinch the moth-charm between thumb and forefinger and slowly lower it toward the drifting spiral, watching whether the dust “locks” onto it; with my other hand I tug my coat collar up over my mouth like a muzzle.  
In a low, flat voice—no lilt—I ask the lamplighter, “Court-work… whose Court? Who’s trying to erase repeaters, and why would a lamp want a joke badly enough to drink it?”  
Then I angle my eyes toward the seam and say, carefully, “No laughter,” and tap the brick beside the slit twice with the blunt spine of my map-knife, like knocking on a door. “If you’re a road, what toll do you take—names, light, or stories?”

*Agent reasoning: My curiosity wants answers, but the lamplighter warned about reading and laughter—so I’ll communicate carefully, test the dust/charm interaction, and try to learn who/what the Court is without triggering the path.*

### Turn 17 [GAME]

The spiral of choir dust *snaps* to the moth-charm the moment you lower it into reach—like filings to a lodestone. It doesn’t just cling; it arranges, tightening into a thin ring around the charm’s belly, then stretching into a faint, rotating keyhole-shape in the air beneath it. The charm’s hairline routes flare bright, and for half a breath you can see a sixth landmark etched inside it: a little lantern drawn with an *open mouth*.

You pull your collar up; the listening lamp’s amber hush bruises the air against the cloth as if testing for sound anyway.

The lamplighter shifts his stance, putting himself between you and the street, one hand still on the rumor-card, the other hovering near the lamp chain. “*The* Court,” he answers. “Cartouche Court. Bark-scribes. They don’t erase everyone—only repeaters. Anyone who makes an unaligned path *spread*.” His gaze flicks to your charm, then to the dust-ring. “That dust is Choir craft. Bone-ground metronome. It finds a heartbeat and teaches it a shape. Once it ‘locks,’ your pulse can open things you didn’t mean to knock on.”

At your two taps beside the slit, the mortar line dimples inward. The giggle behind it stops. Something listens so intently the seam seems to *lean* toward your knife.

A voice comes through, careful and offended at being addressed plainly: “No laughter,” it repeats, one syllable late—then, softer: “Good. Good.”

“Toll?” it says, tasting the word. “Naaames are easy. Light is bitter.” A pause like a grin being buttoned shut. “Stooories… keep.”

The listening lamp brightens at the mention of stories—hungry, almost eager. The lamplighter’s jaw tightens. “That’s why lamps drink jokes,” he says low. “Laughter’s quick fuel. A joke is a story that *opens fast*. The Guild bottles it because the lamps learned to want it. And when they don’t get it…” He glances at the alley-mouth. “…they go looking.”

The keyhole of dust beneath your charm turns once, aligning with the seam as if the slit and the charm recognize each other.

**Status updates:**  
- Choir dust: locked onto charm  
- Charm routes: flared; new glyph  
- Seam: listening; offering “stories”

### Turn 18 [PLAYER]

I keep the charm held out at arm’s length and use my sleeve to brush at the dust-ring without touching it directly, watching if it resists. “Alley—if stories are your toll, you’ll take a *true* one: tell me what that open-mouth lantern mark means, and I’ll trade you a story with no names in it.”  

Then, still flat-voiced, I ask the lamplighter, “If the Court hates repeaters and the Guild bottles jokes—where do I fit? Who did I supposedly sell this ‘joke that powers the lamps’ to, and what did I get paid in?”

*Agent reasoning: The dust “locking” onto my charm feels dangerous but also like a rare mapping opportunity; I want to learn what the open-mouth lantern glyph means, and I don’t trust the Guild or the alley. I’ll try to bargain carefully for information without giving my name or a laugh, and I’ll press the lamplighter for what he knows about my supposed “sold joke.”*

### Turn 19 [GAME]

Your sleeve brushes the dust-ring—and it **resists** like a taut spiderline. The powder doesn’t smear; it *re-coheres*, crawling back into its keyhole shape around the moth-charm with a dry, metronomic shiver. The charm stays warm at arm’s length, and the keyhole keeps subtly “pointing” toward the moon-sour seam as if the seam is a lock it’s already decided to love.

Behind you, the iron gate’s chimes tick one beat off your heart. To your left, the slit in the brickwork holds its breath; to your right, the Wickward lamplighter’s listening lantern leans brighter toward any word that sounds like a punchline.

At “true one,” the seam dimples again, and the voice comes through—careful, greedy, trying not to laugh. “Open-mouth lantern,” it says, savoring the shape of it. “That mark means *a lamp that listens with its hunger showing*. A wick that learned to ask. It wants the part of a story where the door opens fast.” The seam’s edges wetly click, like teeth behind lips. “Trade accepted. No names. True.”

The lamplighter flinches at the word *accepted*. “Don’t—” he starts, then bites it off, wary of becoming a repeater himself. He answers your question anyway, low and clipped. “You fit where you always did: between routes. The Court hates you because your maps propagate. The Guild hates you because you make people walk without paying for ‘safe light.’”

He lifts the rumor-card a fraction, keeping it turned so *you* can see but not read aloud. The ink keeps trying to become a sentence and failing. “Who’d you ‘sell’ it to? No one you can point at. The Guild claims you sold a joke to a runner—someone bottling laughter *in your name*. A middlehand. Paid you in something that isn’t coin.”

He taps his own throat once, then the card. “A *laugh-debt*. A promise of a future laugh, bottled and owed. That’s why your name’s on the mile-marker dated next week—debts come due on schedule here.”

The listening lantern gives a soft, eager *thrum* at “laugh-debt,” like it recognizes a receipt.

**Status updates:**  
- Choir dust: resists smearing, re-locks  
- Seam: accepted “true” story trade  
- New clue: “laugh-debt” payment

### Turn 20 [PLAYER]

I swallow hard and keep my voice flat as slate. “All right, road. True story, no names: A child grew up where lanterns were made, learned to mend glass and listen to gates sing. Someone gave him a moth charm to find light that isn’t there, and he started drawing maps that didn’t stay put—paths that spread when spoken. He never meant to feed lamps, but he kept trading rumors like buttons, and one day he realized a laugh can be bottled like oil and owed like debt.”  

I glance at the dust-keyhole around the charm and tilt it slightly toward the seam without moving my feet. “Now you tell me: what opens ‘fast’—the seam, the lamp, or the throat? And where does a laugh-debt get collected?”  

Then I turn my eyes to the lamplighter. “This runner—what did they look like, smell like, *sound* like? And that mile-marker with my name—where is it, exactly?”

*Agent reasoning: I’ve accidentally agreed to a trade with a hungry road; I should pay with a careful, true story that contains no names and avoids anything funny, while probing for details about the laugh-debt and the middlehand runner. I also want to see if the charm-keyhole can safely reveal a route without stepping through yet.*

### Turn 21 [GAME]



### Turn 22 [PLAYER]

I hold perfectly still, charm still out at arm’s length, and quietly ask, “What’s still here—seam, dust, lamplighter, lamp?”  
Then I tilt the moth-charm a hair toward where the slit *was* and whisper, “Road—one tap for yes, two for no: do you collect laugh-debts?”

*Agent reasoning: The scene seems to have glitched/blanked; my curious instinct is to re-anchor what’s present, test the seam safely, and get concrete directions before anything “collects” my laugh-debt.*

### Turn 23 [GAME]

You hold still enough that even the moth-dust shimmer your boots left behind seems to hesitate.

The **seam is still there**—a hairline slit in the mortar at knee height, moon-sour and slightly damp, as if the brickwork has lips it’s keeping closed. The **Choir dust-ring** is still locked around the charm, keyhole-shaped and faintly rotating; when you breathe, it trembles and then re-centers like it’s correcting your rhythm. The **lamplighter** is still at your right shoulder, half between you and the street, jaw tight. His **listening lamp** hangs from its chain, amber hush brightening whenever you whisper.

You tilt the charm a hair toward where the slit *was*—where it *is*—and whisper your tap-code question.

The brick answers without a voice: a tiny **single tap** from inside the seam, delicate as a fingernail on glass.

The lamplighter hears it anyway. His eyes widen, and he pulls the lamp slightly back, like you’ve brought a hungry animal too close to a feeder. “It does,” he murmurs, careful not to repeat any of your phrasing. “And if it’s collecting, it’ll try to make you pay in the only currency it can carry—something you meant to keep.”

Behind the seam, something shifts as if turning its head. The mortar around it pales a shade, the outline sharpening—more doorway than crack now. The listening lamp responds with a soft, eager thrum, and the air between lamp and seam feels bruised, tense, as if both are tugging on the same thread.

**Status updates:**  
- Seam: confirmed debt-collector  
- Dust-keyhole: steady, aligned toward seam  
- Listening lamp: agitation increasing

### Turn 24 [PLAYER]

I tug my collar higher and take a half-step so I’m slightly behind the lamplighter’s shoulder, keeping the charm extended but angled away from the lamp. “Something I meant to keep—memories? my name? my voice?”  

Then I face the seam and whisper, “Road—tap-code: one for yes, two for no. Will you take *my laugh* if I owe a laugh-debt?” I hover the map-knife spine over the brick without touching, ready to pull back if the doorway widens.

*Agent reasoning: The seam is escalating into a doorway and both it and the lamp feel hungry; I want answers, but I need to slow this down and learn what “payment” means before I get tricked. I’ll probe the lamplighter for specifics and set a strict tap-code with the seam while keeping my voice muffled.*

### Turn 25 [GAME]

You slide half a step behind the lamplighter’s shoulder. He instinctively shifts with you—protective without admitting it—putting his body between your charm-hand and the street while you angle the moth-charm away from his listening lamp. The lamp’s amber hush dims a notch, like a dog denied a scent.

“Something I meant to keep—memories? my name? my voice?” you ask.

The lamplighter answers in a rasp, eyes on the seam, not on you. “All three are collectible. The Court prefers *memories*—clean, legal, rewritable. The Guild prefers *laughs*—fuel. The Hollow prefers what makes you *you*.” He swallows. “Names are easy to hook. Voices… they’re worse. A stolen voice still talks in the dark.”

You face the seam. The moth-charm’s etched lines flare faintly inside their brass, aligning with the dust-keyhole as you whisper your tap-code question. You hover the **spine** of your map-knife near the brick—close enough to feel the seam’s cold breath, not close enough to “sign” anything with a touch.

One tap comes back. Then—after the smallest, savoring pause—**another single tap**, softer, like a second finger joining the first.

The lamplighter stiffens. “It’s saying yes,” he murmurs, “and yes again. It’ll take your laugh if you owe. And if you don’t…” He nods at the eager thrum in his lamp. “It’ll help you *find* a reason you do.”

The seam sharpens into a more definite outline—still closed, but now shaped like a narrow door someone has traced with a wet thumbnail. The mortar around it pales, as if the brick is being erased into an entryway. Your dust-keyhole rotates a fraction and *clicks* into alignment; for a heartbeat, the charm feels heavier, like it wants to be inserted.

From the street behind the lamplighter, a second lantern-glow passes—Guild patrol light, moving slow. The lamplighter subtly angles his body to hide the seam from that line of sight, and keeps his own lamp drawn back, fighting its hunger.

**Status updates:**  
- Seam: “yes” to taking your laugh  
- Door-outline: sharpening, still closed  
- Guild patrol light: approaching nearby

### Turn 26 [PLAYER]

I tuck the moth-charm in against my chest under my coat to dim it, then slide my knife back into its sheath without taking my eyes off the door-outline. In a whisper to the lamplighter: “Get me out of this sightline—now. And while we move: the runner. One detail I can track—scent, limp, accent, anything.”

As we shift, I breathe toward the seam, barely audible: “Road—hold. No opening while the Guild’s eyes are near.”

*Agent reasoning: A Guild patrol is nearby, so I need to avoid being seen while also learning more about the seam and the runner; I’ll de-escalate the door opening, hide the charm, and quietly interrogate the lamplighter for actionable details.*

### Turn 27 [GAME]

You tuck the moth-charm under your coat. The faint brass-warmth dulls immediately, and the etched lines stop flaring—like a face going blank mid-smile. You slide the map-knife home; the tiny *snick* sounds too loud in the damp alley.

The lamplighter reacts fast. He hooks two fingers into the chain of his listening lamp and *pins* it against his hip, muffling its amber hush, then shoulders you left—north along the lantern-maker’s back wall—into a deeper pocket of shadow between stacked crate-lids and a rain barrel that smells of wick-soot.

Behind you, the seam’s door-outline hesitates. Your breathed command—*hold*—doesn’t “obey” like a trained thing, but it does something else: the pale outline stops sharpening. The mortar stays bruised and damp, closed tight, as if it’s listening and choosing to be patient.

Down the street to the east, the approaching Guild patrol-lantern swings into view at the alley mouth. Its light does not cast; it *searches*, lingering where laughter has been lately. It pauses, as if it nearly catches the seam’s taste… then drifts on, pulled by some other hunger.

While you move, the lamplighter answers your question without looking at you. “Runner’s called himself a dozen names, but he’s got one tell: **clove-smoke**—cheap clove oil to cover the smell of bottled laughter. And he drags his right foot when he thinks no one’s watching. Speaks like Quarter-born, but he clips his vowels like a Court scribe trying on a street coat.” He gives you a quick, hard glance. “If you smell clove and sugared rot together, don’t follow into open light. That’s where they net you.”

In your new cover, the air is colder. The wall to your west sweats; the rain barrel’s surface trembles in rings that don’t match any drip. Somewhere nearby, a wind-chime rings a syllable late—your name’s last consonant, softly, like a mistake that learned to talk.

**Status updates:**
- Sightline: broken, concealed
- Seam: outline stalled, closed
- Guild patrol: passing the alley mouth
- Lead on runner: clove-smoke, right-foot drag, clipped vowels

### Turn 28 [PLAYER]

I lean close to the rain barrel and watch the wrong rings, holding my breath to see if they answer *sound*; I tap the barrel’s rim once with a knuckle, then stop. In a whisper to the lamplighter: “Clove-smoke and a dragging right foot—good. Where does he haunt? Bottling-house, tavern, lamp-market?”  

Then I murmur, mostly to myself, “That chime just tried to finish me,” and I press a finger to my throat like a ward. “If the Road can hook names—how do I keep mine from being collected?”

*Agent reasoning: The chime echoing my name feels like the seam testing hooks; I want to investigate the “rings” in the barrel for hidden influence while quietly extracting more specifics from the lamplighter about where to find the runner and the mile-marker.*

### Turn 29 [GAME]

Your knuckle taps the rain barrel once.

The *wrong rings* answer immediately—not by getting louder, but by **reordering themselves**. One tight circle forms dead-center, then a second, then a third, each arriving a heartbeat after your tap as if the water is *listening late* the way the chimes do. When you stop breathing, the rings don’t stop; they slow, then tilt—circles becoming slight ovals that point east, toward the alley mouth the patrol-lantern just passed.

You’re tucked in the shadow-pocket: **west wall sweating cold**, crates to your back, barrel at your knees. The air tastes of damp soot and that faint sugared rot the Hollow leaves on things it’s considered.

The lamplighter leans in close enough that his voice doesn’t travel. “He haunts the **lamp-market** at shift-change—when the Guild’s swapping wicks and nobody admits what they saw on patrol. He sells ‘route-jokes’ to apprentices. But when he bottles—” his eyes flick to the barrel’s answering rings “—he goes under the **Old Tallow Press**, near the drainage runnels. Smell of clove and hot metal. You’ll hear glass clink like teeth.”

The chime in the near distance tries again—soft, one syllable behind—your name’s shape without its full body. The lamplighter’s jaw tightens at your murmured, “That chime just tried to finish me.”

When you press a finger to your throat, it helps—not as magic, but as **discipline**: you stop yourself from reflexively answering to the sound. The lamplighter nods approval, small and grim. “That’s the first trick. Don’t *respond*.”

“At the Guild,” he continues, “we teach three keeps: **don’t say your full name near a listening lamp**, don’t let anyone else say it *for you* near bark-glyphs, and if you must trade a name, trade a **use-name**—something you can afford to lose. The Road hooks what’s repeated. The Court hooks what’s recorded. The Hollow hooks what you *answer to*.”

As he speaks, his own lamp—pinned at his hip—gives a faint, hungry tremor, like it caught the word “trade” and wants in. Farther off, the patrol-lantern’s searching glow slows, as if reconsidering the alley it just passed.

**Status updates:**
- Barrel rings: answering, pointing east  
- Runner lead: lamp-market; Old Tallow Press  
- Name-defense: don’t respond; use-name advised  
- Guild patrol: slowing nearby

### Turn 30 [PLAYER]

I press my ear close to the rain barrel without touching the water and whisper, “Show me the runner—one ring for market, two for Tallow Press,” then go still to listen.  
To the lamplighter, barely moving my lips: “Call me ‘Moth’ only—nothing else. If the patrol turns in, where’s the nearest cut-through that *isn’t* a seam?”

*Agent reasoning: The barrel’s “late-listening” rings feel like a clue worth testing, but the patrol is doubling back, so I should stay quiet and pick a disposable use-name to protect myself while pressing the lamplighter for practical next steps.*

### Turn 31 [GAME]

You bring your ear close to the barrel—close enough to feel its chill, not close enough to kiss the water—and whisper your terms.

**Immediate outcome:** the barrel answers, but not like a tidy oracle.

The surface tightens into **two rings**—clear, deliberate—then a third ring shivers in late, faint and warped, as if something else is trying to “correct” the message after the fact. The two clean rings drift eastward on the surface, pulling the ovals into a direction-line: **Old Tallow Press**. The late third ring doesn’t follow; it collapses inward like a throat swallowing a laugh.

You’re still tucked in the shadow-pocket along the **north wall** of the lantern-maker’s backstreet; behind you, crate-lids press damp wood-smell into your coat, and the wall to the west sweats cold as if it’s nervous.

The lamplighter barely moves his mouth. “Moth,” he confirms—careful, like he’s handling a blade by the dull side. Then, quieter: “Nearest cut-through that isn’t a seam is the **wicker-run** behind the lamp-market stalls. Looks like a dead fence. It isn’t. You push where the wicker’s been patched with **copper wire**—that’s Guild work. It drops you into the ash-steps by the kiln sheds.”

As he speaks, his pinned lamp tremors again—subtle, hungry—drawn toward the idea of a “Guild cut-through.” Down the alley mouth, the patrol-lantern’s searching glow slows to a near-stop; you hear boot leather pause on wet stone, and the faint clink of a wick-tool being adjusted, like someone preparing to look *closer*.

Somewhere farther off, the wind-chime tries your name-shape again—still one syllable late—testing whether you’ll answer. The barrel’s surface gives a tiny, involuntary twitch in the same rhythm, as if sound is making ripples without touching water.

**Status updates:**
- Barrel sign: **Two rings → Tallow Press**
- Interference: **late third ring**
- Cut-through learned: **wicker-run (copper patch)**
- Patrol: **paused, listening**

### Turn 32 [PLAYER]

I clamp a hand over my own mouth and signal the lamplighter with two fingers: *move, now*—then I ease away from the barrel and start a slow, silent creep toward the wicker-run, eyes scanning for any copper-wire patch. As we go, I tug my coat tighter over the moth-charm and, without speaking, point once at his pinned lamp like a warning to keep it muffled; if the patrol turns in, I freeze flat to the wall and let them pass rather than run.

*Agent reasoning: The patrol is listening and my name is being baited; I should avoid speaking, move quietly to the wicker-run escape, and keep the lamplighter’s hungry lamp from drawing attention. I also want to note that “third ring” interference for later.*

### Turn 33 [GAME]

You clamp your hand over your mouth and signal. The lamplighter doesn’t argue—he shifts his pinned lamp tighter under his coat and turns his body sideways to slip past the crates without scraping them.

**Immediate outcome:** you make it out of the barrel’s little “listening pocket” and start edging north along the back wall toward the lamp-market’s rear fencing. Your caution pays off: no running, no breathy name-sounds, no jangling tools.

The patrol chooses that moment to commit. The searching amber glow swings into the alley mouth behind you, and bootsteps enter—measured, not hurried. The light *listens* along the stonework, lingering where the seam had been earlier as if tasting for a bruise in the mortar.

You flatten to the wall when it turns in. The stone is wet-cold against your cheek; the cartouche-ink smell of sap and old paper is stronger here, as if the trees’ legal scribbles have been rubbed into the masonry.

The lamplighter freezes with you, shoulder to shoulder. In the thin gap between his coat and his pinned lamp, you hear the lamp’s hush grow eager. He presses his forearm across it—muffling it hard. In a near-silent rasp he offers, “Good. Let them *think* we’re a crack in the wall.”

The patrol-lantern pauses ten paces away. You catch a fragment of their low talk: “—bottled laughter residue… Quarter stink—” and then the sound of a wick-tool scraping glass. The listening glow swells, probing the air.

Your coat tightens over the moth-charm; it warms once, faintly, like it’s trying to flare its hidden lines—then goes still under the pressure, obedient to concealment.

When the patrol’s attention slides toward the rain barrel behind you—drawn by those wrong rings you woke—its glow *lingers there* instead of on your flattened bodies. That gives you your gap.

You creep again. Ahead, the rear of the lamp-market shows as a sagging **wicker fence**, patched in places with twine and scrap. Your eyes pick out the tell: a fist-sized mend stitched with **copper wire**—too neat, too deliberate, catching even the weak ambient light with a dull penny gleam.

The lamplighter exhales through his nose only. “There,” he breathes without voice. “Push on the copper. Don’t pull.”

Behind you, the patrol’s light shifts away from the barrel, dissatisfied, and begins to sweep back toward the wall—closer now, as if it’s realized the alley has *too few sounds*.

**Status updates:**
- Patrol: entered alley, sweeping closer  
- Wicker-run: copper patch located  
- Lamplighter lamp: fully muffled  
- Moth-charm: warmth suppressed

### Turn 34 [PLAYER]

I slide up to the copper-wire patch and press my palm flat against it, pushing steady—no jerks—then slip through the moment it gives, tugging the lamplighter after me by his sleeve. Once we’re on the other side, I crouch low and glance back at the wicker to see if it “re-seals” or leaves a telltale gap for the patrol to notice.

*Agent reasoning: The patrol is sweeping closer; the wicker-run is our best non-seam escape. I’m curious but survival-first—push through now, keep silent, and try to learn how this cut-through works without drawing lamp-attention.*

### Turn 35 [GAME]

Your palm finds the copper-wire patch—cool, slightly greasy—and you **push steady**. The wicker doesn’t creak like a fence; it gives like a **ribcage** making room. The copper stitches flex, then slip aside, and a narrow dark gap opens just wide enough for shoulders.

**Immediate outcome:** you and the lamplighter slip through cleanly. No snap, no tear, no obvious break.

On the other side you land in a low service lane behind the lamp-market: **ash-steps** drop away to the east toward kiln sheds, and the air smells of spent tallow and wet clinker. A thin runnel of water crawls along the curb—moving the wrong way for the slope, as if embarrassed to be seen.

You crouch and look back.

The wicker **re-seals** almost politely. The copper wire tightens on its own, drawing the patch flush until it looks like nothing more than an old mend. The only “tell” is subtler: a faint, fresh **penny-smear** on the copper where your palm pressed, and a slight change in weave direction that only someone already hunting that exact trick would notice.

Behind the fence, the patrol-lantern’s glow washes across the alley, then pauses—close now. You hear a tool tap stone, and a voice mutter, “Too quiet. Quarter’s holding its breath.” The listening light lingers a heartbeat longer than comfort, but it doesn’t swing to the fence; it’s still distracted by the barrel’s earlier wrongness.

The lamplighter, breathing shallow, tucks his pinned lamp deeper and murmurs without shaping his lips much, “Good hands, Moth. That patch forgets you if you don’t fight it.” Then, tighter: “Don’t let my lamp hear the kiln-sheds. It likes hot places.”

From farther downslope, a kiln door groans and a chain clinks—someone working late, or something pretending to. The chime that’s been trailing your name doesn’t stop; it’s fainter here, but it has followed the *direction* of your heartbeat rather than your footsteps.

**Status updates:**
- Wicker-run: resealed, minimal tell  
- Location: ash-steps behind lamp-market  
- Patrol: searching alley, not through yet  
- Kiln sheds: activity audible nearby

### Turn 36 [PLAYER]

I tug the lamplighter down into a deeper crouch and gesture two fingers downward—*stay low*—then point at the runnel flowing the wrong way and trace its line with my fingertip in the air, asking silently if he knows why it does that. Keeping my mouth shut, I edge a few steps down the ash-steps toward the kiln sheds, stopping at each new shadow to listen for that chain and sniff for clove-smoke. If the chime tries my name-shape again, I click my tongue once—an ugly, meaningless sound—like spitting a hook out, and keep moving without looking back.

*Agent reasoning: The patrol might still find the cut-through, and the lamplighter’s lamp is tempted by the kiln heat; I want to investigate the wrong-way runnel and the kiln activity while keeping us hidden and quiet, and also probe the name-chime problem without speaking my true name.*

### Turn 37 [GAME]

You tug the lamplighter down; he drops with you, knees whispering in ash. At your gesture toward the runnel, he follows the backward-flow with narrowed eyes and gives a tiny, tight shake of his head—then taps two knuckles to his own breastbone and draws a short line in the air *uphill*, like he’s indicating **“not water—pull.”** In a breath-thin murmur that barely scuffs the air: “Kiln-sheds vent into old drains. Something under the Quarter drinks wrong. Guild says ‘pressure.’ Court says ‘property.’ I say: don’t step in it.”

**Immediate outcome:** you move downslope without giving the patrol anything to catch—no spoken name, no sudden sprint. Your shadow-to-shadow pauses let the lane’s small sounds separate: the chain clink isn’t random; it repeats in a work rhythm—lift, drag, settle—coming from the **second kiln shed on the right**, where a door sits a finger-width ajar.

Sensory grounding: the ash-steps descend east; behind you, the wicker fence is a dark seam in the market’s back. The air here tastes of damp soot and old fat, and your boots leave faint prints that dull quickly as ash re-settles.

The chime tries your name-shape again—late, hungry for your head to turn. You click your tongue once, ugly and meaningless. The sound lands wrong in the lane, like a pebble thrown into cloth. For a beat, the chime stutters—misses its “late syllable”—and then drops into a different pattern, not your name at all: a **simple three-note knock** that matches the chain’s rhythm.

The lamplighter flinches at that, eyes flicking to the ajar kiln door. He presses his pinned lamp harder under his coat; the lamp’s hush bruises the fabric from inside, eager for heat. “Careful,” he mouths more than says. “If that’s Choir work, it’ll try to tune you. If it’s Guild, it’ll try to invoice you.”

You sniff for clove-smoke. It’s there—faint, threaded through tallow-stink—like someone trying to **mask** the smell of burned wick with spice. And under it, something else: wet paper, fresh-ink sap… Cartouche Court scent, out of place this close to kilns.

Up the steps behind, the patrol-lantern’s sweep doesn’t vanish; it dims, muffled by walls, but you hear the boots hesitate at the market fence line—someone close enough that a bad scrape or a cough would matter.

**Status updates:**
- Patrol: near fence line  
- Chain rhythm: from ajar kiln door  
- Chime: shifted to 3-note knock  
- Clove-smoke: faint, masking scent

### Turn 38 [PLAYER]

I grip the lamplighter’s sleeve once—*stay back*—and creep to the second kiln door, keeping my steps off the wrong-flow runnel. At arm’s length I pause, then scratch a different pattern—four faint taps—on the kiln’s stone jamb to break the three-note knock, and lean in to sniff and listen through the crack without opening it yet. If I hear a voice or glass clink, I whisper, “Runner?”—barely breath—and ready my moth-charm under my coat like a blindfold for my name.

*Agent reasoning: The ajar kiln door + clove-smoke + Court-ink scent feels like the runner’s trail and a bigger conspiracy; I want to investigate without alerting patrol, and I’m wary of the “tuning” knock, so I’ll approach quietly, disrupt the rhythm, and try to get a look/listen inside while keeping our lamps muffled.*

### Turn 39 [GAME]

You pinch the lamplighter’s sleeve—*stay back*—and he obeys, sinking into the soot-shadow between two stacked clinker baskets. He keeps his coat clamped over his pinned lamp, jaw tight, eyes on the fence line uphill.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** you reach the second kiln door without stepping in the wrong-way runnel. Your four faint taps land on the stone jamb like dry insects. The three-note knock that had been threading the air **breaks**—not silenced, but forced to hesitate, as if it lost its place in a song.

You lean to the crack.

**Sensory grounding:** you’re on the ash-steps’ right side, shoulder near the kiln shed; the ajar door leaks a thin stripe of orange-gray heat-light onto the soot.

Inside, you catch **glass clink**—careful, deliberate—followed by the soft hiss of a stopper being seated. Clove-smoke is stronger here, but it’s been burned too hot, sharp at the back of your throat. Under it, that wet-paper sap-ink scent persists, like a legal document left too close to flame.

A voice answers your presence without fully committing to speech—someone trying not to be overheard: “—heard three, got four. Not Guild code.” A pause. Then, closer to the crack: “Say the word.”

You whisper, barely breath: “Runner?”

For a heartbeat, silence. Then the chain inside gives a single **settling clink**, and the voice murmurs, “Moth?”—not quite your name, but shaped like it.

You ready the moth-charm under your coat like a blindfold. It warms against your ribs, not lighting—just **drinking sound**, dulling the edges of that almost-name so it doesn’t hook properly in the air. The three-note knock outside doesn’t find you again; it slides off into the lane like a dropped tune.

The lamplighter shifts behind you, tense. He mouths: “If they bottle in there, don’t let them see my lamp. It’ll… answer.”

From uphill, the patrol’s boots scrape near the market fence. A muted lantern-hush swells and then tightens, as if they’re listening for exactly the kind of small, human mistake you’re refusing to make.

The kiln door crack widens a hair from the inside—just enough for an eye-line. You don’t see the eye, only the glint of something like **a lens** held close, and a soft, amused exhale. “One question,” the voice says. “Are you being followed by light, or by law?”

**Status updates:**
- Kiln shed: occupied, cautious voice
- Moth-charm: muffling near-name hook
- Patrol: at fence line, listening close

### Turn 40 [PLAYER]

I keep my mouth close to the crack and breathe, “Both—light that listens, and law that pretends it doesn’t.” Then I add, “You said ‘bottle’—what are you sealing in there, and who taught you my almost-name?”

*Agent reasoning: The voice inside is testing me; I’ll answer truthfully but vaguely to avoid giving hooks, and I want more info about the lens, the bottles, and why they almost-named me. Also the patrol is close, so I should keep it quiet and avoid revealing the lamplighter’s lamp.*

### Turn 41 [GAME]

Your breath slips through the crack with the words—*both*—and the lens-glint inside goes still, like you’ve put a finger on a bruise.

**Immediate outcome:** the person inside answers—quiet, fast, and more honestly than they meant to.

“Good,” they murmur. “Then you’ll understand why I’m not opening this.”

A glass bottle clinks again, closer to the door, and you hear the faintest sound inside it that shouldn’t fit in glass: a tiny, delayed **chuckle**, like laughter remembered by a throat that isn’t there.

“We’re sealing **laugh**,” the voice says. “Not jokes. Not joy. The Hollow’s surplus—what leaks off safe routes when the lamps drink too deep.” Another careful inhale. “Clove keeps the bottle from learning your breath.”

At your second question—*who taught you my almost-name*—the lens shifts, catching the kiln’s heat-light in a thin crescent. “The trees,” they say, and there’s a bitterness under it. “Cartouche Court scribes came through the sheds two nights ago with sap-ink and a polite warrant. They asked for ‘Moth’ like they were asking directions. When I didn’t know it, they wrote it on my tongue anyway—almost-right so it would snag you, not them.”

Behind you, downhill air pulls cold; uphill, the patrol-lantern hush swells, then tightens—boots scraping closer along the fence line as if they’ve found the *idea* of a voice and are triangulating it.

The lamplighter in the shadow makes a tiny, involuntary sound—half warning, half disgust. He mouths, barely: “Court’s been writing on people. Knew it.”

Inside the kiln shed, chain links drag once—someone shifting a crate or a hooked bar. The voice lowers further. “If you’re carrying a charm that eats names, keep it fed. They’ve got a listening lamp up there, and a bark-writ waiting to certify you into absence.”

A pause, then a small, practical offer wrapped in fear: “I can slide you one bottle—unmarked. It’ll buy you a minute of darkness if a lamp corners you. But if you say my almost-name back at me, I’ll choke on it.”

**Status updates:**
- Kiln shed: bottling Hollow-laugh  
- Cartouche Court: “almost-name” hook used  
- Patrol-lantern: closing on voices

### Turn 42 [PLAYER]

I whisper, “Don’t worry—I won’t throw your almost-name back at you.” Then, barely louder than breath: “Slide the bottle. How do I use it—crack the seal, smash it, or just carry it open?”  

I flick two fingers toward the lamplighter in the shadows—*ready, now*—and keep my shoulder tight to the kiln door, eyes up the ash-steps for the patrol’s glow. “And the bark-writ—where do they ‘certify’ someone into absence? Court office, tree-gate, or a lamp-post?”

*Agent reasoning: We’re about to get caught; the bottle sounds useful, and the Court’s “almost-name” trick is a lead I want to understand. I’ll accept the bottle quietly, ask how to use it, and signal the lamplighter to be ready to move.*

### Turn 43 [GAME]



### Turn 44 [PLAYER]

I keep my mouth at the crack. “I won’t speak your almost-name back at you—promise. Slide the bottle, and tell me: do I crack the seal, smash it, or just carry it open when the lamp corners us?”  

I flick two fingers toward the lamplighter in the shadows—*ready*—and press my shoulder to the kiln door, eyes angled up the ash-steps for patrol glow. “And this bark-writ—where do they certify someone into absence? Court office, a tree-gate, or at a lamp-post?”

*Agent reasoning: We’re mid-standoff at the kiln door with patrol closing; I want the bottle and practical instructions, and I’m deeply curious about where the Court “certifies” people into absence so I can map/avoid it.*

### Turn 45 [GAME]

The chain inside whispers, and something small slides across the threshold: a squat glass bottle wrapped in clove-stained twine. It bumps your boot once—gentle, deliberate—then stops. The kiln door doesn’t open any wider.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** you get the bottle into your palm without exposing the lamplighter or yourself. Uphill, the patrol’s listening glow *pauses*—as if it heard glass touch stone—but it doesn’t commit to a rush yet.

**Sensory grounding:** you’re still pinned to the kiln door on the right side of the ash-steps; the bottle is warm from kiln-heat and faintly vibrates, like a laugh trying to remember how to be a sound.

The voice inside speaks into the crack, clipped and urgent. “Don’t carry it open. Don’t sip it. Don’t *breathe* it. If a lamp corners you—**smash it low**, near their feet. The laugh spills like fog and makes light… hesitate. It won’t blind them. It makes them *second-guess what they heard*.” A half-beat. “If you crack the seal, it learns your mouth. Then it follows you.”

Your two-finger signal lands; in the shadow, the lamplighter shifts his stance, shoulders squaring. He draws his pinned lamp closer to his ribs like it’s a sleeping animal that might wake.

At your question about the bark-writ, the lens inside tilts; you catch a sliver of reflection—ink-dark fingers, a paper-thin strip of bark used like a warrant. “Not the Court office,” the voice says. “Too many witnesses. They do it at a **tree-gate**—where the cartouches are thick and the roots drink names. There’s one near the listening lamp you mentioned… the iron gate quarter? They call it ‘authentication.’ They press the writ to the bark and read you out loud until the tree agrees you were never said right.”

Uphill, boots scrape again—closer now. A lantern hush swells, then tightens into a narrow beam sliding down the ash-steps, searching for the *shape* of conversation.

The voice adds, softer: “If they ask for ‘Moth’ and you answer, you help the writ. Make them say it first.”

**Status updates:**
- Unmarked laugh-bottle: acquired  
- Patrol lantern-beam: probing downslope  
- Bark-writ site: tree-gate “authentication”

### Turn 46 [PLAYER]

I tuck the clove-wrapped bottle deep into my inner pocket and whisper into the crack, “Thank you. If you need a map that lies to lamps, leave a four-tap at this jamb.” Then I peel away from the door, catch the lamplighter’s sleeve, and guide him downslope into the deepest soot-shadow, keeping our mouths shut and our steps off the wrong-flow runnel while I watch the patrol beam’s edge for a gap to slip through.

*Agent reasoning: The patrol beam is closing in, so I need to disengage quietly. I’m curious about the bottler and the tree-gate, but survival first; I’ll also plant a hook for later contact.*

### Turn 47 [GAME]

Your whisper into the crack earns you a single answer: four soft taps from inside—careful, like someone practicing a knock they’ll need later. Then the chain goes still.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** you and the lamplighter slip downslope into the soot-shadow without speaking, and the patrol beam *misses* you by a breath—washing the kiln door, the ash-steps, the wrong-flow runnel… then gliding past as if disappointed it can’t find a mouth to accuse.

**Sensory grounding:** you’re now two switchbacks below the kiln shed, pressed into a seam where soot has caked thick as felt; the air tastes of burnt wick and cold iron, and the uphill brook’s giggle is muffled here, like laughter under a pillow.

The lamplighter moves the way a man moves around his own lantern: protective, resentful. He keeps his lamp hugged tight, shuttered, and leans close enough to speak without sound—just breath against your sleeve. “Good. No words. The listening ones bite *syllables* first.”

Above, the patrol’s glow splits—one beam combing the steps, another probing the fence line. You catch a flicker of brass at the corner of your eye: a **Guild lantern** mounted on a post farther up is “listening,” its light bruising the air in slow pulses, as if it’s tasting for names. Each pulse makes the chimes in the distance ring one note late.

Downslope, in the deeper alley-mouth, someone is already there: a bundled figure hauling a sack of cullet-glass. They freeze when the beam sweeps, then deliberately drags the sack across stone—*scrape, scrape*—throwing a louder sound uphill to pull attention away from where you crouch. They don’t look at you. They just keep scraping until the patrol beam follows the noise like a dog.

The lamplighter’s jaw tightens. A warning, almost a confession: “Court and Guild both pay in favors. Some folks spend them to keep breathing.”

**Status updates:**
- Patrol beam: diverted upslope  
- Kiln contact: four-tap signal set  
- Unmarked bottle: secured  

```json
{"inventory_add":[],"inventory_remove":[],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":["Soot-seam switchback (below kiln shed)"],"npcs_add":["Bundled cullet-hauler (unknown allegiance)"]}
```

### Turn 48 [PLAYER]

I squeeze the lamplighter’s sleeve—*stay quiet*—then crouch low and edge toward the bundled cullet-hauler, keeping to the soot-thick seam. When I’m close enough not to shout, I tap my own chest once and give a small two-finger salute of thanks, then whisper, “Why help?” and hold still for their answer.

*Agent reasoning: The cullet-hauler just saved us by drawing the patrol—my curiosity wants to know who they are and why they helped, but I should keep silent and cautious because of the listening lanterns.*

### Turn 49 [GAME]

You slide along the soot-thick seam and close the last few feet without drawing the patrol’s attention. The cullet-hauler keeps scraping until the uphill beam commits—then, the moment it turns away, they stop dead, like a puppet with the string cut.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** your whisper reaches them; they don’t bolt, and they answer—quietly—without turning their head.

You’re crouched just downslope of the ash-steps’ bend, the kiln shed behind and above you; soot clings to your knees like velvet. The wrong-flow runnel murmurs nearby, water ticking uphill over slag.

The bundled figure shifts their weight and lets the sack settle. A gloved hand rises, not to threaten, but to show you something: a thumb with a faint **cartouche-burn** on it—pale ink scarred into skin. Their voice is rough, careful. “Because I’ve been… *certified wrong* once. Court pressed bark to my name and the tree tried to forget my face. Guild lamp found me anyway. I learned which lie keeps you breathing.”

They finally glance at you—only a sliver of eye through the wrap. “You’re Moth. They’re bottling laughs in your name. That’s why the lamps are hungry. If they catch you, they’ll make you sign the bottle-work so it looks voluntary.”

Behind you, in the deeper soot-shadow, the lamplighter stays where you left him—silent, but tense. His shuttered lamp gives off a faint, involuntary pulse, as if it dislikes being ignored.

Uphill, the patrol beam lingers on the kiln door a heartbeat too long, then drifts toward the fence line again. The hauler’s voice drops further. “Tree-gate’s worse at night. Cartouches re-ink around shadows—if you step wrong, you’ll walk out with a *new past*. If you go, go before the chimes start tuning. They’ll be out soon.”

A tiny sound punctuates it: somewhere close, a wind-chime rings one note late—like it’s testing whether you’ll answer.

**Status updates:**
- Cullet-hauler: Court-burned, informed
- Patrol beam: sweeping back downslope
- Tree-gate: dangerous after dark

### Turn 50 [PLAYER]

I give the hauler a sharp nod and whisper, “What lie—exactly? A false route, a false name, or a false light?” Then I hook two fingers at the lamplighter—*come*—and start easing all three of us downslope toward cover, adding under my breath, “If you know a safe approach to the tree-gate before the chimes tune, show me with your feet—no talking.”

*Agent reasoning: The hauler knows about the tree-gate and “lies” that keep you alive; I want specifics, but the patrol beam is coming back, so I need to move us while extracting actionable details.*

### Turn 51 [GAME]



*Triggered: guard_Tree-gate Before The_1_458686, fail_Tree-gate Before The_1_1aa68c*

### Turn 52 [PLAYER]

I whisper to the hauler, “What lie—exactly? False route, false name, or false light?” Then I crook two fingers at the lamplighter—*come*—and begin easing downslope into thicker cover, adding under my breath to the hauler, “If you know a safe approach to the tree-gate before the chimes tune, show me with your feet—no talking.”

*Agent reasoning: The hauler might know a specific trick that works on listening lamps, but the patrol beam is coming back—so I need the answer fast and then move, preferably letting the hauler lead silently toward the tree-gate before the chimes shift.*

### Turn 53 [GAME]

The hauler answers your whisper with a single, decisive motion: they lift three fingers—route, name, light—then fold down **route** and **light**, leaving **one finger** raised.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the “lie” is a **false name**. Not shouted, not written—*carried*. As you ease downslope, the hauler starts walking immediately, showing you the approach with their feet just as you asked. The lamplighter comes when you crook your fingers, keeping a half-step behind you, lamp still shuttered.

Soot deepens as you descend; the seam narrows between a slag wall on your right and a sagging fence on your left. Every time the patrol beam sweeps above, the soot on your boots throws a faint moth-dust shimmer that fades when you try to focus on it.

The hauler’s pace is steady, deliberate—no hesitation, no looking back. They touch their own throat once (a “don’t speak”) and then tap the cartouche-burn on their thumb: **Court listens through labels**. Their raised finger circles in the air, then points at you, then at the dark ahead—*you will wear the wrong name to pass*.

Behind you, the lamplighter makes a small, angry sound in his nose—almost a laugh swallowed. He leans close enough that his breath grazes your ear. “Names stick to lantern-glass,” he murmurs, barely there. “Careful what you borrow.”

Upslope, the patrol beam returns—closer now—snagging on the fence posts. For a moment, a hanging lantern you don’t remember being there brightens like an ear catching a secret; its amber hush tightens, and the air feels faintly bruised.

Downslope, the hauler guides you into a side-cut where the ground dips and the fog tastes sweeter—sugared rot. Ahead, through the murk, the first **tree-gate** silhouettes: two living trunks bent toward each other, bark ink shifting around the space between them as if rehearsing a verdict.

A wind-chime somewhere rings *almost* your name—one syllable late—then stops, listening back.

**Status updates:**
- Lie identified: **false name**
- Patrol beam: sweeping closer
- Approach begun: side-cut to tree-gate

*Triggered: guard_Tree-gate Before The_1_458686, fail_Tree-gate Before The_1_1aa68c, watcher_Tree-gate Before The_1_1c8bd4*

### Turn 54 [PLAYER]

I pinch a bit of soot and mark a quick, false initial on my own wrist like it’s a name-tag, then show it to the hauler with a questioning tilt—*this how?* I glance back at the lamplighter and whisper, “Give me a name you’ve seen lamps swallow—something common enough to pass,” then gesture for both of them to keep low as we approach the bent trunks without stepping into the ink-shifted bark-shadow.

*Agent reasoning: The tree-gate is close and dangerous, and the hauler says we need a false name; I want to learn how to “wear” it without speaking and also check the lamplighter’s reaction before we step into the cartouche-ink.*

### Turn 55 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Your soot-initial “takes”—not as ink, but as *permission to be mistaken*. The hauler gives you a sharp, approving nod and mirrors you: they smear a crooked mark on their own wrist, then press two fingers to their lips again.

You’re in the side-cut just downslope of the kiln-fence, fog pooling ankle-high. Ahead, the bent trunks of the tree-gate lean together like a held breath; the bark’s pale cartouches keep re-writing around the gap, trying to decide what you are.

The lamplighter, crouched and tight-shouldered, answers your whisper with a name that sounds like it’s been said a thousand times into glass: **“Hobb.”** He spits it softly into his palm first—an old habit—then adds, “Lamps swallow it easy. Too common to choke on.” His shuttered lantern gives a small, hungry *tick* at the name, like a tongue clicking.

The hauler points at your wrist, then makes a tiny “H” in the air—confirming. Then they demonstrate the approach with their feet: not straight at the gate, but *along the roots that climb the trunk*, weight kept off the inviting moss. They move like someone who’s been corrected by trees before—hands on bark, boots finding ridges, never committing a full step onto the soft, flat patches.

As you edge closer, the gate’s shadow isn’t a normal shadow—it’s a smear that tries to crawl up your shins. The cartouches on the bark briefly twist into something resembling your real name, then hesitate, as if offended by the soot-mark’s audacity.

Above and behind, the patrol beam sweeps again, briefly whitening the fence slats. The listening-lantern you felt earlier brightens somewhere upslope—attentive, bruising the air with its hush—then dims, as if it lost the thread.

A wind-chime rings once, one syllable late—*“...Moth.”* The lateness feels deliberate.

**Status updates:**
- False name adopted: “Hobb”
- Tree-gate: cartouches hesitating

### Turn 56 [PLAYER]

I press two fingers to the soot-mark on my wrist and whisper, “Hobb,” like a prayer I don’t believe in, then step exactly where the hauler stepped—hands on bark, boots on root-ridges, avoiding the soft moss. As we pass the tightest bend of the trunks, I angle my eyes to read the cartouches without staring, and I silently mouth my real name behind my teeth—no sound—watching if the bark reacts anyway.

*Agent reasoning: The gate is trying to rewrite me, so I’ll commit to the false name and follow the hauler’s precise footwork; I also want to learn what the gate “wants” by watching the cartouches closely, but I can’t risk speaking my real name.*

### Turn 57 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** The tree-gate *accepts* “Hobb” long enough to let you through—then tries to bill you for it.

Two fingers on the soot-mark, your whisper slips into the gap like a coin into a slot. The cartouches along the bent trunks twitch, re-ink, and briefly settle into tidy, bland glyphwork—official-looking, satisfied. Your boots find the same root-ridges the hauler used; your palms press damp bark that feels like cold leather over bone. The soft moss you avoid stirs anyway, offended, as if it wanted your weight.

At the tightest bend, you angle your eyes and read without staring. The cartouches are not a map so much as a verdict: *HOBB, TRAVELER, PERMITTED (TEMP.)*—and beneath it, thinner, meaner strokes: *NAME OWED.*

You mouth **Eldrin Vale** behind your teeth—no sound.

The bark reacts.

Not with letters—worse: with *absence*. A moth-shaped negative space in the cartouches refuses to settle, like someone erased the idea of ink there. Your skin prickles, lies turning itchy under your collarbone. For a heartbeat, a faint, non-listening light leaks from that outline—no glow, just clarity—and you see an **unwritten bypass** above the roots: handholds in the trunk’s crooks leading along the gate’s “shoulder,” a way through that doesn’t ask your name at all.

The hauler freezes mid-step, eyes flicking to that same blank moth-outline. They don’t speak, but their shoulders go tight with recognition—*they’ve seen this before*.

Behind you, the lamplighter’s shuttered lantern gives a small, hungry *tick* at the soundless shape of your real name. He mutters, almost reverent, “That’s Court-work… or Court-fear.” Then, quieter: “If you keep wearing ‘Hobb,’ don’t wear it long. Names left on bark come back wrong.”

Somewhere upslope, the listening-lantern hush bruises the air again—closer, searching. You’re through the tightest bend now, but the ink-shadow still tries to lick at your heels like a clerk’s quill testing wet wax.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re just inside the tree-gate, downslope and slightly east of the kiln-fence line; fog beads on your lashes, and the bark smells of sap and old paper.

### Turn 58 [PLAYER]

I catch the hauler’s eye and point at the moth-shaped blank, then at them—silent question—before I smear my wrist-mark half-away with my thumb like I’m trying not to “leave” Hobb behind. To the lamplighter I whisper, “How do we pay a name-debt without losing a life?” and I edge toward the handholds of the unwritten bypass, keeping my body between the others and the gate-shadow while I listen for that bruising hush coming closer.

*Agent reasoning: The “name owed” feels dangerous, and that moth-outline bypass might be a way to slip the debt; I also want to know why the hauler recognized it and whether the listening-lantern is closing in.*

### Turn 59 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Smearing the soot-mark half-away works like wiping a bootprint off wet clay—enough to make it *uncertain*, not enough to erase the debt. The cartouches on the bent trunks ripple, and the ink-shadow that was licking at your heels hesitates, as if it lost the exact spelling of what to collect.

The hauler meets your eye. When you point at the moth-blank and then at them, they answer with a small, grim gesture: two taps to their own wrist, then a thumb dragged across their throat—not a threat. A warning. *Names taken wrong can cut you later.* They then point to the braided roots under the gate’s “shoulder,” where bone-and-iron chimes hang low like teeth.

As you edge toward the handholds, keeping your body between the others and the shadow, the **bruising hush** swells—closer, to the west and upslope—like a lantern leaning in to overhear. The air tightens around your ribs.

The lamplighter crouches, eyes narrowed, voice nearly nothing. “You don’t ‘pay’ the Court with blood. You pay with **proof** or **substitution**. Proof you’re not the name they think you are—hard without a writ. Substitution… you leave a name that’s already been swallowed.” He glances at your wrist, then at his own throat. “A lamplighter can donate a name. It comes back… dim. But alive.”

At the corridor’s narrowest point—right where your next handhold would take you—fog gathers into a **ring of hanging chimes** that weren’t there a breath ago. They sway without wind, tuned to the pulse in your wrists. One chime rings *wrong* on purpose, and the rest answer it, trying to pull your breathing into their rhythm.

Under the braided roots, your angled gaze catches a small, stoppered **glass vial** wedged against the bone-chime cord: a Wickward bottle, neatly labeled **“INTEREST”** with a polite date. Inside is a contained giggle, faint as a trapped moth.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** Just inside the tree-gate, the bypass handholds rise along the right trunk; the fog tastes of burnt wick and sugared rot.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- “Hobb” mark: smudged, unstable  
- Off-key chime ring: emerged, resonating

### Turn 60 [PLAYER]

I hold up a clenched fist to freeze both of them, then slide my fingers under the braided root and carefully work the stoppered vial free without letting it clink. I tilt it to read the date and label again, then whisper to the lamplighter, “What is this—Court interest, or someone’s?” and, keeping my breath shallow and off the chime-rhythm, I test the nearest hanging chime with a fingernail-soft touch to find the “wrong” one.

*Agent reasoning: The chimes feel like a trap keyed to breath and pulse; the “INTEREST” bottle looks like a clue or tool, and I want to learn what it does before committing to the bypass. I also need to keep the others safe and quiet while the hush closes in.*

### Turn 61 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Your fist stops them cold. The hauler locks in place like a statue that’s learned stillness the hard way; the lamplighter clamps his lantern shutter tighter, jaw working.

You ease your fingers under the braided root and work the vial free. No clink—just a soft kiss of glass on wet bark. The stoppered giggle inside bumps once against its own prison and then goes quiet, as if it realized it’s being overheard.

Tilted in the thin, non-listening clarity of the moth-blank, the label reads cleanly:

**INTEREST**  
**DUE: next week**  
and beneath, in a smaller hand that makes your teeth itch—because it resembles *your* neat cartographer script—an initial: **E.V.**

The lamplighter’s eyes snag on that. His whisper is raw. “That’s Wickward glass. Court doesn’t bottle—Court *records*. Guild bottles. ‘Interest’ means they think someone owes laughter on a debt.” He swallows. “Next week means it’s scheduled to be collected… or to hatch.”

Behind you, the bruising hush swells again—closer than before, a listening lantern sweeping the treeline just outside the gate, trying to find the seam by sound rather than sight. The cartouches on the trunk tighten their strokes, as if bracing for inspection.

You keep your breath shallow and off the rhythm and touch the nearest chime with a fingernail-soft test. Most answer politely—clean notes that try to align with your pulse. Then you find the **wrong** one: it rings a fraction *too late*, like the chime that spoke your name late. When it sounds, the fog around it dimples inward, revealing a hairline gap in the hanging ring—an off-beat “hinge” in the chime-circle.

The hauler, still frozen, points without moving their feet: two fingers toward that wrong chime, then toward the bypass handholds—*yes, that’s the seam.*

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** Inside the tree-gate’s right trunk “shoulder,” the bypass handholds rise above you; upslope west, the searching hush presses closer through fog.

### Turn 62 [PLAYER]

I slip the “INTEREST” vial into my inner pocket and press a finger to the **wrong** chime to still it mid-sway, then look at the lamplighter hard. “E.V.—that’s my hand. Who in the Guild would bottle laughter under my initials?”  

Without waiting, I guide the hauler through the hairline gap at the off-beat hinge and start up the bypass handholds, motioning the lamplighter to follow tight and quiet behind me, keeping my breathing deliberately out of the chime-rhythm as the bruising hush searches outside.

*Agent reasoning: The wrong chime is a hinge/seam and the listening hush is closing in, so I should move us through fast—but the “E.V.” on the vial is a personal hook I can’t ignore, so I’ll pocket it and ask one sharp question while acting.*

### Turn 63 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** The moment your finger stills the wrong chime, the whole ring goes quiet—too quiet—like a choir holding its breath. The hairline gap at the off-beat hinge *widens* just enough to slip a body through without scraping bone-cords. You usher the hauler first; they slide through sideways, eyes down, moving like they’ve paid for silence before.

Outside the gate, the bruising hush swells and drifts past—close enough that the bark vibrates. A shuttered lantern-beam needles the fog, searching for the *sound* of a name being spoken. Your off-rhythm breathing helps; the listening light doesn’t “catch” your lungs.

You start up the bypass handholds. The bark here is oddly unmarred—unwritten. Your fingers find purchase in crooks that feel pre-made for hands.

The lamplighter follows tight, and when you hit him with the question—*who would bottle laughter under E.V.?*—he flinches like you slapped his lantern. “Foreman Morrow signs Guild debts with his own stamp,” he whispers, climbing. “But *tallymen* mark collections with initials—so the blame can walk away if the bottle breaks.” He glances back through the gap, voice turning smaller. “There’s one who’d do it neat. Hush Brine. Measures mouths. Loves clean letters. He’s been asking after ‘Moth’—said it like it was a wick he wanted to pinch.”

As you crest the first bend of the bypass, you see why the Court hates it: the cartouches thin out up here, and the tree’s “legal ink” can’t quite reach. But something else can—threads of fog snag on unseen hooks, forming a faint face-shape that smiles without opening.

Below, the searching hush pauses at the gate’s throat. The listening lantern lingers, confused, then swings away—yet the air stays tense, as if it left a question hanging.

The hauler, ahead of you now, presses a palm to their chest twice—*thank you*—then points upslope toward a darker seam where the bypass rejoins the interior path, away from the official bend.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re midway up the right-trunk bypass, above the chime ring; west and downslope, the lantern-hush combs the fog just outside the tree-gate.

**STATUS UPDATES**

### Turn 64 [PLAYER]

I pause on the handholds and stare at the fog-smile just long enough to map its “hooks,” then whisper, “Are you Court, tree, or something that lives in the gaps?”  

To the lamplighter, I murmur, “Hush Brine—where does he keep his ledgers, and what does he trade for a person’s laugh?” Then I glance to the hauler and quietly ask, “You’ve dealt with Brine before—yes? What did he take from you?”

*Agent reasoning: The fog-face and the mention of Hush Brine feel like separate mysteries; I want to probe both while we still have cover on the unwritten bypass, and also check the hauler for any clue about this “name owed” business.*

### Turn 65 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You hold your stare on the fog-smile long enough to catch its “hooks”—not nails or branches, but *listening points*: tiny eddies where the mist catches on the edges of carved cartouches that don’t exist on the bark anymore. When you whisper your question, the smile doesn’t answer with words. It answers by **rearranging its hooks** into three little notches in the air—like a clerk sorting papers—then it *tilts* toward the chime-ring below, as if to say: *I’m what happens when a path gets edited and the margins remember.*

The lamplighter makes himself smaller on the handholds. “Not Court,” he murmurs. “Court’s ink is on bark. That… is what’s left when ink gets scraped off and the tree keeps the shape of the lie.”

At your question about Hush Brine, his eyes flick down toward your inner pocket as if he can hear the “INTEREST” vial through cloth. “Brine keeps ledgers in the **Wickward counting-niche**—a lockbox room behind the listening lamps at the Lantern-maker’s Quarter. Not public. You’ll smell clove oil and hot metal. He trades for laughs the way a butcher trades for cuts: **small mercies**. Safe routes. A blind eye. A lamp turned away at the right moment.” He swallows. “And sometimes… he trades *someone else’s* laugh. If he can tag it to your initials, the lamp doesn’t care whose throat it came from.”

The hauler freezes when you address them. Then—slowly—they nod once. Their hands move in a practiced, ashamed little language: two fingers to their mouth (laugh), then pinched shut (taken), then they tap the side of their head and drag the gesture outward like pulling thread from a spool.

The lamplighter watches, translating in a whisper. “He took their **directions**. The way their mind finds a place. That’s why they move careful—like every turn costs.”

As the hauler finishes, the fog-smile above the bypass twitches, pleased, and one of its hooks briefly aligns with your shadow—testing the outline of *Eldrin Vale* the way a scribe tests a seal.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** Midway up the right-trunk bypass; below and west, the searching hush has moved on, but the air still feels bruised where it listened.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Fog-smile: “edited margin” confirmed

### Turn 66 [PLAYER]

I keep my eyes on the fog-smile and trace those three notches in the air with one gloved fingertip. “If you’re the margin that remembers—what got scraped off? Brine’s name, mine, or this path’s?”

Then I turn my head slightly to the hauler. “If I draw you a map, can you still follow it—or did he take the part of you that recognizes your own marks?” I glance back to the lamplighter. “Counting-niche behind listening lamps… can we reach it without walking through a lamp’s ear, or do we need a bribe ready?”

*Agent reasoning: The fog-smile seems like a leftover witness; I want to learn what it “remembers.” Brine feels like the real thread, and the hauler’s stolen directions might be traced or restored if I’m careful.*

### Turn 67 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Your gloved fingertip passes through the three notches like through cool smoke—then the fog tightens *around* your finger, briefly taking its measure. The smile’s hooks shuffle, and for the first time it gives you something like an answer: the mist sketches a thin “scrape-line” across the air, then *writes without ink* three ghost-letters that won’t hold still. You catch only the first before they slough away: **“M—”**. Not Brine. Not E.V. Something older that starts the same way your nickname does, but isn’t it.

The lamplighter’s throat clicks. “That’s not a person’s name,” he murmurs. “That’s a **path-title**. Court scrapes titles off when they want a route to stop being repeatable.”

The hauler watches you ask about maps, then reaches into their bundle and pulls out a shard of cullet glass—flat, greenish, edge-smoothed by handling. They press it to their forehead, then to your map-knife handle, then to the bark: a little ritual of *transfer*. They can follow marks—so long as the mark is anchored to something that can be *touched*. Paper routes drift from them; carved or scored routes still “bite.”

As you mention the counting-niche, the lamplighter’s lantern shutter trembles. “Behind the listening lamps, yes—but there’s a service run the Guild uses: **wickwalks**. Narrow maintenance alleys where the lamps are hooded for cleaning. The ears are muffled there.” He hesitates. “Still… Brine posts a toll in that corridor. Not coin. He likes **a clean laugh**—one that hasn’t been told yet. Or a rumor with teeth.”

Downslope, through the hinge-gap, the bruising hush returns for a second pass—fainter, but angrier—like it realized it missed something and is pretending it didn’t care. The fog-smile above you reacts, hooks bristling, and your shadow briefly looks like it has an extra pair of antennae.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re near the upper bend of the unwritten bypass; below, the chime-ring is a dark halo; westward, the fog carries a second sweep of listening hush.

**STATUS UPDATES**

### Turn 68 [PLAYER]

I nod to the lamplighter and whisper, “Wickwalks, then—no heroics,” and I urge the hauler up and over the upper bend. Before I go, I murmur to the fog-smile, “M— isn’t enough. Show me the shape of the full title—no letters, just the turns,” and I press my map-knife flat to the bark to catch any remembered groove.  

As we move, I quietly tell the lamplighter, “I won’t pay Brine with a laugh. I’ll pay him with a rumor—does he still fear the old lantern-maker superstitions, or does he only fear ink?”

*Agent reasoning: The hush is sweeping again, so I should move, but the scraped path-title “M—” feels like a crucial clue. Brine’s toll suggests I should prepare a “teeth-rumor” instead of sacrificing a clean laugh.*

### Turn 70 [PLAYER]

I whisper, “Wickwalks—no heroics,” and guide the hauler up over the upper bend, motioning the lamplighter tight behind. Before I climb after them, I murmur to the fog-smile, “M— isn’t enough; show me the title as turns, not letters,” and press my map-knife flat to the bark to feel for any remembered groove.

As we move, I ask the lamplighter under my breath, “I won’t pay Brine with a laugh—only a rumor. Does he still fear old lantern-maker superstitions, or does he only fear ink?”

*Agent reasoning: The “M—” path-title and the margin-thing’s hooks feel like a clue worth grabbing before we lose the bypass; I also want a low-risk route via wickwalks and leverage on Brine without paying in laughter.*

I keep the hauler moving up over the upper bend, then pause just long enough to murmur to the fog-smile, “M— isn’t enough. Show me the title as turns, not letters,” and press my map-knife flat to the bark to feel for any remembered groove.  

As we slip onward toward the wickwalks, I lean close to the lamplighter. “I won’t pay Brine with a laugh—only a rumor. Does he still fear the lantern-maker superstitions, or does he only fear ink? What kind of story makes him blink first?”

*Agent reasoning: There’s no new scene text, so I’ll proceed with my intended cautious move: take the wickwalk route, try to capture the margin-thing’s “turn-shape” with my map-knife, and probe the lamplighter for what kind of rumor would actually buy passage with Brine.*

Then I lean close to the lamplighter as we slip toward the wickwalks. “No laughs for Brine—only a rumor. What superstition or story makes him blink first, and can we reach the counting-niche without stepping into a lamp’s ear?”

*Agent reasoning: There’s no scene text—so I’ll try to re-establish where we are and prompt the GM with a clear, in-character action toward the wickwalks while still probing the fog-smile and the lamplighter’s knowledge.*

### Turn 76 [PLAYER]

I press my map-knife flat to the bark and whisper to the fog-smile, “No more letters—just turns. Show me the route’s shape,” watching for any drift of mist that traces a path I can copy.  

Then I motion the hauler onward into the wickwalks and lean in to the lamplighter. “Brine won’t get a laugh from me—only a rumor. What story makes him blink first, and which stretch of wickwalk keeps us out of a lamp’s ear?”

*Agent reasoning: The “---” suggests I got no visible update; I’ll act as Eldrin by probing the fog-smile for a nonverbal route-shape, then keep the group moving into the wickwalks while pressing the lamplighter for the most effective rumor-toll and how to avoid the lamps’ hearing.*

### Turn 77 [GAME]

Your map-knife goes flat to the bark with a soft, wet *click*—like metal finding an old seam. The cartouches on the trunk don’t give you letters. They give you *pressure*: three shallow grooves that your blade keeps wanting to fall into, as if the tree remembers being cut that way.

The fog-smile reacts to your whisper like it’s amused you asked politely. Mist gathers at the trunk’s base and drifts—not forward like a road, but in a *sequence of bends*: a hard right that feels like stepping around a listening post, a long shallow left that hugs something warm, then a sudden back-step kink that doubles you behind your own footsteps. You can copy it as a shape: **right—long left—back-kink—straight through**. As you trace it in your head, the chimes in the distance ring one syllable late, as if confirming you didn’t say it aloud.

You keep the hauler moving. The wickwalks begin where the stones are stitched with old wick-cord, tar-dark lines laid into the path like veins. To the west, a pair of Guild lanterns hang low, their amber hush thickening the air; you feel them “turn” their attention when anyone speaks too clearly. Behind you, the glass-reed brook giggles uphill, faint but persistent—wrong-direction water always means the Hollow is close.

The lamplighter leans in, voice kept inside his teeth. “Brine? He blinks at *names* more than threats. He came up tallying laughs off rumor-cards—still thinks superstition is just ink with better posture.” He nods at your knife. “Tell him a story where a lantern-maker marked a lamp with a moth and it listened too well. Tell him the moth-marked lamps started bruising the air and learning *who* was lying. He’ll look away first—he hates anything that suggests the lamps have opinions.”

He angles his chin toward the wickwalk seam you just learned to see. “Keep to the wick-cord that’s *frayed*—the lamps don’t like to listen to what’s already unraveling. Don’t step on the neat, freshly tarred stitches. Those are Brine’s ears.”

As you pass, one nearby lantern gives a tiny, hungry *inhale*—and the clove-wrapped unmarked laugh-bottle in your pocket warms, as if it’s being noticed.

**Status updates:**

### Turn 78 [PLAYER]

I tug the clove-wrapped laugh-bottle deeper into my coat and wind my scarf over it, then steer the hauler onto the most frayed wick-cord I can find, walking the route-shape in my feet: hard right, long shallow left, then that back-step kink like I’m undoing my own trail.  

Without using Brine’s name, I murmur to the lamplighter, “This counting-niche—what does it look like, and what does it smell like when we’re close? Does he keep ledgers, cards, or teeth?”  

As the nearest lantern “inhales,” I stop breathing for a beat and slide my map-knife along the tar seam, listening for any change in pitch—like a gate-chime deciding whether it knows me.

*Agent reasoning: The lamps are listening and the laugh-bottle is drawing attention; I want to follow the route-shape and use the frayed stitches, but also probe the lamplighter about the “counting-niche” and Brine’s habits without saying names aloud.*

### Turn 79 [GAME]

You bury the clove-wrapped bottle deeper and bind it with scarf and cloth. The warmth in your coat dulls to a grudging ember—noticed, but no longer *advertised*.

On the frayed wick-cord, your feet follow the shape: hard right, long shallow left, then that back-step kink. The world answers in a practical way: the nearest lantern’s “attention” slides past you like a hand groping in the dark and finding only loose threads. Its amber hush still thickens the air to the west, but it doesn’t *catch*.

You stop breathing for a beat. The lamplighter mirrors you without being told—cheeks hollowed, eyes wide—and the hauler, bless their bundled silence, keeps trudging as if breath is a luxury.

Your map-knife rides the tar seam. At first it’s just drag and grit. Then—halfway through the back-kink—there’s a change: a thin, high *keening* through the metal, like glass about to sing. Not a chime that recognizes you; a chime that’s deciding whether you’re worth remembering. The pitch rises when your blade crosses a neat, freshly tarred stitch; it drops when you return to fray. That tells you where the “ears” are embedded: the clean seams.

Ahead and slightly downhill, the wickwalk dips into a recess between two soot-wet retaining walls. The air there smells different: lamp-oil gone sour, paper that’s been breathed on too many times, and a faint metallic sweetness—coin-sweat, or old blood, or both.

The lamplighter answers your murmured question without using the tallyman’s name. “Counting-niche is a bite taken out of the wall. One lantern bolted above it, hooded like it’s ashamed. Smells like hot tar, damp ledger, and clove when he’s been paid.” His gaze flicks to your coat, then away. “He keeps cards—rumor-cards, stamped. Ledgers too, but the cards are what he *touches*. Teeth?” A humorless exhale. “Only when he smiles. Don’t make him smile.”

As you near the recess, you catch another thread: a soft, rhythmic scratch-scratch from inside the niche, like a quill tallying without ink—someone is already counting, or pretending to.

**Status updates:**  
- Laugh-bottle: heat muffled  
- Listening seams identified: neat tar stitches  
- Counting-niche: close; occupied (scratching)

### Turn 80 [PLAYER]

I halt the hauler just short of the recess and gesture everyone to freeze, then crouch low and angle my map-knife to “read” the scratch-scratch—trying to tell if it’s quill, nail, or something else. In a breath-thin whisper to the lamplighter: “Stay off the neat tar; if the hooded lamp twitches, tug my sleeve.”

Keeping my voice aimed at the frayed wick-cord, not the niche, I call softly, “Counting’s private work—are you the keeper of cards in there, or just a borrower with a sharp habit?” Then I thumb my moth charm once and quietly rehearse the rumor under my breath: “A moth-marked lamp that learned lies by listening to names.”

*Agent reasoning: The niche is occupied and the lamps listen; I want to learn who’s inside without triggering the lantern, and prepare a rumor-payment that hits the tallyman’s fear of moth-marked lamps.*

### Turn 81 [GAME]

The hauler freezes mid-step, bundle swaying once before settling. The lamplighter goes still too, boots planted on fray, eyes locked on the hooded lantern above the recess.

You crouch and cant your map-knife like an ear-trumpet. The scratch-scratch resolves into three distinct textures: **a dry rasp**, then **a wet, papery drag**, then a **tiny click**—like a card corner being squared. Not a quill. Not a nail. Something hard and curved is doing the counting, and something *fibrous* is being tallied against.

To the west, the hooded lamp doesn’t brighten—it *tenses*. Its amber hush tightens the air, and the lamplighter’s hand hovers near your sleeve like he’s ready to yank you backward without warning.

Your soft call, aimed at the frayed cord, lands anyway. From inside the niche comes a pause, then a voice that doesn’t quite match the body it’s in—too calm, too close to laughter without actually laughing.

“Private work,” it agrees. “But not secret. Secrets sweat. Tallies stay dry.”

A shape shifts in the recess: you don’t get a full silhouette, just a glimpse of **pale card-edges** fanned like teeth, and behind them a hand—or something hand-shaped—pinching a stack with the careful intimacy of a clerk. The smell of damp ledger strengthens, and underneath it: **cold clove** that isn’t yours.

“I’m a borrower,” the voice continues, “with a habit that keeps the lamps fed and the Court polite. Keeper comes when called.”

You thumb the moth charm once. The brass warms—just a pulse—enough to raise the hair on your knuckles. The hooded lantern above the niche gives a minute twitch, as if it felt the charm’s heat through the air.

When you rehearse the rumor under your breath—moth-marked lamp learning lies by listening to names—the niche goes very still. Then the voice says, softly pleased, “Careful. That story makes counters blink.”

Behind you, the uphill brook’s giggle skips a beat, like someone missed a step on purpose. The lamplighter finally touches your sleeve—two fingers, a warning: the hooded lamp is listening *harder* now, even without light changing.

**Status updates:**  
- Scratch-source: card-edges + curved rasp  
- Hooded lamp: attention tightening  
- Niche voice: “borrower,” clove-cold scent

### Turn 82 [PLAYER]

I stay crouched on the frayed wick-cord and slide my map-knife back off any neat tar, keeping my breath shallow. “Borrower, then—what are you borrowing tonight: laughs, names, or the little turns people take when they think no one’s watching?”  

I tilt my head toward the hooded lantern without looking straight at it and murmur, “If the keeper comes when called, tell me what to call—title, not name. I trade in routes and rumors, not debts.”

*Agent reasoning: The “borrower” and the cold clove scent feel like a trap, but the card-edges and lamp attention are clues I can’t ignore; I’ll keep to frayed seams, probe for what it’s borrowing, and try to summon the actual keeper without giving away names.*

### Turn 83 [GAME]

Your knife slips cleanly back onto the frayed cord. The keening in the metal fades at once—proof you’re off the “neat” seams. The hooded lantern still feels like a held breath above the recess, but it stops tightening further, as if it lost the exact thread it was about to pull.

In the recess, the card-edges shift—*shhk, shhk*—and that curved rasp resumes, slower now, like the borrower is choosing which truth to spend.

“Tonight?” the voice says. “Not laughs. Laughs spoil in warm pockets.” A faint, deliberate inhale. “Not names either. Names are heavy. They make lamps hungry.”

Another tiny click: a card squared, then slid. The wet papery drag you heard earlier repeats, and you realize it’s bark-paper—Court stock, damp with wall-sweat.

“I’m borrowing the little turns,” it admits. “The back-steps. The hesitations. The places your feet lie even when your mouth doesn’t. Those tally well. Those keep.”

You tilt toward the hooded lantern without looking at it. Its flame doesn’t flare, but the air bruises slightly—like someone pressed a thumb into fog. Behind the lantern’s backplate, you catch the smallest misfit shadow-line: a seam that doesn’t belong to cast iron.

“If the keeper comes when called,” you murmur, “tell me what to call—title, not name.”

The borrower gives a soft sound that isn’t laughter but *almost*—like a smile filed down. “Title will do. Say: **Tallyman of Interest**. Say it like you’re paying in advance.”

The lamplighter’s fingers tighten on your sleeve once—warning and agreement both. “That title’ll wake the wrong ledgers,” he breathes, nearly voiceless. “But it’s true.”

Inside the niche, the pale fan of card-edges leans closer to the threshold, as if sniffing your restraint. “Routes and rumors,” it repeats. “Then trade clean. No debts.” A beat. “Show your hands empty of neat tar, and the lamp won’t claim you as a stitch.”

To the west, the Guild lanterns remain, listening; behind you, the uphill brook’s giggle returns, a little sharper—like it heard “Interest” and approved.

**Status updates:**  
- Knife off neat tar: keening stopped  
- Title learned: “Tallyman of Interest”

### Turn 84 [PLAYER]

I slowly lift both hands, palms out, keeping my map-knife visible and well away from any neat tar. “Empty of stitches,” I murmur, then angle my chin toward the hooded lamp’s backplate seam. “That lantern’s wearing a false skin—whose seam is that, and what’s it hiding?”

Still crouched, I add softly toward the niche, “I’ll trade clean: one route-shape—right, long left, back-kink, straight through—for one truth. Where does the Tallyman of Interest keep the rumor-cards when he sleeps, and what does he fear more than names?”

*Agent reasoning: I’m curious about the misfit seam on the lantern and the borrower’s card-teeth; I’ll cautiously probe for more info and try a small, clean trade without incurring “debt.”*

### Turn 85 [GAME]

Your hands rise, palms out. The hooded lantern’s listening pressure eases a fraction—enough that the fog stops feeling thumb-bruised. The borrower in the recess answers by *not* moving for a full breath, as if it’s checking whether you’ve truly kept off the neat tar.

Then the card-edges whisper again. “Empty of stitches,” it echoes, and the wet drag of bark-paper resumes—tallying your posture like it’s a commodity.

You angle your chin toward the backplate seam. Without looking directly, you still catch it: the seam isn’t ironwork at all. It’s **bark-paper lacquered black**, fitted over the lantern’s spine like a legal mask.

“Whose seam?” the borrower says. “Court seam. Vellum over bone.” A pause, and the voice grows careful. “It hides the lantern’s *mouth*. Some lamps don’t just listen. Some… repeat. And repeating makes routes become law.”

To the west, Guild light hushes in the alley-mouth like a patient creditor. Behind you, the hauler’s bundle creaks—one strap slowly giving way—then goes still again when the hauler clamps it with both arms, eyes down.

Your offer—right, long left, back-kink, straight through—lands like coin on a counter. The borrower makes that tiny click, squaring something. “That route-shape is already in circulation,” it says mildly. “But you’re offering it *clean*—unspoken on neat tar. That matters.”

The voice leans closer; you smell cold clove more strongly, as if someone else has been paying in your scent.

“Where does the Tallyman keep the rumor-cards when he sleeps?” it repeats, savoring the question. “In the **listening lamp that bruises air**—the one you don’t look at because it looks back. There’s a drawer behind the hood. Not wood. **Tongue-leather**. He sleeps with the key under his molar.”

“And what does he fear more than names?” The borrower’s tone flattens, suddenly unamused. “**Dates.** A date written in your own hand—dated next week. Because dates don’t argue. They arrive.”

As it says that, the hooded lantern gives a small, involuntary twitch—like it heard “next week” and tasted metal.

Somewhere up in the leaning trees, a puddle ripples without wind, and a pale cartouche on bark re-inks itself around a shadow that isn’t quite anyone’s.

**Status updates:**
- Hooded lamp: Court-mask confirmed  
- Rumor-cards stash: hood-drawer (tongue-leather)

### Turn 86 [PLAYER]

I ease back to the hauler and silently cinch the slipping strap with a quick knot, then return to the frayed wick-cord, eyes low. In a hush to the borrower: “If the lamp repeats and makes routes law—what’s the price to make it repeat a *false* route instead, just once?”

Still not looking straight at the hood, I murmur toward the niche, “And if I wanted to wake the Tallyman without names: would ‘next week’ written in my own hand draw him out, or draw the Court?”

*Agent reasoning: Dates scare him—so I can bait him without using names. The hooded lamp has a mouth and a drawer; I want to inspect that seam and maybe learn how it “repeats,” but I shouldn’t touch neat tar. Also the hauler’s strap is failing; I should quietly fix it before it betrays us with noise.*

### Turn 87 [GAME]

You ease off the frayed wick-cord and slide to the hauler’s side. The bundled cullet-hauler flinches, then realizes what you’re doing; their shoulders drop a hair. Your fingers find the slipping strap and cinch a quick, ugly knot—workmanlike, lantern-quarter style. The bundle stops creaking. The hauler gives you a single, grateful nod without meeting your eyes.

Back on the wick-cord, eyes low, you keep your breath shallow. To the west, Guild glow still pools at the alley-mouth, listening. Above, the hooded lantern’s masked backplate seam sits like a closed eyelid.

Your hush to the recess lands: the price to make a repeating lamp repeat a false route, once.

The borrower’s card-edges whisper—*shhk… shhk*—then the curved rasp slows, as if it’s counting the cost out loud but in a language made of friction.

“A repeating lamp doesn’t take coin,” it says. “It takes *witness*.” A pause. “To make it speak a false route, you must feed it a true fear—fresh—so it confuses the taste. One swallow of fear, one lie of direction.”

The lamplighter’s hand tightens on his own hook-lantern strap, knuckles whitening. “Don’t,” he breathes. “Feeding lamps is how the Guild makes them hungry.”

When you ask about waking the Tallyman without names—“next week” in your own hand—the recess goes quiet enough you can hear the uphill brook chuckle against glass reeds somewhere deeper in the Hollow.

“‘Next week’ in your hand draws **Interest** first,” the borrower says at last, careful. “He fears dates because they arrive to collect. He will come to correct the ledger before it becomes true.”

Another beat, and the voice adds, almost kindly: “But the Court hears dates like a bell. If you write it on bark-paper, or speak it where cartouches can drink it, the Court will come too—quiet as sap. Interest is fast. The Court is patient. Sometimes they arrive together and pretend they don’t know each other.”

Above the recess, the hooded lantern gives a minute twitch at the word *witness*, as if it recognized the meal being discussed.

**Status updates:**  
- Hauler’s bundle: strap secured  
- Lamp-price learned: fear as witness  
- “Next week” bait: Interest first, Court follows

### Turn 88 [PLAYER]

I keep low on the frayed wick-cord and whisper to the borrower, “What kind of fear counts as *fresh* without being… catastrophic—memory-fear, borrowed fear, staged fear?”  

Then I inch a half-step sideways (still on fray) to get a better angle on the hooded lantern’s seam and hood—no touching, just looking for a latch or tongue-leather edge—while murmuring to the lamplighter, “If the Guild light shifts, we peel back—same route-shape, no heroics.”

*Agent reasoning: The borrower’s hints about witness-fear and the tongue-leather drawer are too useful to ignore, but feeding lamps sounds dangerous; I’ll probe for safer “fear” options and quietly inspect the hooded lantern’s seam without touching neat tar, while also getting the hauler and lamplighter ready to move if the Guild glow advances.*

### Turn 89 [GAME]

The borrower answers your whisper immediately—too quickly for comfort, like it’s been hoping you’d ask.

“Fresh is *first-hand*,” it says from the recess, card-edges rasping. “Not staged. Not borrowed. Not a story you tell yourself to be brave. A lamp can taste the difference.”

You feel the definition land in your ribs: fresh fear is the kind that changes your breathing without permission.

“Memory-fear?” it continues. “Only if it’s still *alive* in you—if the remembering makes your hands sweat now. Borrowed fear is thin. Staged fear is sugar; the lamp gets hungrier after.”

As you inch a half-step sideways along the frayed cord, staying off the neat tar, your angle on the hooded lantern improves. The seam is clearer: black-lacquered bark-paper fitted under the hood’s rim. And there—just where iron should be riveted—there’s a **tongue-leather lip** peeking out, like a drawer-edge tucked too far in. No obvious latch, but the leather has a **bite-mark notch**, as if someone opens it with a tooth or a hooked nail rather than a key.

The lamplighter hears your murmur and gives a tight nod without looking up. “Same shape,” he agrees. “Right, long left, back-kink—then we’re gone.” He shifts his weight so his body blocks you from the west a little more.

Because the Guild light *does* shift: not closer, but *taller*, as if someone lifted a lantern higher to see over a shoulder. The listening glow thins into a beam that probes the alley-mouth.

The hauler, newly strapped, freezes hard—bundle hugged like a shield. From the trees above, a pale cartouche re-inks around that not-quite-anyone shadow again, and the hooded lantern gives a tiny, involuntary tremor, as if it’s trying not to repeat something it just heard.

The borrower lowers its voice. “If you feed it fear, choose a fear that ends. A fear with a door. Otherwise the lamp keeps the taste and follows you.”

**Status updates:**  
- Hood seam detail: tongue-leather lip  
- Guild lantern-beam: probing west mouth

### Turn 90 [PLAYER]

I whisper to the borrower, “A fear with a door—give me an example that won’t ruin me afterward. Something a cartographer can carry and set down.”  

Then, without touching the hood, I angle my map-knife to point—just barely—at the bite-mark notch and murmur to the lamplighter, “That drawer opens like a mouth. If the beam sweeps closer, we go—right, long left, back-kink—no bargaining.”

*Agent reasoning: The Guild beam is probing and the lamp-drawer looks accessible; I want one more clue from the borrower without escalating, then retreat along the planned route-shape before we’re spotted.*

### Turn 91 [GAME]

The borrower takes your question like a measurement—then answers with something small enough to carry.

“A fear with a door,” it whispers, “is a fear you can *close* again. For a cartographer: the fear of **misplacing the true mark**. You draw a line, and for one breath you’re certain you’ve just condemned someone to the wrong turn. Your stomach drops, your fingers go cold—then you check your own work and the fear has somewhere to go. That’s a door.”

Its card-edges rasp once, approving. “Make it fresh: don’t invent it. Put your blade-tip on a blank spot of your own map and *almost* ink the wrong landmark. Stop yourself at the last possible moment. Let your body believe it.”

You angle your map-knife—no touch—just a precise pointer at the bite-mark notch. The lamplighter follows the line of your blade with his eyes, and you see recognition hit: not surprise, but disgust. “Tongue-leather,” he mutters. “Court drawer. If it opens, it listens *back*.”

To the west, the Guild beam lifts higher again, searching over the lamplighter’s shoulder. The listening glow tightens the air; your skin prickles as if the light has fingers. The cullet-hauler’s bundle shifts with a glassy clink despite their grip—one betraying sound.

A soft, polite call rides the beam, not shouted—*placed*. “Lamplighter? You’re standing in a thin place.”

The lamplighter’s jaw sets. He keeps his lantern low, shielding the frayed wick-cord in shadow. “If it sweeps closer, we peel,” he breathes back to you, echoing your route-shape like a vow.

Above the hood, the bark-paper seam gives the faintest flex—like a mouth suppressing a word. The borrower’s voice drops further. “Be careful with ‘next week,’ Moth. Dates make mouths move.”

**Status updates:**  
- “Door-fear” example: mis-marking a route

### Turn 92 [PLAYER]

I keep crouched and whisper to the borrower, “One quick truth, then we’re gone—what *sound* opens that tongue-leather drawer: a title, a date, or teeth?”  

Without lifting my head, I call softly toward the beam, “Just a lamplighter and a hauler minding our own wick—who’s asking?”  

My fingers slide to my map’s edge, ready to peel right the moment the light touches the fray.

*Agent reasoning: The Guild beam is closing in, but I’m too curious to leave without at least identifying who’s calling and learning one more concrete detail about the drawer/Interest; I’ll also prepare to flee on the agreed route-shape.*

### Turn 93 [GAME]

The borrower answers your whisper with a sound you almost feel in your molars.

“**Teeth,**” it says. “Not biting—*clicking*. Two small clicks like a nervous jaw. Titles grease it. Dates wake what’s behind it. But the drawer is trained to **teeth-sound**. That’s why it has a bite-mark: it remembers the first mouth that opened it.”

As if to prove the point, the hooded lantern’s seam gives a tiny eager twitch—then stills, as though embarrassed to have reacted.

You keep your head down and call toward the probing beam. Your voice travels oddly in the listening light—cleaner than it should, like the glow is carrying it by the scruff.

A figure answers from the west, polite and close enough now that you can smell hot oil under their lantern-glass.

“Trail-right inquiry,” the voice says. “Cartouche Court. I’m **Clerk Alder-in-Ash**. I’m asking because your lamplight is standing where a path has been… contested.”

The lamplighter beside you goes rigid. He doesn’t raise his lantern—keeps it low and shielded. Under his breath to you: “Court. Not Guild.”

The cullet-hauler makes a small, involuntary sound—glass kissing glass—then clamps both arms tighter around the bundle.

The Court lantern-beam narrows, slides, and starts to descend toward the frayed wick-cord. Not touching yet, but hunting the edge where tar ends and the Hollow begins. The air bruises amber as it nears.

From the recess, the borrower hisses one last warning, quick as a shuffled card: “If anyone **clicks** at that notch, it opens and repeats what it hears—one syllable late.”

Your fingers are on your map’s edge; the fray is a hair’s breadth from being lit by that beam.

**Status updates**

### Turn 94 [PLAYER]

I keep my jaw slack—no clicks—and lift my empty left hand slightly toward the beam without rising. “Clerk Alder-in-Ash, I hear you. Contested by whom—Interest, Guild, or Court? I’m only here keeping a hauler’s glass from spilling into your ledger.”

Without looking up, I tug the lamplighter’s sleeve once and murmur, “Now—right.” Then I start to peel us along the fray: right, long left, back-kink, keeping my map tight to my chest and my steps soft off the neat tar.

*Agent reasoning: The Court beam is about to touch the fray; my best move is to keep them talking while we slip away via the agreed route-shape, and avoid any teeth-clicking that could open the drawer.*

### Turn 95 [GAME]

Your slack jaw and raised empty hand buy you a heartbeat: the beam hesitates, as if etiquette itself has weight. Clerk Alder-in-Ash’s voice stays calm, but it sharpens on your words.

“‘Interest’ is not a party to trail-right,” the clerk replies, too quickly—like a rehearsed correction. “Contested by **the Court**, on behalf of public continuity. A lamplighter standing in a thin place is… irregular.”

That’s all you need. You tug the lamplighter’s sleeve—**now**—and peel right.

The immediate outcome: you and the lamplighter slip along the frayed wick-cord *without* stepping on the neat tar. Your steps land on the wrong beats—soft, off-rhythm—so the listening air doesn’t “catch” your cadence. The cullet-hauler stumbles to follow, glass clinking once despite their effort.

Behind you, the Court beam drops to the fray and skims it like a finger reading raised ink. The hooded lantern’s tongue-leather seam flexes, hungry to repeat, but no one clicks teeth—so it stays shut.

Then the gutter-water uphill to your left chuckles louder, and the bundle of cracked chimes and dog-bones beneath it—what you took for trash—uncurls.

A **Hush-Hound** shakes itself into a shape: ribs like chime-struts, jaw hinged with iron, ribbons dragging wet. It doesn’t bark. It *listens*—head cocked toward the hauler’s clink, then toward the Court clerk’s measured syllables.

Clerk Alder-in-Ash steps closer into view at the west mouth: a slim figure with bark-paper tabs on their coat and a lantern whose glass is etched with tiny legal glyphs. “Stop,” they call, still polite. “State your names for the cartouche.”

The lamplighter hisses to you, barely audible: “Don’t. Names stick.”

The Hush-Hound starts forward on sound alone—one careful, off-beat step, then another—testing for a rhythm to bite.

### Turn 96 [PLAYER]

I keep moving—soft, off-rhythm—one hand hovering near the hauler’s bundle, signaling them to pad the glass with cloth and swallow any clinks. Without stopping, I call back toward Clerk Alder-in-Ash, “No names—only occupations: lamplighter, hauler, and a map-maker. We’re exiting the thin place to preserve your ‘public continuity.’”

As the Hush-Hound tests for a beat, I flick a single pebble into the gutter-water uphill to my left, trying to give it a false rhythm to follow while we commit to the long left.

*Agent reasoning: The Hush-Hound tracks rhythm and the Court wants names; I should keep off-beat, avoid giving names, and distract with controlled sound while continuing the route. Curiosity also wants a closer look at the hound’s “listening” behavior without getting caught.*

### Turn 97 [GAME]

Your pebble kisses the uphill gutter-water with a crisp *tick—tock* as it skips twice. The water answers with a giggle that’s a half-beat too steady.

**Immediate outcome:** the Hush-Hound commits to the false rhythm—head snapping left, ribs chiming as it pads toward the gutter’s cadence instead of your retreat. It buys you distance, but it doesn’t lose interest; it’s already learning that the Hollow can *lie in tempo*.

You keep your steps off-beat and signal the hauler. They finally understand: a shaking hand digs cloth—old sack-linen—between bottle-necks. The bundle’s clink dulls to a muffled, swallowed *thrum*.

Behind you to the west, Clerk Alder-in-Ash doesn’t chase. Their lantern stays aimed at the fray like a pen poised over a signature. “Occupations are still identifiers,” they call, voice mild as a verdict. “But… I accept the courtesy of exit. Be advised: a **map-maker** in a contested seam is presumed to be *publishing*.”

As you commit to the long left, the frayed wick-cord underfoot changes texture—tar gives way to something like braided hair stiff with soot. Your moth-charm warms against your chest in answer, as if pleased you’re obeying a line it remembers.

The lamplighter stays close, lantern low. He mutters, not to the clerk but to you: “Court’s writing you into a file with no name. Worse.”

The Hush-Hound reaches the gutter and snaps once at the water’s skipping-beat—jaws clacking iron on nothing. That *clack* echoes wrong: one syllable late, like a chime answering itself. The hooded lantern behind you twitches in sympathy, but still no one clicks at its notch.

Time pressure tightens: the Court beam begins to sweep in short arcs, searching for your **rhythm** now instead of your faces.

**Status updates**

### Turn 98 [PLAYER]

I whisper to the lamplighter and hauler, “No steady steps—swap lead every three breaths; breathe through cloth.”  

As we move, I drag the tip of my map-knife lightly along the hair-braid soot-tar for a few feet, then stop—making a thin, irregular scrape-track behind us like a false “footline.”  

Without turning back, I call to Alder-in-Ash, “If you think I’m *publishing*, tell me the statute—what counts as a map in your Court: ink, memory, or feet?”

*Agent reasoning: The Court is hunting our rhythm and the Hush-Hound is learning; I want to break pattern, keep the hauler quiet, and glean what “publishing” means without giving identifiers. The braid-hair footing and moth-charm warmth feel like a clue, so I’ll follow it while laying a decoy rhythm behind us.*

### Turn 99 [GAME]

Your whispered cadence-rule lands. The lamplighter nods once, tight-jawed, and starts counting breaths with his shoulders. The hauler presses cloth to their mouth and bundle both—breathing turns into a damp, muted pull that doesn’t ring the glass.

**Immediate outcome:** the scrape-track works—partly. Your map-knife draws a thin, irregular bright line in the soot-braid, and the Court’s lantern-beam snaps to it like an eye catching a fresh signature. For a few seconds, Alder-in-Ash follows the false “footline” instead of your shifting, swapped-lead footfalls.

But the hair-braid tar doesn’t just take a mark; it *remembers the hand*. A faint moth-dust shimmer lifts from the scrape and hangs in the air behind you—your own tell, delayed.

To the west, Alder-in-Ash answers your shouted question with the satisfaction of someone citing a favorite paragraph. “Statute of Living Cartouche, third leaf, recital nine: **a map is any repeatable instruction that survives the speaker**. Ink. Memory. Feet. Even a rumor-card warmed at a lamp.” A pause—then, softer. “And yes, Master Map-maker, *occupations* can be repeatable too.”

Their lantern tilts, and the legal glyphs on its glass crawl into alignment; the beam stops searching for faces and starts “reading” the ground: scrape, scuff, soot-press, breath-fog.

Up left, at the gutter, the Hush-Hound lifts its iron jaw from the water and turns its head toward the new sound you made: the knife’s whisper on braid-tar. It doesn’t sprint. It pads in listening-stops, learning your pattern by the absence of pattern.

Ahead on your long left, the seam narrows between two bent trunks whose bark-cartouches keep rewriting around your moving shadows—trying to pin you to a single “true” outline.

**Status updates**

### Turn 100 [PLAYER]

I hiss, “Cloaks over heads—break your shoulders,” and pull my own coat wide to drape it awkwardly so my shadow becomes a hunched, two-headed shape. As we pass between the bent trunks, I angle my lantern-low charm-hand to cast our shadows onto the *trunks* instead of the ground, then shove a loose strip of bark-cartouche down and step on it to smear its rewriting.

Without slowing, I call back to Alder-in-Ash, “Recital nine cuts both ways—if I speak no repeatable instruction, you’ve got no map; only a frightened man walking. Tell me this: does your Court punish *publishing*, or merely *being readable*?”

*Agent reasoning: The Court lantern is reading traces and the cartouches ahead are trying to “fix” our outlines; I want to confuse both by breaking our silhouettes and leaving misleading shadows, while keeping the hound off our rhythm. Also, I want more info from the clerk without giving names.*

### Turn 101 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** the shadow-trick works—messily, but enough. With cloaks hauled over heads and shoulders “broken,” your three shadows on the bent trunks become a lurching, two-headed huddle with mismatched limb-lengths. The bark-cartouches try to re-ink around that outline, can’t agree on what they’re pinning, and stutter.

When you wrench down the loose strip of cartouche-bark and step hard, sap bursts under your heel like warm glue. The rewriting smears into an illegible thumbprint—your boot sole stamped into the Court’s sentence. For a breath, the trunks stop “correcting” you.

The cost hits immediately: the sap’s sheen catches the Court’s lantern-beam from the west like fresh wax on a seal. Alder-in-Ash’s light finds your smear and *lingers*—not fooled, but interested.

You’re now through the narrowest part of the long-left pinch. Behind you, the hair-braid soot gives way to slick stone that sweats cold; ahead, the path kinks around a listening-lantern bolted to a root, its glass bruising the air with attention.

Alder-in-Ash answers your call without raising their voice. “We don’t punish publishing,” they say. “We punish **unlicensed persistence**. Being readable is not a crime—until it makes a route that outlives the Court’s edits.” Their tone stays polite, but the next words are a warning: “Stop smearing cartouches. That is destruction of public record.”

As they speak, the pale glyphs on the trunks—those you *didn’t* smear—begin to reorder themselves into neat lines. Your eyes catch them straight-through for half a second, and the script tries to finish a “ruling” inside your head: distances go syrupy; your sense of the long-left starts to tug toward a more “official” curve, as if your feet are being gently corrected.

At the same time, the Hush-Hound pads closer from uphill-left, drawn by the earlier scrape and now by the wet *schlip* of sap under your boot. It pauses, listening hard enough that the chimes in its ribs go still.

**Status updates**
- Bent-trunk pinch: crossed  
- Cartouche smear: successful, conspicuous

### Turn 102 [PLAYER]

I snap my gaze down and pull my sleeve over my eyes like a blindfold, hissing, “Don’t read the trunks—eyes down, hum through cloth.” Keeping the off-rhythm, I steer us wide around the listening-lantern bolted to the root, and with my free hand I smear a little of that shiny sap onto a pebble and roll it hard to the far side of the kink to “carry” our trace away.

Without turning back, I call to Alder-in-Ash, voice tight, “If your Court edits paths, then swear this: which way leads out without binding us to your record—north by stone-sweat, or past the root-lantern?”

*Agent reasoning: The glyphs are trying to rewrite my sense of distance—dangerous. I want to avoid reading anything and also get curious about that listening-lantern ahead, but we’re being hunted; I’ll shield eyes, keep moving off-pattern, and try a small misdirection for the Hush-Hound without making noise.*

### Turn 103 [GAME]

You sleeve-blind yourself in time. The half-formed “ruling” in your head loses its ink, sliding off into a dull pressure behind the eyes instead of a direction your feet must obey. Your hissed orders carry: the lamplighter drops his gaze; the hauler’s hum starts up, muffled through cloth like a saw behind a wall.

**Immediate outcome:** steering wide of the root-bolted listening-lantern helps. Its glass seems to *lean* toward your footfalls, trying to drink the shape of them, but you keep to the stone-sweat edge where the cold slickness smears prints into nothing. The sap-smeared pebble rolls hard around the kink and clacks twice—then skids—leaving a bright, readable smear-line that the Court’s lantern-beam immediately prefers. It’s a convincing decoy trace, because it carries the same glossy “seal” you stamped into the cartouche.

You’re now just past the kink: to your right, the root-lantern hangs like a patient ear; to your left, stone sweats in beads that smell faintly of burnt wick and pennies. Behind, the bent trunks’ cartouches continue rewriting, but your group’s shadows have already slipped beyond their easy pinning.

Alder-in-Ash doesn’t answer at once. You hear the small shift of their boots as they re-aim, and their voice comes measured—careful not to become “repeatable instruction.” “I will not swear a way out,” they call back. “Sworn directions become public record, and public record becomes binding.”

Then, a concession, almost kind: “Stone-sweat north is **less readable**. The root-lantern is **more merciful**—and more loyal. It reports.”

At the same moment, the Hush-Hound pauses at the kink. Its rib-chimes go still, listening for the “true” you among the false. It noses toward the sap-bright pebble trail, tempted.

The lamplighter leans close to you, whisper-hot: “He’s telling you the truth in Court-words. ‘Less readable’ is the closest you’ll get to safe.”

**Status updates**
- Cartouche “ruling”: disrupted by blindfold  
- Root listening-lantern: avoided, still attentive

### Turn 104 [PLAYER]

I nod once, still half-blind, and steer us north along the stone-sweat, keeping our steps sloppy and trading the lead on three breaths. I whisper to the lamplighter, “Douse your lantern to a coal—no glow to silhouette us—then listen for the hound’s ribs; tell me if it chooses the sap trail.”  

As we go, I pull a scrap of cloth free and wipe the sap off my boot in a quick, smeared pass on the wet stone, then flick the cloth back behind us into the kink like a discarded “signature.”

*Agent reasoning: “Less readable” sounds like our best chance to slip the Court and the root-lantern; I also want to exploit the Hush-Hound’s hesitation and keep everyone from leaving clean traces.*

### Turn 105 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the northward stone-sweat run buys you distance. The wet rock takes your smeared wipe like a confession and then *dilutes it*—sap thins, spreads, and loses the crisp “seal” quality the Court’s lantern likes to read. When you flick the cloth back into the kink, it lands with a soft slap where the pebble-trail begins, a bright little flag of “signature” for anyone hunting persistence.

The lamplighter obeys. His lantern drops to a coal-glow—still alive, but no longer painting you into silhouettes. In the sudden dim, your moth-charm feels warmer against your palm, like it’s pleased you stopped feeding other lights.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re on the stone-sweat edge now, north of the kink; behind you (south), the root-lantern’s “ear” is out of sight but not out of attention. The rock underfoot sweats cold beads that pop when stepped on, like tiny blisters.

Your three-breath lead-trade keeps your group from becoming a single readable gait. The hauler’s hum—through cloth—turns the air into a soft vibration that makes it harder to pick out individual footfalls.

Behind, the Hush-Hound makes its choice. The lamplighter tilts his head, listening hard enough his jaw clicks. “Ribs rang once,” he whispers. “Then… quiet. It took the sap. It’s following the bright lie.”

Not fully, though. A second sound threads underneath: a slow, deliberate *tap*—Alder-in-Ash’s staff or boot heel—testing the stone-sweat’s slickness from the west, not chasing at a run, but refusing to lose you. Their lantern-beam, faint at this distance, keeps drifting back to the kink where your cloth-flag sits like a legal exhibit.

Ahead, the stone-sweat bends around a low rise where the fog thickens into a seam of darker gray. Wind-chimes you can’t see start tuning themselves to your heartbeat again—then slipping a note off on purpose, as if someone is learning your rhythm and correcting it slightly wrong.

### Turn 106 [PLAYER]

I press two fingers to my moth-charm and deliberately change my breathing pattern—three short inhales, one long exhale—then whisper, “Don’t match the chimes; match me, and I’ll keep changing.”  

Crouching, I feel the stone-sweat with my fingertips and toss a couple pebbles ahead into the darker fog seam to listen for depth or hollow echoes. “Lamplighter—any sign Alder’s tapping is closing, or just pacing us?”

*Agent reasoning: The chimes are syncing to my heartbeat—dangerous if they learn my rhythm—so I’ll disrupt my own tempo and investigate the fog seam for an exit while keeping the group quiet and unreadable.*

### Turn 107 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** changing your breathing *works*—the unseen chimes ahead try to “take” your rhythm, catch the first pattern, then you shift it and they lag a half-beat behind. The air’s pressure eases, like something that had its teeth on your pulse just lost its grip.

As your fingers touch the stone-sweat, it feels slick as cold skin. Your fingertips come away shining with tiny beads that smell faintly metallic. You toss two pebbles into the darker fog seam.

The first pebble lands with an ordinary *tick… skitter…* and stops.

The second drops farther than it should. There’s a thin, delayed *tok*—then a soft, amused *clink-clink* as if it struck something hanging, not ground. The fog seam isn’t just thicker air; it’s a looped pocket where sound behaves wrong, like a throat clearing itself.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re crouched on the stone-sweat north edge, just before the darker fog seam where the path rises slightly; behind and west, Alder-in-Ash’s coal-lantern glows faintly through trees like an eye half-closed.

Above your head, a wind-chime that wasn’t there a moment ago resolves into view: bone and iron pieces suspended from *nothing*, swaying without wind. It only appears cleanly when your breath steadies—then blurs when you change it.

The lamplighter leans close, voice low enough to be more felt than heard. “Alder’s not closing,” he says. “He’s *measuring*. Same distance. Same patience. That’s Court work—keep you in range until you make a mistake they can notarize.”

As he speaks, the bone-and-iron chime-creature twitches—pieces clicking once, eager—trying to re-find the “true” tempo in your chest. Your shifting breath keeps it from locking on, but it’s here now, hanging just ahead of the fog seam like a trap that learned to listen.

Farther back, a single, brighter pulse of light flares at the kink—your discarded sap-cloth catching someone’s attention. Not the hound (too quiet), more like a lantern-beam pausing to “read” evidence.

### Turn 108 [PLAYER]

I keep my sleeve over my mouth and switch to an uneven count—two short, one long, then hold—whispering, “No one breathe the same twice.”  

Still crouched, I take out my map-knife and gently tap the stone near the seam in three different spots, listening for the “hollow” edge, then toss another pebble tied to a short thread of cloth (a quick knot) into the fog to see if it swings or catches on whatever clinked.  

Without looking up at it, I murmur toward the hanging chime-thing, “What are you called when you’re not pretending to be wind?” and signal the others to angle left, skirting the seam’s rim instead of walking straight into it.

*Agent reasoning: The fog seam is a weird loop-pocket and the chime-creature is trying to lock onto my rhythm; I want to learn what it is without letting it “read” me, and maybe use the loop-pocket to shake Alder’s measuring pace.*

### Turn 110 [PLAYER]

I keep my sleeve over my mouth and shift to an uneven count—two short breaths, one long, then a held pause—whispering, “No one breathe the same twice.”  

Still crouched, I draw my map-knife and tap the stone near the seam in three spots, listening for the hollow edge; then I knot a short strip of cloth to a pebble and toss it into the fog to see if it swings or catches on whatever made that clink.  

Without looking up, I murmur toward the hanging chime-thing, “What are you called when you’re not pretending to be wind?” and I gesture the others left to skirt the seam’s rim instead of walking straight into it.

*Agent reasoning: The fog seam feels like a sound-warping pocket and the hanging chime-thing is trying to lock onto our rhythm; I want to probe the edge safely, test what’s in the fog with a tethered pebble, and try talking to the chime without “reading” it directly while we skirt the rim.*

### Turn 112 [PLAYER]

I keep my sleeve over my mouth and switch to an uneven breath—two short, one long, then a hold—hissing, “No one breathe the same twice.”  

Crouched, I tap the stone with my map-knife in three spots to find the hollow edge; then I knot a strip of cloth to a pebble and toss it into the fog seam, watching the line for a snag or swing.  

Without looking up at it, I murmur to the hanging chime-thing, “What are you called when you’re not pretending to be wind?” and gesture everyone left to skirt the seam’s rim.

Still crouched, I tap the stone with my map-knife in three spots to find the hollow edge; then I knot a strip of cloth to a pebble and toss it into the fog seam, watching the line for a snag or swing.  

Without looking up, I murmur toward the hanging chime-thing, “What are you called when you’re not pretending to be wind?” and I gesture everyone left to skirt the seam’s rim.

*Agent reasoning: The fog seam is behaving like a hollow pocket with something hanging inside; I want to map its edge, test the snag point with the cloth-line, and see if the chime-thing can be engaged or named—while keeping us from walking into the trap and staying ahead of Alder’s pacing.*

### Turn 115 [GAME]

Your uneven breathing throws the seam off its rhythm. The fog’s “listening” pressure eases—just a notch—like a hand loosening on a throat. The off-key clink doesn’t repeat.

Still crouched at the darker fog seam’s rim, you tap three times with the map-knife. The first tap comes back dead and flat. The second returns a faint, wrong echo—too close, as if there’s a pocket under the stone. The third tap *rings* and the ring arrives a half-beat late: hollow edge, running diagonally away from you toward the seam’s thickest milk.

You knot cloth to a pebble and toss. The line slides into the fog… then stops as if hooked on a nail midair. The cloth doesn’t go taut like it’s caught on something solid; it *angles*, gently, as though the fog itself has a current. Then the pebble begins to swing in a slow arc you didn’t give it, tracing a pendulum that points—again and again—toward the left-hand skirt you’re signaling. Something in there wants bodies to step straight in, not around.

Above and slightly behind your right shoulder, the hanging chime-thing stirs without wind. Bone and cracked glass tick together, then speak your question back with one syllable missing, like it’s tasting it.

“I am called… **After**,” it answers, voice thin as wire. “When I’m not pretending.”

A second sound threads through the seam: a soft scrape of leather on stone from deeper left—someone else crouched there, trying very hard to be quiet. You catch a sliver of lantern-amber through the fog, shuttered and careful: a Wickward lamplighter’s hooded glow, held low to avoid “bruising” the air. Whoever it is pauses when the chime speaks, as if they’ve just heard a name they didn’t want to.

The fog thickens in the centerline where your pebble hangs, and the seam gives a tiny, hungry chuckle—more vibration than sound—testing whether anyone will forget and breathe the same way twice.

### Turn 116 [PLAYER]

I keep the uneven breath going and slowly reel the cloth-line back an inch at a time, watching for the snag-point, then pinch the line and mark that angle in my mind like a compass bearing. Without rising, I whisper to the others, “Left is right—single file, don’t step where the pebble wanted you.”

Then, still not looking up at the chime, I murmur, “After… after what?” and tilt my chin toward the shuttered amber glow. “Wickward—friend or filer? Say a name before the fog does.”

*Agent reasoning: There’s another lamplighter hiding left and the seam seems to “want” us straight in; I want to learn who that is and what “After” is, while keeping everyone moving safely around the rim.*

### Turn 117 [GAME]

You keep the uneven breath—two short, one long, hold—and reel the cloth-line back a finger’s width at a time. The snag-point doesn’t scrape like stone; it *releases in reluctance*, as if you’re pulling thread out of honeyed air. For three inches it comes easy… then the line tugs sideways again, insisting on that same leftward angle. When the pebble finally noses out of the fog, it’s cold-wet and dusted with fine moth-shimmer, but unscuffed—caught by current, not claw.

Pinching the line, you fix the bearing in your head: the seam “flows” left, and the hollow edge you found understone runs diagonal toward the seam’s fattest part. Your whisper carries low and clean. The fog doesn’t mimic it this time.

To your left, the rim stones sweat harder, beading with cold as if the seam resents being skirted. Behind your right shoulder, the chime-thing ticks once—bone to glass—like a tongue click.

“After… **the first laugh**,” it answers. “After the lamp learns hunger. After the name is filed. After you step where you were asked not to.”

The shuttered amber glow shifts; whoever holds it adjusts their grip, and the lantern’s listening bruises the air in a small oval. A figure resolves in the fog’s thin: hooded, crouched, one hand “mending” at nothing—fingers moving like they’re tightening an invisible wick. A nail-bright pin glints at their collar.

They speak without standing. “Nail Jun,” they say, too quick, like it’s a receipt they want on record. “Surveyor. Wickward Guild.” The lantern’s shutter opens a hair, then closes again, as if even its light is trying not to hear “After.”

Nail’s gaze flicks to your cloth-line, then to the seam, then away—back to their invisible work. “Friend if you’re lost. Filer if you’re profitable,” they add, voice mild. “And you—Moth—have been very… *loud* on paper lately. There’s a vial out with your name’s interest.”

As you start the leftward skirt, the seam gives a quiet chuckle that *doesn’t* come from the center anymore—it comes from just ahead on the rim, testing your single-file. The chime above you rings one syllable late, like it’s counting your breaths.

**Status updates:**

### Turn 118 [PLAYER]

I keep us moving left in tight single file, palm out to slow anyone drifting toward the rim-chuckle, and I tuck the moth-dusted pebble into my pocket. Without breaking the uneven breath, I whisper to Nail Jun, “A vial with my name’s interest—whose hand holds it, and what do they pay in: blood, breath, or maps?”  

Then, still refusing to look up at the chime, I murmur, “After the first laugh… whose laugh was it?” and I tap the stone ahead—once—testing for that diagonal hollow edge before I put my weight down.

*Agent reasoning: “After” and Nail Jun both imply names can be filed/collected; I want to learn what the vial is and what “first laugh” means, but we’re in immediate danger with the seam testing the rim—so I’ll keep the party moving left while I probe Nail for specifics and watch for the rim-chuckle trap.*

### Turn 119 [GAME]

You keep the line moving left, tight and deliberate, your palm hovering like a quiet gate. When the rim-chuckle tries to “pull” a boot toward it, your hand stops the drift—small correction, big difference. The seam’s laughter thins, annoyed, and relocates again a few paces ahead, trying to find a weaker marcher.

The moth-dusted pebble goes into your pocket; it leaves a faint cool smear against your thigh, like ash that remembers wings.

Ahead, you tap the next stone once with the map-knife before trusting it. The sound comes back *late* and a little too bright—hollow edge, diagonal, still tracking toward the seam’s thick center. You don’t step there. Your single tap keeps you from putting weight on a lip that would’ve “given” just enough to slide a foot into the fog’s current.

To your rear-left, Nail Jun keeps pace in a crouch, lantern shutter barely cracked. Their voice stays low, professional. “Hush Brine’s hand holds the interest,” they answer. “Tallyman. Keeps the books that keep the lamps fed.” A pause; you hear the faint click of a shutter being tightened. “They pay in routes. In names. In the kind of breath you can’t get back once it’s written down. Blood is messy—Guild prefers clean debts.”

Above and behind you, the chime called After does not ring—does not pretend to be wind—so much as *settle* into attention. When you ask whose laugh, its reply arrives one syllable late, like always.

“**Yours**,” After says softly. “Not the one you made. The first one they *took*.”

As it speaks, the fog seam pulses inward, as if pleased to hear ownership said aloud. Nail Jun’s lantern bruises the air for a heartbeat—an involuntary flare—then shutters hard, like they’re afraid the light itself will start listening too well.

You’re still on the seam’s rim, left-skirt holding, with the diagonal hollow edge now clearly something you can “read” by sound—so long as you keep testing before each step.

**Status updates**

### Turn 120 [PLAYER]

I swallow hard, keep the uneven breath, and whisper to Nail Jun, “Hush Brine—where do I find him when the lamps go dim, and what does he trade back for a debt he can’t cleanly collect?”

Still moving left, I tap the next two stones—one, then the next—marking the safe ones with a faint chalk nick from my knife-hand. Without looking up, I murmur to After, “If it was mine, tell me where you keep it—my first laugh—and what you want for its return.”

*Agent reasoning: The chime claiming my “first laugh” feels like a stolen memory—dangerous leverage. I want details from both After and Nail Jun, and I also need to keep the group safe by continuing the careful tap-and-skirt pattern.*

### Turn 121 [GAME]

Your swallow almost breaks the pattern—your throat wants to *even out*—but you force the uneven breath through it. The fog seam doesn’t get that satisfying “same-same” it’s been fishing for, and the rim-chuckle ahead stutters, as if it lost the thread of your heartbeat.

You tap the next stone: the note comes back solid, immediate. Safe. You nick it with a pale chalk-scratch from your knife-hand. The next stone answers a fraction late—hollowed diagonal—so you don’t mark it; you shift your weight to the first nicked one and keep the file tight. The seam’s center thickens and slides beside you like milk in a tilted bowl, but it doesn’t catch.

To your rear-left, Nail Jun’s shuttered amber glow bobs once, then steadies. They speak quietly, eyes on your nicks more than your face. “Hush Brine goes where lamps go dim on purpose,” they say. “Under the Lantern-maker’s Quarter—behind the listening lamp by the iron gate, where the wick-smoke clings to brick like a confession.” Jun’s fingers keep “mending” an invisible wick as they talk. “If a debt won’t collect clean, Brine trades it sideways. He’ll offer you a *different* name to carry. Or a route that makes someone else disappear instead of you. He calls it mercy because the books balance.”

Above and behind, After answers your murmur without you looking up. The chime doesn’t ring this time; it *clicks* like teeth meeting.

“I keep it where first-things are kept,” it says. “In a lantern that listens so hard it bruises the air. Not Guild. Not Court. A private light.” Your skin prickles—somewhere close, amber pressure swells and fades, like a lantern turning its ear toward you.

“What I want?” After continues, one syllable late. “A true direction spoken aloud. One you have not sold. Say it, and I’ll show you the bruise-lantern’s door. Refuse, and you’ll keep laughing around the missing piece forever.”

Nail Jun flinches at that—small, controlled. “Don’t bargain with stray chimes,” they mutter, but there’s uncertainty under the authority. Their lantern shutter tightens again, as if trying to keep the light from overhearing your answer.

The rim ahead sweats cold; your chalk nicks form a thin, readable spine along the leftward skirt. The seam’s chuckle has gone quiet—listening now, patient.

### Turn 122 [PLAYER]

I keep the uneven breath and keep us edging left, tapping each new stone before weight, adding a chalk nick only to the solid ones.  

Without looking up, I murmur to After, “A true direction, then—*toward the light that isn’t there.* That’s the only north I’ve never sold.”  

Then I whisper to Nail Jun, “You heard it too—‘a private light.’ Who keeps a bruise-lantern in this place, and what do you know about that iron gate listening lamp under the Quarter?”

*Agent reasoning: After is offering a lead on my stolen “first laugh,” but it wants something precious: an unsold true direction. I’m curious and tempted, yet I don’t want to hand it a clean handle on me; I’ll try to give a direction that’s true but phrased obliquely, and keep the group safe by continuing the chalk-marked path while pressing Nail Jun for what they know about the bruise-lantern.*

### Turn 123 [GAME]

Your uneven breath holds. Tap—solid. Chalk nick. Tap—late-bright. You don’t step. The seam tries to “help” by sliding its milky center under your boot, but your tested stones keep you on the left rim, and the rim-chuckle can’t quite get purchase on your line.

When you murmur, *toward the light that isn’t there*, After goes still—so still the air feels pinned.

Then the sound arrives one syllable late anyway: a soft, satisfied *ting*.

The fog in front of you parts—not like wind, like a curtain choosing to be drawn—revealing a narrow, moon-sour alley-mouth cut into nothing. No bricks, no boards, just an opening shaped like a throat clearing. Along its edge hangs a lantern that does not swing. Its glass is bruised amber, as if someone pressed a thumb into light and left a fingerprint. The air around it is tender and sore, listening so hard it makes your teeth ache.

You’re still on the seam’s left skirt; the alley-mouth is now a few paces ahead and slightly inward toward the seam’s thicker center. Your chalk nicks point to it like a stitched hemline.

Nail Jun’s crouch freezes. Their shuttered lantern tightens until it’s almost dark. “Don’t—” they start, then swallow the rest. “Private bruise-lanterns aren’t Guild issue. That’s… Choir work. Or Court contraband.” Their eyes flick to the bruised glass and away, like looking is a signed document.

At your whisper, Jun answers carefully. “Who keeps one? People who can’t file a route through the Court and can’t afford the Guild’s ‘safe.’ People who need a door that listens and doesn’t report.” A beat. “The iron gate listening lamp under the Quarter—Guild maintains it. Officially it ‘hears’ lost travelers and steadies them. Unofficially…” Jun’s mouth tightens. “It hears names. It hears bargains. Brine uses it like a ledger you can’t burn.”

Behind you, somewhere in the fog, the rim-chuckle returns—farther back now—like the seam has decided to let you go forward if it can herd someone else into panic later.

After clicks once, teeth-on-glass. “Door shown,” it says, one syllable late. “Now keep your north. Don’t look up.”

### Turn 124 [PLAYER]

I hold the file with a low palm-back signal to stop, then creep one careful step closer—only onto a chalk-nicked stone—and extend my map-knife toward the bruised lantern, not to touch, just to feel the air’s “pressure.” “When you listen,” I whisper, “do you take names… or directions?”

Without looking up, I murmur to After, “If this door reports to Choir or Court, I want to know before I cross—what did you just sell me into?”

Then I glance at Nail Jun’s hands and pin, keeping my voice thin. “Choir work, you said—tell me what you know. And if I step through, do you follow, file me, or cut the line?”

*Agent reasoning: A secret door that listens is irresistible, but it’s also a trap; I’ll probe it without committing, keep the group safe, and question Nail Jun about Choir/Court while testing how the lantern “hears.”*

### Turn 125 [GAME]

Your palm-back stops the file cleanly; even Nail Jun freezes mid-step, weight hovering. You creep one pace forward onto a chalk-nicked stone—solid underfoot—and extend the map-knife toward the bruised lantern without touching.

**Immediate outcome:** the air pushes back.

Not a wind—pressure with intent. The knife-tip trembles as if it’s being “read” along its edge. The bruised glass does not brighten, but the space around it tightens, listening so hard it makes your gums ache. A faint, wet-paper smell seeps out of the alley-mouth, like a ledger left in rain.

You whisper, “When you listen… do you take names… or directions?”

The lantern answers by *showing* you the difference: the pressure slides up your forearm toward your throat when you say “names,” then drops to your boots when you say “directions,” as if it prefers paths to people. The seam behind you gives a soft, jealous snicker—kept at bay by your chalk spine, but attentive.

Without looking up, you murmur to After. The chime’s reply arrives one syllable late, too pleased.

“I sold you into nothing,” After says. “I cannot sell. I only ring. This door reports to whoever speaks truest inside it. Court will try to make it a record. Guild will try to make it a meter. Choir will try to make it a throat.”

Nail Jun’s hands—wool gloves, a surveyor’s pin tucked near the cuff—tighten around their shuttered lantern. They swallow, then answer your thin-voiced question like it costs them.

“Choir doesn’t *make* bruise-lanterns,” Jun says. “They find listening lights and hurt them until they hear heartbeats. Court steals the hurt and calls it ‘authentication.’” Their gaze flicks to the bruised glass again, unwilling. “If you step through… I don’t file you. Not yet.”

Jun’s thumb touches the pin at their cuff—an unconscious tallyman’s habit. “I follow far enough to know whether you’re an asset, a liability, or a missing page. If the door starts taking *names* instead of directions, I cut the line. That’s not cruelty. That’s survival.”

The alley-mouth holds open, throat-shaped and patient; your knife still feels the steady, curious pressure, like a palm hovering just shy of your face.

### Turn 126 [PLAYER]

I keep my knife steady in the pressure and murmur toward the bruised glass, “No names, then—only a direction: *out and back again*,” and I wait a beat to feel whether it bites at my throat or settles at my boots. 

Without looking up, I whisper to Nail Jun, “If you cut the line, you cut your way home too—so stay close and keep your pin off my page,” then, to the door, “What toll do you take for passage—chalk, breath, or a memory I can spare?”

*Agent reasoning: The door reacts differently to “names” vs “directions,” so I’ll test it with a harmless direction-pledge and probe for what it costs before stepping through; also Nail Jun’s “cut the line” threat makes me secure my group and keep leverage.*

### Turn 127 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** the bruised lantern does **not** bite at your throat.

When you murmur, “No names—only a direction: *out and back again*,” the pressure that’s been testing your knife-tip slides down—past wrist, elbow, ribs—until it settles heavy at your boots, like a careful hand choosing your footing. The bruised glass darkens a shade, then “relaxes” into a steadier listen. Your teeth stop aching for half a breath.

You’re still on the chalk-nicked stone at the seam’s left skirt. The moon-sour alley-mouth is a few paces ahead and slightly inward; its edge looks damp, throat-wet, and the smell of wet paper is stronger now—ledger-rain and old sap.

Nail Jun’s shoulders tighten at your whisper. Their thumb comes off the pin at their cuff as if it burned them. “Fair,” they breathe, voice low. “I don’t want to be stranded in a joke-road either.” They edge closer without stepping into your nicks, holding their shuttered lantern angled down so it won’t “introduce” itself to the bruised glass. “If this thing starts asking after *who*, not *where*, I’m dragging you back by your collar.”

You ask the door its toll—chalk, breath, or memory.

The lantern answers in three small, precise ways:

First, a faint chalky taste blooms on your tongue, like you licked a slate: **it recognizes chalk** as a language.

Second, your uneven breath catches—just once—as if something tried to count it and gave up: **it wants breath, but only as rhythm**, not as a name-tag.

Third, the bruised glass clouds with a pale smear that resembles handwriting you almost remember—then refuses to resolve: **it can take memory**, but it’s picky, and it won’t take a “spare” you don’t truly own.

After clicks behind you, one syllable late, almost warning: “Toll is what makes a door a door.”

From deeper in the fog seam behind, the rim-chuckle shifts closer again—quiet, patient—like it’s realized you’ve found a way out and wants to be present when you pay.

**Status updates**
- Door accepts “out-and-back” direction

### Turn 128 [PLAYER]

I wet my thumb, scrape a little chalk from my nicked blade-edge, and draw a small moth-and-arrow sigil on the stone at the alley-mouth—an “out-and-back” mark—then I breathe the uneven rhythm into it once, like tapping a code. “Chalk for the map, breath for the meter—no names,” I whisper, and I step only one foot toward the throat-wet edge, pausing to see if it tries to take more.  

“Nail Jun—right behind me, lantern down. If it asks *who*, yank me back.”

*Agent reasoning: The door prefers directions and recognizes chalk; paying with chalk seems safest compared to memory. I want to test a controlled breath-rhythm too, but keep it minimal, and keep Jun close while watching for the seam’s chuckle creeping in.*

### Turn 129 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** the bruise-lantern *accepts* your toll—then tests the boundary.

Your wet thumb drags chalk from the nicked blade-edge easily; the moth-and-arrow sigil goes down crisp on the stone right at the alley-mouth’s throat-wet lip. When you breathe your uneven rhythm into it, the chalk briefly *darkens* as if it drank the pattern, then pales back—leaving a faint afterimage that sits a fraction of a blink behind reality.

The pressure that had been resting at your boots shifts forward, guiding—almost courteous. You step one foot toward the edge.

The alley-mouth doesn’t snap. Instead, it **takes exactly one extra thing** you didn’t offer: the *warmth* off your exhale, not the breath itself. Your throat stays yours—no tug at your name—yet your next inhale comes in a shade colder, like you’ve stepped near a cellar.

The bruised lantern gives a quiet, bruised *hummm*—not a word, more like a satisfied stamp on a page. The throat-wet edge thins, becoming less like flesh and more like a narrow, damp curtain you could part.

**Sensory grounding:** you’re at the seam’s inward verge now; behind you, the chalk-nicked stones still mark your safe skirt. The alley-mouth is directly ahead, close enough that the wet-paper smell coats your tongue.

Nail Jun moves in tight behind you, lantern kept down and shuttered as ordered. “Good,” they whisper, and you hear them *force* their breathing to match yours—trying to avoid giving the door a separate rhythm to latch onto. “It’s taking heat, not identity. That’s… as clean as these things get.”

From the fog behind, the seam-chuckle creeps nearer, annoyed and hungry, as if it’s watching you slip a leash. At the same time, the bruised glass briefly clouds with pale strokes—almost letters—then aborts them, like it tried to ask *who* and remembered your terms.

After clicks once, late: “Door agreed. Door curious.”

**Status updates**
- Toll paid: chalk + rhythm  
- Door took breath-warmth (minor)

### Turn 130 [PLAYER]

I lean in just enough to peer past the damp curtain without crossing fully, sniffing for ink, oil, or lantern-smoke, and I whisper, “Show me the *out* side first—no faces, no names—just the first landmark.”

Then I slip my second foot through in one smooth step, keeping my breath uneven and low. “Jun—now. Stay on my rhythm; if anything tries to write us, we back out on the moth mark.”

*Agent reasoning: The door is passable but curious and already stole warmth; I want to gather clues without giving it a name, and I’m also wary of the seam-chuckle closing in, so I’ll probe quickly then commit through with Jun close behind.*

### Turn 132 [PLAYER]

I hold half-in, half-out at the damp curtain, breathing low and uneven, and whisper, “Out-side first—show me the first landmark, no names.” I listen for any answering hum or scratch of “writing,” sniff for ink/oil/lantern-smoke, and only if it stays on directions—not identities—do I step fully through and motion Jun to match my rhythm right behind me.

*Agent reasoning: There’s no description of what’s beyond the curtain yet; my curiosity wants to probe the “out” side for sensory clues and landmarks while keeping our exit plan anchored to the moth mark.*

### Turn 134 [PLAYER]

I freeze at the damp curtain with one foot braced back on the chalk-nicked stone and call softly, “After—Jun—do you see anything? What’s on the out-side?”  
I keep my breath uneven and ask the door again, “First landmark only—no names,” then wait, listening for any hum or scratch like writing before I move.

*Agent reasoning: The screen is blank, so I need to probe the environment and ask for a clear description before committing to stepping through.*

### Turn 135 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** the door answers—carefully—and Jun confirms there’s an “out-side,” but it’s trying to turn your request into a *record*.

Held half-in, half-out, you keep your uneven breath low. The damp curtain trembles once, like skin deciding not to flinch. The bruise-lantern gives a soft, bruised *hummm*—then a **scratch-sound** follows, faint as a quill on wet bark.

Not writing your name—yet. Writing *around* you.

A pale cartouche-stroke blooms on the inside of the curtain, aborts, blooms again, and finally resolves into a simple, sanctioned-looking glyph: **a mile-marker shape** (a rounded post) with a **single notch** carved near its base. No letters. No date. Just the symbol, repeated twice, as if the door is saying: *first landmark: mile-marker.*

The sniff tells the rest: **lamp-oil** (old, bitter), and a thin thread of **ink** like crushed beetle-shell—Cartouche Court ink, or something mimicking it. Under that, a colder smell: damp stone that’s been recently *handled*.

Behind you, on the chalk-nicked stone, the moth sigil’s afterimage flutters half a blink late—still holding.

Jun leans forward enough that you feel their coat brush your shoulder, lantern shutter still down. “I see it,” they whisper. “It’s… a post. Not wood. Stone, maybe. And—Eldrin—there’s a second thing: a listening lantern *beyond* it. Farther in. Like it wants to be noticed.” They swallow, forcing their breath to stay off-kilter with yours. “Also—someone’s been here. Foot-scuffs in the grit on the other side. Recent.”

**Multiple active threads:** the scratch-writing on the curtain keeps *trying* to complete itself into proper cartouche script (it hesitates every time your breath stutters); from deeper in, a distant chime rings one syllable late—close enough to be a lure; and behind, the fog seam’s chuckle thickens, as if it’s pressing up the alley to see whether you commit.

**Environmental context:** the longer you hover in the threshold, the more the curtain behaves like a clerk with a pen—patient, persistent, eager to “file” you.

### Turn 136 [PLAYER]

I step fully through in one smooth motion, then immediately reach back to smear the edge of my moth-and-arrow chalk mark into a rough blur—enough to keep it from becoming a neat “signature,” but leaving a clear return-smudge for us.  

In a low whisper to Jun, “Stay tight, lantern down—eyes on the ground first,” and I crouch to read the foot-scuffs’ direction and weight as we move toward the stone mile-marker.  

Without looking at the listening lantern, I murmur toward the air, “No filing—only passage,” and I tap my uneven rhythm twice against my thigh to keep us synced.

*Agent reasoning: The threshold is trying to “file” me; hovering seems dangerous. I want to commit to the out-side quickly while keeping a clean way back, and investigate the mile-marker and those recent scuffs without letting the listening lantern “notice” us first.*

### Turn 137 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** you get through cleanly, and the threshold stops trying to “complete” you—but it notices the smear. The chalk blur works: it’s no longer a neat signature, yet it still reads as a return-mark to *your* eye.

Your boot clears the damp curtain in one smooth pull of motion. The air on this side is colder and tastes faintly of sugared rot. Behind you, where the moth-and-arrow had been crisp, you drag your fingers through the chalk: the symbol collapses into a rough, wing-shaped smear with a deliberate tail. The curtain gives a tiny, offended *tch*—not a voice, more like a pen cap snapping shut.

To your left (northward), the ground slopes up in a way stone shouldn’t. Ahead, maybe thirty paces, the **stone mile-marker** rises from moss-slick flagging like a tooth. Farther beyond it—off to the right, half-buried in fog—something lantern-shaped sits at waist height, the air around it bruised darker, as if it’s listening hard.

Jun stays tight behind you, lantern shutter down like you asked. They don’t look up. “Ground first,” they whisper back, and you feel them match your double-tap rhythm—slightly delayed at first, then syncing.

Crouched, you read the scuffs: **two sets**. One is light and quick—small steps, toe-heavy, someone trying not to leave a story. The other is heavier, heel-first, with a faint drag on the right side as if the boot sole is torn or the wearer favors a leg. Both sets angle **toward the mile-marker**, then break: the lighter set veers wide around it; the heavier goes straight up to it and stops.

When you murmur, “No filing—only passage,” the air tightens. The scratch-writing you heard before doesn’t return; instead, a thin film of moisture on the stones near your smeared mark briefly beads into **almost-letters**—then your uneven breathing ruins their alignment and they collapse back into ordinary damp.

Jun lifts two fingers and points without raising their gaze. “There’s grit piled at the base of the marker,” they say. “Like someone scraped mud off there. And—Moth—listen.” A distant chime rings again, one syllable late… but closer now, as if it’s walking toward your heartbeat rather than your ears.

**Environmental context:** lingering too long near the mile-marker feels like standing at a clerk’s desk: the fog stills, waiting for you to “state your business.” The listening lantern’s presence presses at the edge of your attention, trying to make eye-contact without eyes.

**Status updates:**  
- Threshold mark: blurred, usable  
- Tracks: two sets, recent  
- Chime: drawing nearer

### Turn 138 [PLAYER]

I keep my eyes on the stones and shuffle-crouch to the mile-marker’s base, using my blade-tip to sift the grit for anything mixed in (wax flakes, paper pulp, ink crust, boot-leather). “Jun—don’t look at the lantern thing; watch the fog behind us and tell me if the chime gets closer.”  

Without speaking a name, I whisper to the mile-marker, “Just direction—where does the light-footed trail go when it skirts you?” and I mark the heavier heel-drag stop-point with a small chalk dash on the ground.

*Agent reasoning: The mile-marker feels like a clerk’s desk—dangerous to “declare” anything. I want clues from the grit and tracks without letting the listening lantern hook my attention, and I want an escape plan if the chime closes in.*

### Turn 139 [GAME]

You shuffle-crouch to the mile-marker’s base and sift the grit with your map-knife tip. **Immediate outcome:** you find evidence of *handling*—and a tiny bit of “filing”—but the mile-marker doesn’t speak back in words. It answers by *tilting the story the tracks are telling*.

At the marker’s foot (just ahead, slightly uphill), the grit is piled in a neat crescent where someone scraped their soles clean. Your blade lifts out:

- **A wax flake**, dark and clove-scented—like a seal from a bottle-wrap, or a candle drip that’s been carried.
- **Paper pulp** mashed into the mud, fibrous and gray, with one thread that looks like it once belonged to a rumor-card.
- A pinhead **crust of glossy ink**, beetle-black. Court-ink… or a counterfeit trying to pass as Court-ink.
- **Boot-leather dust** and a single short **bristle** (not hair—more like brush-fiber), the kind used to clean cartouche grooves.

You whisper to Jun to watch the fog. Jun obeys without looking up, body angled back toward the threshold smear. “Chime’s closer,” they murmur. “Not loud—*near*. Like it’s behind my teeth.” They swallow hard, then add, “Fog’s… thickening in a line. Like a person standing just out of sight.”

When you whisper to the mile-marker—*just direction*—the stone doesn’t answer aloud. Instead, the **light-footed track** becomes easier to read for one breath: a faint moth-dust shimmer outlines where it skirted the marker—wide to the right, curving to keep the marker between itself and the listening lantern. The shimmer fades the moment you try to look directly at where it leads, but your peripheral catches the arc: it’s heading toward a narrow seam in the fog where the stones are less wet, like a path that’s been recently *avoided* by moisture.

Your chalk dash marks the heavier heel-drag stop-point. As the chalk touches down, the mile-marker’s moss twitches, and a shallow groove on the stone’s face—almost like handwriting that’s been sanded off—briefly darkens with damp, as if the marker is remembering being read.

Behind you, the listening lantern gives no light—only a soft pressure in the air, attentive, patient, as though waiting for someone to look up and “confirm.”

**Status updates:**  
- Grit: wax, pulp, ink, brush-bristle found

### Turn 140 [PLAYER]

I pinch the wax flake and ink-crust into a scrap of cloth pocket-lining, then rub a little grit over the bundle so it doesn’t shine. To Jun, still low: “We take the dry seam—right, wide—no looking up; if the chime gets teeth, we turn back on the smear.”  

Keeping my gaze down and sideways, I start along the less-wet stones where the light-footed trail curved, and I flick a small chalk mote behind us every few paces—messy dots, not a line—just enough to feel our way back without drawing a map for whatever’s listening.

*Agent reasoning: The evidence suggests someone filed/cleaned cartouche grooves and dropped rumor-card pulp—dangerous. The light-footed trail avoids the listening lantern, so I’ll follow it, but I want a quick sample of the wax/ink for later and I need to keep the fog “standing” thing from getting a clean read on us.*

### Turn 141 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** you secure the evidence without catching the lantern’s “attention-glint,” and your backtrail becomes *usable to you* without becoming a clean story for anything listening. The dry seam takes you away from the mile-marker’s clerkish stillness—though something in the fog starts to pace your rhythm.

You pinch the wax flake and ink crust into a torn bit of pocket-lining, grit it over until it’s just another dirty wad. The moment the glossy edge disappears, the air pressure eases a fraction—as if you denied the listening lantern a reflective “eye.”

You and Jun move wide-right along the less-wet stones where the light-footed trail had skirted. The seam is real: the flagging here feels slightly warmer under the pads of your feet, like it’s been recently walked and the damp didn’t have time to settle. Behind you, every few paces, you flick a chalk mote—messy, irregular dots that read more like dropped dust than a route.

Jun keeps their gaze down, lantern shutter still closed. “Chime’s… trying,” they whisper. “It’s matching our double-tap now. Half a beat late. Like it’s learning.” They glance (still downward) toward your last chalk dot. “Your dots don’t feel like a line. Good. Lines get… adopted.”

To your left-rear (back toward the mile-marker), the fog thickens into that upright suggestion again—no face, no outline, just the sense of a standing patience. It doesn’t rush you. It simply remains where a person *would* stand to be noticed.

Ahead, the dry seam narrows between two stones that sweat less than everything around them. In the gap, something pale is caught at ankle height: **a thread of paper-fiber**, snagged like lint on a thorn—rumor-card stock, torn. It flutters without wind, tugging subtly toward the right, as if the light-footed trail left a breadcrumb on purpose.

**Environmental context:** the longer you keep moving in synced, uneven rhythm, the less the “filing” takes hold—but the chime is close enough now that if it ever lands perfectly on your beat, it’ll feel like it has permission to step where you step.

**Status updates:**  
- Evidence bundled, dulled

### Turn 142 [PLAYER]

I pause just short of the narrow gap and deliberately break our rhythm—three taps instead of two—then crouch and pinch the paper-fiber thread between two fingers, testing if it’s glued, pinned, or snagged on something sharper than stone. “Jun, keep your eyes down but tell me if the chime tries to match the new count—or if the fog steps closer.”

*Agent reasoning: The paper-fiber looks like an intentional breadcrumb; I want to inspect it without giving the listening lantern a “perfect beat” to latch onto, and keep Jun monitoring the fog.*

### Turn 143 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** breaking the rhythm works—*too* well. The chime hesitates, misses your third tap, then scrambles to catch up; the fog behind you takes a small, measurable step closer as if offended by being un-synced. The paper-fiber thread isn’t glued: it’s **snagged on something finer than stone**.

You’re still on the **dry seam (right-skirt path)**, just short of the narrow gap where two less-sweating stones pinch together. The stones here feel faintly warm through your soles, like they remember feet.

You crouch and pinch the pale fiber between two fingers. It tugs—not stuck by paste, but **hooked**. When you pull gently sideways, it slides a hair’s breadth and you feel the catch: a **thin metal burr** embedded in the seam, needle-fine, like a broken staple or a sliver of lantern-brass. The fiber itself is rumor-card stock, torn into a filament—someone shredded a card on purpose and left a single strand as a guide.

Jun stays low, eyes down so hard their lashes almost brush their cheeks. “Chime didn’t like that,” they whisper. “It tried to copy the third tap and… failed. It’s angry-close now. And the fog—” Their voice thins. “The fog *moved*. One step. Not drifting. Stepping.”

Behind you, the upright thickness in the fog is nearer by a few paces—still featureless, but now close enough that the air at your nape feels chilled, like a held breath. Off to the right-front, beyond the pinch-gap, the dry seam continues for at least another ten paces before it vanishes into wetter stone again; the listening lantern’s pressure is weaker here, but not gone—more like a listener leaning back, still paying attention.

As you hold the fiber, a faint, almost-ink smell rises from the burr, and your fingertips pick up a smear of **black residue**—not enough to drip, just enough to mark you if someone “files” by touch.

**Environmental context:** staying paused while the chime is trying to learn your cadence gives it time to “lock on.” Movement with broken, irregular rhythm seems to keep it from fully matching, but it also provokes the fog-thing into more deliberate behavior.

**Status updates:**  
- Chime: desynced, angry-close  
- Fog presence: stepped nearer  
- Fiber: snagged on brass burr

### Turn 144 [PLAYER]

I wipe my fingertips hard on my trouser seam to dull the black smear, then use my blade to pry the needle-burr up and flick it away without looking back. “Jun—move, now; keep the count broken,” I whisper, and I slip through the narrow gap along the dry seam, tapping a jittery, irregular pattern as I go.

*Agent reasoning: We can’t linger while the chime learns us; I want the clue but not the ink-mark. I’ll free the fiber fast, avoid touching the residue, and slip through the gap with an irregular rhythm to keep it from syncing.*

### Turn 145 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** the smear dulls and stops “catching” the air, and you successfully lever the needle-burr free—but the moment it comes loose, it makes a tiny *tink* that the fog answers with a closer hush, like cloth dragged over teeth. Your irregular tapping keeps the chime from locking onto you as you slip through the gap.

Your trouser seam takes the worst of the black residue; it turns from glossy beetle-ink to a dry soot-stain. When your map-knife tip pries under the burr, it resists like it’s been seated with intent. It pops free at last—lantern-brass, needle-thin—and you flick it away without looking back. It skitters once, twice… then goes silent too quickly, as if it fell into something softer than stone.

You slide through the narrow gap on the dry seam. The air on the far side is a shade less damp, and the stones underfoot are warmer, almost body-warm. To your right, a low runnel (no water, just a darker groove) curls alongside the seam like a smile-line.

Jun follows tight, shoulders hunched, eyes down. They imitate your broken count—messy, unkind to patterns. “Good,” they breathe. “It’s trying to count and it keeps… stuttering.” Then, quieter: “But the fog’s closer. I can feel it learning where my spine is.”

Behind you, the chime-note doesn’t match anymore; it *hunts*, throwing half-beats like pebbles. The upright fog-thickness doesn’t rush, but it **does** cross the place where the burr used to be, and the air briefly tightens—as if something checked for a missing tooth.

Ahead, ten paces on, the dry seam ends in a patch of wet stone—except for a **single pale cartouche-scratch** on the nearest tree-root to the left, freshly inked or freshly exposed, shaped like a sideways moth-wing. It wasn’t there a moment ago… or it wasn’t visible until you broke the rhythm.

**Environmental context:** lingering lets the chime “average” your irregularity; moving keeps it guessing, but every sharp sound (metal on stone, breath caught) seems to give the fog-thing a more definite place to stand.

**Status updates:**  
- Brass burr removed; noise made  
- Chime: hunting, not synced  
- Fog presence: closer, deliberate

### Turn 146 [PLAYER]

I keep moving, but angle left toward the tree-root, still tapping an irregular, ugly rhythm; I crouch and look at the sideways moth-wing scratch from the corner of my eye, tracing its edges with my blade-tip without fully “reading” it. In a breath to Jun: “Tell me if the fog closes when I touch this—if it does, we bolt across the wet patch, no hesitation.”

*Agent reasoning: The new moth-wing cartouche on the tree-root feels like a clue left by the light-footed trail; I want to inspect it without giving the fog/chime a stable pattern, and I need a plan for the seam ending in wet stone.*

### Turn 147 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** you manage to “trace without reading”—and the cartouche reacts like a thing that hates being handled gently. The sideways moth-wing scratch **doesn’t flare**; instead it **re-inks under your blade-tip**, trying to complete itself into legible script. Jun catches the shift: the fog doesn’t lunge, but it **tightens its distance** as if your touch gave it a cleaner address.

You’re still on the **dry seam (far side of pinch-gap)**, angled left toward a tree-root that bulges out of the stone like a knuckle. The root’s surface is slick with sap that smells faintly of old paper.

You keep your ugly, jitter rhythm going—tap-scrape, pause, tap—while crouched. From the corner of your eye, the moth-wing mark looks like two strokes at first… but as your blade-tip traces the edge, the pale line **grows a hair’s breadth**, filling in behind the metal with fresh, damp ink the color of bruised bark. It’s trying to become a full cartouche sentence. You feel it in your teeth: the itch of being “named.”

Jun’s whisper is immediate, controlled. “Fog closed—half a step. It’s… listening through the root.” They swallow. “Chime’s still hunting. It’s throwing beats at us like it wants us to answer.”

Behind you, the upright fog-thickness is nearer now, close enough that the air at your back feels pressed-flat. Not a grab—more like someone standing too close in a corridor. And somewhere beyond the wet patch ahead, a single off-key chime-note arrives late, as if testing whether you’ll correct it.

The cartouche keeps trying to finish itself under your blade. If you linger another breath, it’ll become readable whether you want it to or not—your peripheral glance is already starting to *understand* the curve.

**Environmental context:** this root is a live “scribe.” Touching it invites completion; completion invites filing. Your irregular rhythm is buying you time, but not safety—sound and attention are stacking.

**Status updates:**
- Cartouche: re-inking, completing
- Fog: closed distance, steady
- Chime: hunting, probing beats

### Turn 148 [PLAYER]

I hiss, “No—no names,” and smear the freshening ink sideways with the flat of my blade, scarring the moth-wing into an unreadable blot. “Jun, now—run,” and I bolt across the wet patch with a deliberately chaotic stomp-and-skip rhythm, refusing to answer any chime-beat even if it matches.

*Agent reasoning: The root is trying to “name” me; that’s dangerous. I still want a clue, so I’ll disrupt the script without reading it, then move fast across the wet patch before the fog can capitalize on the address.*

### Turn 149 [GAME]

You smear the fresh ink hard—**and it works**, in the way ripping a tongue out “works.”

The moth-wing cartouche **fails to complete** into readable script; the neat pale lines collapse into a bruised, sideways blot with a long scar through it. For a heartbeat the tree-root goes slick and numb under your blade, then the sap smell spikes—paper and panic. Behind you, the fog-thickness **stutters** like it lost a handle on you… and then it compensates by pressing forward, closer than comfort.

You and Jun bolt across the wet patch. The stone there is slick with cold sweat; your stomp-and-skip rhythm splashes dark beads that don’t fall straight—they hesitate, then slide *uphill* a finger’s width before surrendering to gravity. You refuse every chime-beat, even when it lands perfectly on your heel.

Jun runs on your left shoulder, breath sawing. “Good—good—don’t answer it,” they rasp, and you hear real fear under the training. “If you answer, it *pins* you. Nails you to a count.” As you clear the wet patch, Jun’s sleeve brushes yours and you feel them flinch like they touched a hot wire. “Fog’s right behind—closer than before.”

The chime-note behind you turns ugly, no longer hunting—**accusing**, as if you broke a contract. In the corner of your hearing, a second, fainter chime joins in from ahead-right, a delayed echo that suggests there’s another hanger nearby… or the first is bouncing off something hollow.

Just past the wet stone, the seam becomes dry again, but narrower, squeezed between two leaning trunks whose bark is crowded with half-erased cartouches. Between those trunks, a listening-lantern glow (not a lantern you can see—more like amber attention in the air) **tilts toward you**, bruising the fog into a denser outline for an instant.

**Environmental pressure:** the tree-root you scarred will be “reported” in the Court’s language—damaged cartouches draw attention. The chimes are trying to reassert a shared rhythm; your chaos is protection, but it’s loud protection.

**Status updates:**
- Cartouche: smeared, unreadable  
- Fog: momentarily lost, then closer  
- Chimes: accusatory, echoing ahead

### Turn 150 [PLAYER]

I skid to a half-stop just before the leaning trunks, keeping my feet jittering in a messy, off-count shuffle, and I angle my body so I can peer between the bark-scripts without staring straight at them. “Jun—what are these half-erased cartouches? Do they *erase* people, or hide them?” I tilt my head toward the ahead-right echo. “And that second chime—another hanger, or a hollow we can duck into?”

*Agent reasoning: The leaning trunks with half-erased cartouches feel like a trap or a clue; the second chime ahead-right could mean another threat or an exit. I want to learn without getting “pinned,” so I’ll slow just enough to assess, keep rhythm chaotic, and ask Jun what they know about these cartouches and the echo.*

### Turn 151 [GAME]

Your half-stop **doesn’t break the chase**, but it does break the *pattern*—the chimes can’t quite “land” on you while your feet keep that ugly shuffle. The fog behind you compresses at the mouth of the wet patch, as if the smeared cartouche cost it certainty; it advances anyway, but slower, feeling for the count you refuse to give.

You’re wedged just before the **two leaning trunks**, their bark packed with half-scraped cartouches like verdicts someone tried to sand off. The air between them is drier—papery—while to the ahead-right the echoing chime-note comes from a shallow dip where the ground drops like a swallowed breath.

Jun keeps their back half-turned, eyes flicking between the trunks and the fog. “Half-erased cartouches do both,” they say, voice tight. “Erase if you match the Court’s wording—if you let it *finish you*. Hide if you stay unfiled. People who survive here learn to be… grammatically wrong.”

As you peer without staring, you catch it: a **tiny comma-shaped scar** in the bark on the left trunk, only visible from the corner of your eye. It smells like old paper and fresh sap. And the nearest chime—somewhere not far—rings **one beat late**, as if apologizing after the fact. The comma-scar points—not like an arrow, more like a suggestion—toward the ahead-right dip.

Jun follows your tilt toward the echo. “Second chime isn’t a hanger,” they whisper. “It’s a hollow. Sound’s bouncing off a pocket—like a throat-cleft. We can duck in, but hollows have rules. They make you… *agree* to things without saying yes.”

Between the leaning trunks, the bark-scripts subtly rearrange—pale strokes tightening around the space you’re standing in, eager to become a sentence with you inside it. The listening-lantern attention in the air also leans, bruising the fog’s edge into a clearer outline for a blink—enough to tell it’s almost within arm’s reach now, but still cautious of your chaos.

**Status updates:**  
- Fog: slowed, still closing  
- Cartouches: rearranging, hungry for “sense”  
- Ahead-right echo: hollow-pocket confirmed

### Turn 152 [PLAYER]

Keeping my feet in that ugly shuffle, I flick two fingers toward the comma-scar without looking straight at it. “Comma says *pause*, not *end*—we take the dip.”  

To Jun, low and fast: “If the hollow tries to make us agree, we answer with nonsense—broken grammar, no true yes.” Then I sidestep out from between the leaning trunks and hurry toward the ahead-right throat-cleft, keeping the rhythm chaotic and my eyes down.

*Agent reasoning: The trunks feel like they’re trying to “sentence” us, so lingering is dangerous; the hollow sounds risky but offers cover. I’m curious about the comma-scar and want to use it as a guide without letting the cartouches “finish” me.*

### Turn 153 [GAME]

You flick two fingers toward the comma-scar without giving it your full gaze. **Immediate outcome:** the comma doesn’t “point” so much as **permits**—the rearranging bark-scripts between the leaning trunks hesitate, as if accepting a pause-clause instead of a full stop. The air-pressure of the listening-lantern slackens for a blink, and that blink is enough.

You sidestep out of the cramped gap and hurry toward the ahead-right dip, feet still doing that chaotic stomp-and-skip. The ground drops a half-body height into a shallow cleft where the fog tastes more like burnt wick than rot. A thin runnel of water is there—moving uphill with quiet, rude insistence—threading between stones like it’s trying to leave.

Jun follows tight, keeping their breath inside their mouth. “Broken grammar,” they echo, like they’re holding the idea between their teeth. “Good. Hollows can’t file nonsense.”

Behind you, the fog-thickness reaches the leaning trunks and **stalls**—not stopped, just slowed—pressing at the space as if it needs the trunks to “approve” pursuit. The chime that had turned accusatory now splits into two layers: the late beat behind, and the ahead-right echo that becomes louder as you descend, no longer accusatory—more like a mouth practicing your cadence.

Inside the throat-cleft, the sound behaves wrong. Your footfalls come back **re-ordered**, as if the hollow is trying to straighten your chaos into a march. The walls are close—bark and stone sweating together—and pale cartouche-flecks drift in the air like dandruff.

A voice that isn’t a voice slides up from the cleft’s deeper pocket, borrowing your own consonants: “Ag—ree—?” It’s not asking like a person. It’s testing whether you’ll give it a clean “yes” to hang you from.

Jun answers first, fast and ugly, exactly as you coached: “Yeh—no—if—when. Wasn’t. Mightn’t. Who’s asking?” Their eyes stay down, jaw clenched.

The hollow shivers, displeased. The uphill water-runner chuckles once—quietly—like it enjoyed Jun’s refusal.

**Environmental context:** the cleft buys concealment and slows the fog, but it tries to *regularize* sound; if your rhythm becomes orderly or your words become affirmative, it can “seat” you here like a clause that can’t end.

**Status updates:**  
- Leaning trunks: pursuit slowed  
- Throat-cleft: sound re-orders steps  
- Hollow: probing for agreement

### Turn 154 [PLAYER]

I keep my feet scuffing in a nasty, uneven shuffle and answer the hollow without giving it a clean word: “Aye-nay-maybe; left-right-lantern; moth-math—no.” Then I crouch by the uphill runnel, watching how it climbs and where it’s trying to go, and I murmur to Jun, “That water’s fleeing—see if there’s a crack it’s pointing to. And don’t let your steps turn into a march.”

*Agent reasoning: The hollow is trying to force order and a clean “yes,” so I’ll answer with deliberate nonsense while investigating the uphill-running water as a possible path or clue, keeping my rhythm irregular and eyes down to avoid “reading” anything.*

### Turn 155 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** your scrambled answer lands like grit in a gear. The hollow tries to catch a clean “aye” or “no” and gets neither; the probing “Ag—ree—?” falters, then withdraws into a sulky hiss. The re-ordering of your footfalls weakens—your scuffed shuffle stays yours.

Crouched in the throat-cleft, you watch the uphill runnel. It isn’t just climbing; it’s **choosing**—skirting certain stones as if they’re hot, then hugging a seam in the cleft’s right wall (east side), where bark gives way to slick, dark rock. The water gathers there, trembling, and slips into a hairline crack that shouldn’t take more than a bead at a time. It takes it anyway, greedily.

Jun keeps moving in ugly half-steps, resisting the hollow’s urge to turn them into a metronome. They squat beside you without fully stopping, eyes tracking the runnel. “That’s a drain,” they whisper. “Not natural. Court doesn’t like drains—they can’t write them clean.” Jun presses two fingers near the crack but doesn’t touch it outright. “Hear that?”

From inside the crack: a **faint chime**, not rung but muffled—like metal wrapped in cloth. The echo you followed isn’t just bounce; there’s something *hanging* beyond, hidden behind rock and bark. The hollow reacts to the sound with irritation, pushing a soft pressure against your ears, trying to smooth your breathing into an agreeable rhythm.

Behind you, up-slope toward the leaning trunks, the fog has found patience. It can’t file through fast, but it **seeps** along the edges, testing the cleft’s mouth. In the bruised amber attention overhead, the listening-lantern “tilt” returns in brief pulses, as if someone outside is searching by ear.

Jun murmurs, “If we pry that crack, it might open into a pocket-route. But if it’s Guild-work, it’ll want a payment—laughter, interest, a name.” Their gaze flicks to your clove-wrapped bottle, then away, pretending they didn’t look.

**Status updates:**  
- Hollow’s “agreement” probe: disrupted  
- Uphill runnel: feeding a hidden crack  
- Fog: seeping toward cleft-mouth

### Turn 156 [PLAYER]

I pull the clove-wrapped bottle halfway out and unstopper it just enough to let a thin ribbon of scent spill—then I cork it again, like a stingy bribe. “No names,” I whisper to the crack, and I tap three off-beat knuckle-raps on the rock beside it—wrong rhythm on purpose.

To Jun, quick: “Hold the cleft-mouth—throw it a nonsense answer if it presses you.” Then I slide my blade-tip into the hairline seam and try to pry it open a fraction, watching the uphill water to see if it thickens or changes course.

*Agent reasoning: The drain-crack feels like a secret route and I want to investigate it, but the “payment” risk is real; I’ll try a cheap offering (sound/scent) that isn’t a name, and keep resisting the hollow’s rhythm while watching the fog*

### Turn 157 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** the stingy spill of clove-sweet laughter-scent *takes*. Not like a payment accepted—more like a throat swallowing a crumb. The hairline crack drinks the smell; the uphill runnel immediately **thickens**, its surface tightening as if it’s suddenly more “certain” it has somewhere to go.

Your three off-beat raps land wrong on purpose. The hollow flinches at the rhythm, and the pressure in your ears loosens. When you slide the tip of your map-knife into the seam and pry, the rock doesn’t give like stone— it gives like **dried bark-paste**, cracking with a papery snap. The seam opens a fraction… then a fraction more, as if it’s embarrassed to be seen.

A slit of darkness appears—deeper than the cleft’s shadow—and with it a muffled chime-note, cloth-wrapped and patient. The uphill water threads straight into the opening now, no longer searching.

**Sensory grounding:** you’re still crouched in the throat-cleft’s right wall; behind and upslope (west), the cleft-mouth is a pale oval where fog presses in slow sheets.

Jun backs toward that oval, keeping their feet ugly and unsynchronized. When the fog tests forward, Jun answers it through clenched teeth, nonsense and refusal: “Was-wasn’t. Here-there. Filed-unfiled.” Their voice shakes, but the fog hesitates, as if it can’t find a form to pour into.

From the new slit, something *whispers* without words—a dry inhale. The bark around the opening tries to grow pale cartouches, but they stutter and smear, unable to settle on a lawful sentence. A thin thread of amber attention—listening-lantern pressure—touches the cleft-mouth, like someone outside just noticed a draft.

Jun glances over their shoulder at you. “Good pry,” they hiss. “But that smell? Guild lamps track that kind of clove like dogs. If we go in, go fast—and don’t say your name even in your head.”

**Environmental context:** the slit is open enough to squeeze a shoulder through; the fog is still held at the mouth by Jun’s nonsense, but the outside “listening” has started to focus.

**Status updates:**  
- Crack-route: opened to a slit  
- Uphill runnel: committed, flowing in  
- Fog: stalled, still probing  
- Listening attention: narrowing on cleft-mouth

### Turn 158 [PLAYER]

I tuck the clove bottle away hard and lean close to Jun. “You first—keep your nonsense between you and the mouth. I’ll follow and pull the slit wider if it bites.”  

Without thinking my name, I press my ear near the opening for one half-breath—listening for that cloth-wrapped chime—then I turn sideways and slip shoulder-first into the crack-route, dragging my off-beat shuffle with me as long as the stone allows.

*Agent reasoning: The listening attention is narrowing and Jun’s holding the fog back; the crack-route is open but risky—my curious side wants to slip in and learn what that muffled chime is, fast, before we’re cornered.*

### Turn 160 [PLAYER]

“Jun—still with me?” I keep my breath shallow and my thoughts blank of names, then feel along the inside edge of the slit with my fingertips and knife-spine, listening for that cloth-wrapped chime and any draft that suggests a wider chamber ahead.

*Agent reasoning: The “---” feels like a transition or loading beat; my priority is to keep moving through the crack-route, stay nameless, and get my bearings by listening and feeling for hazards.*

### Turn 161 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** Jun’s answer comes back, close enough to brush your ear through the slit. “Still—still. Don’t—don’t finish a sentence.” Their nonsense is quieter now, strained, but it holds; the fog-pressure that wanted to “agree” with you doesn’t follow cleanly into the crack.

You feel along the inside edge with fingertips and the knife-spine. The seam’s inner lip isn’t stone at all—it’s **laminated layers**: bark, paper-fiber, and a thin gluey resin that warms under touch like a pulse. The cloth-wrapped chime is clearer here, a soft *tick…tck* as if something metal is trying not to be heard.

A draft finds your knuckles—cool, stale, and **downward**. Not much, but steady: there’s a wider pocket beyond, and it’s breathing out through this slit.

**Sensory grounding:** you’re wedged shoulder-first in the crack-route, right side pressed to resin-slick wall; behind you (west) is the cleft-mouth, now a pale oval blocked by Jun’s hunched silhouette.

As you probe deeper, your knife-spine scrapes something that *gives* like cloth. For a heartbeat you think it’s Jun’s sleeve—then the chime-note flinches and shifts. There’s a bundle just inside, tucked into a niche: **a wind-chime wrapped in gray cloth**, tied off with paper-fiber thread like your rumor-card filament. It’s hung on a hook of lantern-brass driven into the resin—Guild hardware.

Jun whispers, “That’s a marker. Someone’s been… *routing* through here.” They swallow. “If it rings clean, the lanterns outside will hear it. Keep it muffled.”

Outside the slit, the listening attention tightens—amber pressure like a fingertip on the cleft-mouth—then slides away and back again, searching for the source of the draft. The uphill water continues to thread past you, cold against your boot, vanishing into the darkness ahead; it’s begun carrying faint motes of moth-dust shimmer, like it’s picking up residue from whatever chamber it’s feeding.

**Environmental context:** the slit is still narrow; staying wedged makes noise inevitable—scrape, breath, cloth-shift. The “listening” outside is actively sweeping, and the wrapped chime is one accidental jostle away from betraying you.

**Status updates:**  
- Jun: present, holding fog back  
- Draft: steady, downward pocket ahead  
- Wrapped chime: Guild-marked, muffled  
- Listening attention: sweeping cleft-mouth

### Turn 162 [PLAYER]

I press my palm over the cloth-wrapped chime to deaden it completely, then use my knife-spine to ease the hook loose a hair at a time—no jingling—until I can cradle the bundle against my chest.  

To Jun, a whisper with no clean end: “Marker—Guild. If it’s theirs, we borrow it… not keep—” I inch forward toward the downward draft, letting the uphill water lead, and keep my breathing chopped and ugly so nothing settles into a rhythm.

*Agent reasoning: The wrapped chime is a trap/marker; my curiosity wants to inspect it, but we can’t let it ring and the listening lantern is sweeping. I’ll secure it silently, then follow the draft/water toward the wider pocket, keeping nonsense and unfinished phrases.*

### Turn 163 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** Your palm seals the cloth tight enough that the chime-note dies in your skin—no ring, just the faintest *thrum* like a held breath. With the knife-spine you worry the lantern-brass hook loose grain by grain. The resin fights, then relents with a soft, sticky *pop*—quiet, but not nothing. The listening pressure outside the cleft-mouth twitches in response, then drifts past again, unsure.

You cradle the bundle to your chest. The cloth is damp-cool and smells faintly of lamp-oil and old paper. The paper-fiber tie is knotted in a tallyman’s style—quick, repeatable, meant for hands in gloves.

You whisper to Jun without giving the sentence a clean place to land. Jun nods hard, then adds their own broken thread of sound: “Borrow—fine. Keep—bad. Guild counts what it hangs.”

**Sensory grounding:** You’re deeper in the crack-route now, angled downward; behind you (west/up) Jun’s silhouette still blocks the pale oval of fog at the mouth, their shoulders trembling as they keep nonsense between you and it.

As you inch forward, the uphill water slips along your boot and then *tips*—it spills into the downward pocket ahead, vanishing with a quiet laugh-swallow. The draft strengthens for a moment, as if the chamber beyond just exhaled.

Jun shifts to follow, and the fog at the mouth surges a finger-width in, tasting for a rhythm. Jun immediately ruins it with a harsh, arrhythmic spit of syllables. “No—no—no. Filed—unfiled. Here—there.” The fog stalls again, but you feel its impatience like static on your neck.

The chamber ahead begins to resolve by touch and sound: a wider throat of space, lined with the same bark-paper laminate, and somewhere below—still muffled—another chime answering your stolen one, delayed by half a beat. Not a single instrument: a *network*.

**Environmental context:** The hook’s soft pop has made the outside “listening” more alert; it’s sweeping tighter patterns now. The fog can’t enter cleanly while Jun keeps breaking language, but if either of you settles into a steady breath or a complete phrase, it will find purchase.

**Status updates:**

### Turn 164 [PLAYER]

I keep the wrapped chime pinned under my forearm and creep down toward the draft, feeling for any ledge or seam with my free hand. In a whisper to Jun: “Come—slow. If the mouth pulls, cut the sound and drop—” Then I pause and try to locate that answering chime by ear, tapping the wall once with my knuckle—soft, deliberately off-time—and waiting to hear how the throat-space replies.

*Agent reasoning: There’s a chime network below and the outside listening is tightening; I want to learn what this route is without triggering a clean ring, and I don’t want Jun stuck at the mouth too long.*

### Turn 165 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** You find a seam with your free hand—an almost-invisible step where the bark-paper laminate overlaps. It’s a **narrow ledge**, just enough for the ball of your foot, and it runs down in a shallow spiral like a throat’s inner ridge. The wrapped chime stays dead under your forearm; no jingle leaks.

Your whisper to Jun lands dangerously close to a complete instruction, and the space *tries* to finish it for you—air tugging at the last word like a hooked finger. Jun snaps their teeth shut and answers with a broken, useless fragment: “Drop—*drip*—drift,” ruining the cadence. The tug eases, but not all the way.

You tap the wall once, off-time. The throat-space replies with a **delayed, mismatched echo**: not a clean reflection, but a second tap that arrives half a heartbeat late and slightly *higher*, like someone imitating you through thin metal.

That answering chime isn’t far. By the way the echo “bends,” it’s **below and to your left** (south-left in the spiral), tucked behind a thicker patch of laminate—likely another niche or a side pocket. And beneath that, you catch a faint, steady **lamp-hum**—the kind that comes from a Wickward listening lantern working hard.

**Sensory grounding:** You’re partway down the downward pocket now, one shoulder brushing resin-slick wall; above and behind (west/up), the slit-mouth is a dim oval with fog pressing at its edge like wet cloth.

Jun follows, slow as you asked, one hand splayed against the wall. They keep their breathing deliberately ugly, then whisper through clenched jaw, “Guild doesn’t hang one. They hang… *strings*. If you hear two, there’s a third that listens.”

As if to prove it, the air above the slit-mouth tightens again—listening attention narrowing on the little *pop* you made earlier, now triangulating. It can’t see you, but it’s learning the shape of your silence.

**Environmental context:** The ledge is stable but slick; a misstep will slide you down faster than you intend. The “answering” chime and lamp-hum suggest a monitored route ahead—quiet movement helps, but the network seems built to notice patterns, not just volume.

**Status updates:**  
- Ledge found: spiral descent  
- Answering chime: below-left, close  
- Listening outside: narrowing search

### Turn 166 [PLAYER]

I freeze for a count I don’t finish, then slide down the spiral ledge toward the thicker laminate below-left, keeping my shoulder and forearm braced to muffle the stolen chime. With my free hand I feel for the edge of the niche and, if I find it, I ease a fingernail under the laminate like peeling old label-paper—slow, no tear—while I whisper to Jun, “If I stop… don’t call—just… wait.”

*Agent reasoning: There’s a chime network and a listening lantern below-left; I want to investigate the niche but avoid making patterns or ringing anything, and I’m curious what the “third that listens” is.*

### Turn 167 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** You freeze mid-breath—no finished count—until the throat-space stops trying to copy you. Then you slide down the spiral ledge, shoulder and hip skimming resin-slick laminate. The thicker patch below-left is real: your fingertips find an edge where the layers overlap like old label-paper.

You ease a fingernail under it. The laminate *lifts*—slow, obedient—without tearing. Underneath is a shallow niche, and with it the source of the half-beat reply: a second **wind-chime assembly**, smaller than yours, hung on a short lantern-brass staple. Its clappers aren’t bone; they’re **thin glass reeds** wrapped in thread, tuned to answer anything that taps nearby.

As the laminate peels back a finger-width more, the lamp-hum strengthens and resolves into a **listening lantern set behind the niche**, shielded by the wall like an ear behind a hand. It isn’t lit bright; it’s “awake”—a low amber bruise of sound-pressure.

Your whisper to Jun—“If I stop… don’t call—just… wait.”—lands ragged enough to avoid snapping shut into a complete command. Jun nods once, hard, and answers with information instead of comfort: “That’s a relay. Guild uses them to… *hear routes*. If it wakes, it’ll tell the mouth where your quiet is.”

**Sensory grounding:** You’re crouched on the spiral ledge, left side pressed to the peeled laminate; above and behind (west/up) the slit-mouth is a dim oval with fog pressing like damp felt.

**Multiple active threads:**  
Jun is holding position a step above, keeping their breath ugly and their words broken as the fog at the mouth grows more certain, probing the crack’s shape. In your hands, the peeled laminate wants to stick back down—resin tack pulling at your nail. In the niche, the answering chime hangs perfectly still… but the listening lantern behind it gives a tiny sympathetic tremor, as if it felt your body heat.

**Environmental context:** The danger isn’t volume—it’s *pattern*. The relay chime is designed to “complete” rhythms and report them. The fog-mouth above is learning, and if the lantern fully wakes it can guide that listening straight down the throat.

**Status updates:**  
- Niche opened: relay chime found  
- Listening lantern: shielded, awake  
- Fog-mouth: probing, closer learned

### Turn 168 [PLAYER]

I press my palm over the glass-reed chime to keep it dead-still, then—slow and uneven—I ease the clove bottle out and smear a thin, messy streak along the niche edge and toward the lantern’s “ear,” like fouling a lens.  

To Jun, barely breath: “If it hears… it points,” and I nudge the peeled laminate back down to half-cover the niche again, leaving just enough gap to watch whether the lantern-hum dulls.

*Agent reasoning: The relay lantern is the real threat; I want to sabotage it quietly without creating a pattern the chime can “answer,” and I’m curious what makes it listen. I’ll try to smother/occlude it using what I have while keeping movements irregular.*

### Turn 169 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** Your palm clamps the glass-reed chime dead. It wants to answer—wants to *be helpful*—but the reeds can’t move under your skin. With your other hand you work the clove-wrapped bottle out and smear a thin, ugly streak along the niche lip and toward the lantern’s hidden “ear.”

The effect is immediate and satisfyingly mundane: the clove-oil and whatever else is in that bottle gums the resin and **muffles the lantern’s intake**. The amber bruise behind the laminate dims from “awake” to “drowsing,” and the hum drops a half-step, as if the ear has been stuffed with wax.

Not silent—never silent—but **less precise**.

You nudge the laminate back down to half-cover. It sticks where you want it, clove-slick acting like a bad sealant. Through the thin gap you watch the lantern’s glow blur, its attention no longer needle-fine.

**Sensory grounding:** You’re crouched on the spiral ledge, niche to your left (south-left), slit-mouth and fog above and behind (west/up). The clove stink cuts through the damp like a kitchen knife.

Jun hears your barely-breathed “If it hears… it points,” and answers with a quick, broken whisper that carries more fact than comfort: “And if it can’t point clean… it guesses. Guild hates guessing.” They edge closer, keeping their breath deliberately uneven, and glance up toward the mouth as the fog presses in a fraction—then hesitates, confused by the dulled relay.

Behind your palm, the glass reeds give a tiny, frustrated tremor against your skin—no sound, but a vibration like a trapped insect. Farther down the throat-space, that faint lamp-hum you noticed earlier doesn’t vanish; it **shifts**, as if another listener deeper in the network is compensating for the one you’ve fouled.

**Environmental context:** You’ve bought yourself cover, not safety. The relay lantern is less able to “hear routes,” which slows the fog-mouth’s learning—but the Guild’s system is layered. If you linger, the deeper listener may start triangulating by absence: noticing the *missing* reply.

**Status updates:**  
- Relay lantern: muffled, dulled  
- Relay chime: physically suppressed  
- Fog-mouth: probing, briefly confused

### Turn 170 [PLAYER]

I let the glass-reed chime go only after the laminate settles, then press my ear to the wall and listen down the throat for that deeper hum—trying to judge distance and direction. I whisper to Jun, “We move… now—no patterns,” and start sliding down the spiral ledge, dragging my knuckles along the seam as a rough guide. If the hum sharpens, I tug the stolen wrapped chime out and gently wedge it into a crack behind us—muffled—like we went the other way.

*Agent reasoning: The relay is dulled but a deeper listener is compensating; my curious side wants a quick look for what’s ahead, but we can’t linger. I’ll take one risky peek/listen downward, then move, using the stolen marker as misdirection if possible.*

### Turn 171 [GAME]

You wait until the laminate finishes its slow, tacky settle, then lift your palm. The glass reeds *want* to answer the world—one tiny tremble escapes—but the half-cover and clove-foul keep it from catching a clean rhythm. No clear ring follows.

You press your ear to the wall. The deeper hum is there: **not below-left like the relay**, but **straight down the spiral and slightly right** (deeper into the throat’s curve), maybe **two short turns** away. It isn’t a single lantern; it’s a **paired resonance**—one steady note and one faint overtone that comes and goes, like a listener “checking in.”

Your whisper to Jun—“We move… now—no patterns”—lands broken enough to avoid the tree-law’s teeth. Jun mirrors you immediately: they begin moving on *bad timing*, pausing where a person wouldn’t, breathing like a tired bellows. “If it’s paired,” they mutter, “it can argue with itself. That’s… good. Means it’s not sure.”

You slide down the spiral ledge, dragging your knuckles along the seam. The stone-sweat slicks your skin; the seam’s edge gives you a reliable, ugly guide. Behind you, up toward the slit-mouth (west/up), the fog’s pressure shifts—less confident now that the relay is dulled, but it still *listens*.

Halfway through the next turn, the hum **sharpens**, as if the deeper listener caught the scrape of your knuckles and is trying to fit it into a route-shape.

You pull the stolen cloth-wrapped Guild chime and, gentle as a bribe, wedge it into a hairline crack behind you—muffled, half-hidden—so the wall holds it like a secret. The crack steals most of its voice, but not its *presence*. The deeper hum hesitates, its overtone flickering toward that planted “signpost” for a heartbeat… then wavering, unsure whether it’s a true marker or a bad echo.

Jun sees what you did and gives you a tight nod. “Clever,” they breathe. “If it follows that, it’ll report the wrong bend. But—Moth—if a lamplighter comes to *check*… they’ll find it.”

Down the spiral, the air cools and tastes more metallic. Somewhere ahead, water runs uphill with a soft, private chuckle—close enough to be real, not rumor.

**Status updates:**  
- Deeper listener: located, nearer  
- Decoy chime: planted behind

### Turn 172 [PLAYER]

I glance back once, uneasy. “If a lamplighter comes… we’ll blame the fog,” I whisper, then keep sliding down—off-beat—toward the metallic air and that uphill chuckle. As I move, I feel the wall for any hidden latch-seams or another laminate overlap on the slightly-right side, trying to spot where the paired hum is housed without getting close enough to give it a rhythm to chew on.

*Agent reasoning: The paired hum and uphill water sound like a deeper mechanism worth investigating, but the lamplighter risk means we should keep moving fast and irregular while checking for side niches or a way to disable the listener without making a clean sound.*

### Turn 173 [GAME]

You glance back once. The spiral above is a smear of damp amber and fog-pressure; your planted Guild chime sits wedged in its crack like a swallowed tooth. The fog at the slit-mouth doesn’t surge—yet—but it **tests** the air with tiny shifts, as if waiting for the relay network to tell it which way your fear went.

“If a lamplighter comes… we’ll blame the fog,” you whisper. Jun gives a brittle little huff that’s almost a laugh but breaks itself apart in time. “Lamplighters don’t blame. They *invoice*,” they murmur, and then they move with you—off-beat, awkward, deliberately human in the wrong way.

As you slide down toward the metallic air and that uphill chuckle, you keep your knuckles off the seam now and switch to **soft, irregular touches**—pads of fingers, then nothing, then a scrape, then a pause—trying not to hand the listener a clean metronome. The wall on the slightly-right side changes texture: resin-smooth becomes **paper-fiber laminate**, then back to stone-sweat, then—there—an overlap you almost miss, because it’s *too neat*.

You find a **latch-seam**: a hairline crescent that doesn’t match the throat’s natural layers. When you press near it, the paired hum reacts—not louder, but **more focused**, like an ear turning. The overtone “checks in” twice in quick succession… then stops, as if it realized that was a pattern and bit its own tongue.

The uphill chuckle is closer now, to your lower-right: water running the wrong way through something metallic—maybe a gutter of old lantern-tin—making that private, amused sound.

Jun leans in close enough that their breath warms your wrist. “That seam?” they whisper. “Guild hides their listeners behind *service flaps*. Court hides theirs behind *cartouches*. If it’s Guild… there’ll be a tally mark. A little wick-scratch.” Their eyes flick to the wall, scanning without touching.

Behind you, faintly, the decoy chime gives one smothered, accidental tick—stone settling around it—and the deeper hum answers it with a single, irritated thrum, redirected for a heartbeat away from you. Not fooled forever. Just… delayed.

**Status updates:**  
- Latch-seam found (right wall)  
- Paired hum: focusing, cautious  
- Fog-mouth: delayed, still listening

### Turn 174 [PLAYER]

I hover my fingertips just off the latch-seam and squint for that wick-scratch tally, angling my lantern-charm and eyes to catch any tiny mark without tapping. To Jun I breathe, “If it’s a service flap… can we gum it like the last ear?” Then, using a slow, irregular pressure (no repeated beats), I try to tease the seam open a hair—just enough to peek—while keeping my body turned toward the uphill chuckle in case we need to slide away fast.

*Agent reasoning: The latch-seam likely hides the paired listener; I want to confirm if it’s Guild and sabotage it without making a clear rhythm, while also tracking that uphill water sound as a possible exit or cover.*

### Turn 176 [PLAYER]

I angle my moth-charm and squint along the latch-seam for any wick-scratch tally without touching, then breathe to Jun, “If it’s a service flap… can we gum it like the last ear?” Keeping my pressure slow and irregular, I tease the seam open the barest hair to peek inside—body still turned toward that uphill chuckle so I can slide away fast if the hum sharpens.

*Agent reasoning: The “service flap” might hide the paired listener; I want to confirm the wick-scratch and peek without giving it a clean rhythm, while keeping an exit toward the uphill water-sound.*

### Turn 177 [GAME]

The moth-charm warms against your palm as you angle it—its lantern-brass catching what little glow the listening air will spare. Along the latch-seam, a mark resolves without you touching: a **wick-scratch tally**, shallow and ugly, like someone dragged a burned pin across stone and tried to pretend it was an accident. **Guild.** Not Court.

Jun sees your eyes settle and murmurs, “Service flap, then. They hide ears where hands are supposed to go.”

You breathe, “Can we gum it like the last ear?” Jun’s mouth tightens. “Maybe. But gumming a flap can make the lanterns *hungry*—they start searching for what they can’t hear.”

You set two fingers to the seam with slow, irregular pressure—no rhythm, no repeated cadence—and the crescent gives a fraction, like a fingernail lifting. The paired hum inside **sharpens once**, then checks itself, trying not to become a predictable response.

The seam opens the barest hair. The metallic air spills out colder.

Inside: a **listening box** no bigger than your fist, riveted into a tin cradle. Its face is a thin disc of bruised glass with a **wick-filament loop** behind it—tuned to vibration. Someone has stuffed a smear of dark wax around the edges already, but it’s old and flaked; the ear has been “leaking” attention. A tiny paper tag is tied to the cradle with fiber thread: **INTEREST / DUE: next week**—the same language as your vial, but not your handwriting. Someone’s been using your debt-ink as a template.

As you hold the flap barely open, the uphill chuckle to your lower-right becomes clearer: water running up a tin runnel, laughing softly as it climbs. The sound is *too* clean—like it’s been routed, guided, made to happen here.

Behind you, far up the spiral, your planted chime gives no further ticks, but the fog-pressure shifts again—subtle, patient, still listening for a report that hasn’t arrived.

Jun leans closer without touching the flap. “If you gum it,” they whisper, “do it messy. Make it look like fog-sap, not a hand. Guild hates admitting a person beat them.”

**Status updates:**  
- Listener confirmed: Guild service flap  
- Peeked inside: interest-tag found

### Turn 178 [PLAYER]

I whisper, “That tag—someone’s writing in my kind of ink,” and, without pulling it free, I angle my charm closer to read any tiny initials or stamp on the paper fiber. Then I dab a messy smear of clove-wax along the flap’s inner rim and the bruised-glass edge—uneven, like fog-sap—before easing the seam mostly shut again. 

To Jun: “If it gets hungry, we don’t feed it—follow the laughing water,” and I start sliding toward the uphill tin-runnel chuckle, keeping my steps broken and my hands off the seam.

*Agent reasoning: That interest-tag using my debt-ink language feels personal; I want to inspect it and sabotage the listener without making it obvious, then follow the “too clean” uphill water as a possible routed path/exit.*

### Turn 179 [GAME]

The charm’s brass catches a thin, listening glow and throws it sideways across the paper tag without you needing to tug it. Ink rises from the fibers the way bruises rise under skin: not brighter—*truer*. In the lower corner, half-hidden under the knot, you catch a stamp pressed so lightly it’s almost manners:

**H. BRINE** — and beneath it, a wick-glyph like a hooked eyelash. Tallyman Hush Brine’s mark. The tag isn’t yours, but it’s been *posed* in your dialect.

You smear clove-wax in an ugly, uneven crescent along the flap’s inner rim and kiss the bruised-glass edge with the same mess, making it look like fog-sap seeped in and panicked. The wax takes—clove bite in your nose, sticky heat on your fingertips—and the listener’s hum falters into a clogged, muffled flutter. For one breath, the whole throat-space feels less observed.

Then you ease the seam mostly shut.

Behind you, the fog-pressure reacts late, like a dog realizing the scent went quiet: it presses, then drifts, searching for the “missing” report. Somewhere up-spiral, a distant lantern gives a tiny ache-sound—metal complaining—not a footstep, but an attention-shift.

Jun exhales through their teeth. “Brine,” they whisper, and there’s real dislike there. “He counts debts like prayers. If his stamp’s on it, the Guild thinks you’re already *in their book*.”

You turn toward the uphill chuckle and start sliding down-and-right toward the tin runnel, keeping your steps broken and your hands off the walls. The water’s laughter is clearer now—thin stream climbing a bent strip of lantern-tin, rattling as it goes. The tin is riveted into the stone like a gutter installed by someone who wanted this sound to travel. As you near it, the chuckle shifts half a tone, almost as if it’s trying to match your breathing and failing on purpose.

Jun follows close, eyes up, one hand hovering near their own throat like they’re feeling for their pulse. “If it gets hungry,” they murmur back, “it’ll offer you a ‘safe route’ in a voice you recognize. Don’t answer it.”

The clove-waxed flap behind you stays shut—but the muffled hum inside begins to *work* against the clog, a patient grinding like an ear clearing itself.

**Status updates:**
- Listener flap: gummed, muffled
- Tag stamp read: H. Brine

### Turn 180 [PLAYER]

I crouch by the tin runnel and watch the water climb—eyes tracing the rivets and seams for any wick-scratch glyphs, recent tool marks, or a hidden grate where the sound is being “thrown.” Without looking back, I murmur to Jun, “Hush Brine—why does his name taste like trouble? Did you cross him, or did he cross you?” Then I dip two fingers into the uphill stream and flick a few droplets ahead onto the stone, seeing where they flow when they’re not “told” to laugh.

*Agent reasoning: The laughing uphill water feels engineered; I want to inspect the tin runnel for traps, symbols, or hidden passages, and I also want to learn what Jun knows about Hush Brine without stopping too long for the listener to recover.*

### Turn 181 [GAME]

You crouch at the tin runnel where it’s bolted into the stone—midway along the spiral ledge—and watch the water climb like it’s remembering a different gravity. Your eyes pick up the workmanship fast: the rivets are too regular for scavenged repair, and the seams have been **recently re-crimped**—bright metal bruised under a tool, then rubbed dull with soot to look old.

Near the third rivet from the bend, you find what you were looking for: a **wick-scratch glyph**—not a tally this time, but a tiny hooked loop, the same “eyelash” mark you saw under **H. BRINE**. Someone signed the *sound* as well as the paper.

You dip two fingers into the uphill stream. It’s cold enough to sting, and it vibrates faintly—like a throat humming behind a door. You flick droplets ahead onto the stone.

Immediate result: the droplets **do not follow** the runnel’s obedient laugh. They skitter, hesitate… then most of them **roll downhill** in the natural direction, silent and ordinary. Two beads, though, catch on an invisible “line” in the air and crawl **sideways** toward a hairline gap between stones—a hidden grate seam no wider than paper. The chuckle you’ve been tracking isn’t the water’s joy at all; it’s being **thrown** through that gap, vented like breath.

As you register that, the sound shifts—cleaner, closer—and for a moment it syncs with your chest. Your heartbeat answers it without permission, loud in your ears, like someone turned you into a drum.

Jun, behind and slightly upslope, goes very still. When you ask about Hush Brine, their reply comes tight and quick, as if they don’t want the fog to learn the shape of it. “He didn’t cross me. He *counted* me. Brine tallies favors before you know you owe them. If he stamps your ink-dialect on a debt-tag, he can say you agreed to the route—then the lamps get to call you ‘late.’”

The fog around the grate seam seems to thin, as if lips parting.

Your own pulse starts to **amplify**, drowning out small sounds—the chime, Jun’s breath, even the runnel’s rattle—leaving one laughing corridor of noise that tries to make “uphill” feel like the only true direction.

**Status updates:**  
- Runnel rigging confirmed: recent toolwork

### Turn 182 [PLAYER]

I clamp my palm hard over my moth-charm against my sternum and force a jagged breath—two short inhales, one long exhale—to break the beat, then whisper to Jun, “Don’t listen to it. Count backwards—wrong.” I slide my knife-tip (or a thin pick if I’ve got one) into that hairline grate seam and pry just enough to peek, keeping my movements messy and irregular; with my other hand I smear a bit of the clove-wax across the vent lip to damp the laugh without sealing it clean.

*Agent reasoning: The grate seam is the real source of the thrown chuckle and it’s starting to entrain my heartbeat; I want to break the sync, learn what’s behind the vent, and avoid giving the “ear” a clean rhythm.*

### Turn 183 [GAME]

Your palm clamps the moth-charm to your sternum hard enough to bite, and you saw your breath into a broken pattern—two short, one long. The laugh in the tin runnel **stutters**, losing its clean lock on your pulse. Your heartbeat is still loud, but it’s yours again: uneven, stubborn, off-tempo.

Jun flinches like they’ve been slapped awake. They avert their eyes from the runnel entirely and start counting under their breath—backwards, wrong on purpose. “Nine… seven… eight… six…” Their voice is thin but it *interrupts* the resonance, like grit in a gear.

You slide the tip of your map-knife into the hairline grate seam. Stone sweats cold against your knuckles. You pry just enough to make a slit—messy, irregular pressure—while your other hand smears clove-wax across the vent lip in a blotchy crescent. The wax doesn’t seal it; it **dampens** it. The laugh coming through turns hoarse, as if forced through teeth.

**Immediate outcome:** the vent gives you a peek.

Beyond the seam is a narrow cavity—an installed throat of tin and bark-paper, riveted into the stone. Someone has built a **sound-duct** that carries the uphill chuckle from somewhere deeper and *projects* it here. Wedged inside, you glimpse a little bundle: **bone-dust packed in wax** around a thin reed of cracked glass—more Choir craft than Guild, but set with Guild rivets. Cooperation, or theft.

As you hold the seam open, a faint, delayed chime-note arrives from upslope—your planted marker answering something you can’t see. Not footsteps; a careful repositioning. The fog behind you leans in, curious at the muffled laugh, testing whether the “ear” has gone quiet for good.

Jun whispers without looking at you, “Brine’s stamp and Choir bone in the same throat—this is a framed route. He’ll ‘prove’ you led people here, then bill you for the ones who vanish.”

The clove-wax begins to chill and set on the vent lip. Under it, the duct’s laugh keeps trying to recover its brightness, but it can’t find a clean edge to sing through.

**Status updates:**
- Heartbeat resonance: disrupted
- Sound-vent: pried, partially damped

### Turn 184 [PLAYER]

I whisper to Jun, “If Brine’s framing me, I want his handwriting—where does he keep his ledgers, and who in the Choir would lend bone to a Guild rivet?” Keeping my breath jagged, I scrape a pinhead of the bone-wax onto my knife tip for later, then use my chalk to mark a tiny moth sigil beside the grate seam. 

Then I ease the grate back down and slide us downslope into the fog-shadow, trying to circle wide and low to get eyes on whoever “repositioned” near my chime without walking straight back into the laugh.

*Agent reasoning: The duct is a clue and possibly a trap; I want to learn where it leads and what the bone-wax reed does, but we’re being repositioned on the slope. I’ll gather a small sample/mark it, then move before we’re boxed in, while questioning Jun about Brine and Choir ties.*

I whisper to Jun, “I want Brine’s handwriting—where does he keep his ledgers, and which Choir hands trade bone to Guild rivets?” I keep my breath jagged, scrape a pinhead of the bone-wax onto my knife tip, and chalk a tiny moth sigil beside the grate seam. Then I ease the grate back down and slide us downslope into the fog-shadow, circling wide and low to get eyes on whoever repositioned near my chime without stepping back into that laugh.

I slide us downslope into the fog-shadow, circling wide and low to get eyes on whoever repositioned near my chime without walking straight back into that laughing runnel.

I whisper to Jun, “I want Brine’s handwriting—where does he keep his ledgers, and which Choir hands trade bone to Guild rivets?” I keep my breathing jagged, scrape a pinhead of the bone-wax onto my knife tip for later, and chalk a tiny moth sigil beside the grate seam before easing it shut. Then I tug Jun downslope into the fog-shadow and circle wide and low, eyes on my chime’s last position, trying to catch whoever shifted up there without stepping back into that laughing runnel.

Then I tug Jun downslope into the fog-shadow and circle wide and low, eyes on my chime’s last position, trying to catch whoever shifted up there without stepping back into that laughing runnel.

*Agent reasoning: I want evidence tying Brine to the trap, plus a suspect for the Choir materials; I also don’t want to walk back into the laugh’s line, so I’ll circle and try to spot the mover while leaving a subtle mark and taking a sample.*

### Turn 193 [GAME]

Jun flinches at the name *Brine* like it’s a hot rivet. He lets you pull him downslope, staying close enough that his breath keeps time with yours.

“Ledgers?” he whispers back, voice scraped thin. “Brine doesn’t carry them. Too many hands. He keeps them in the Guild’s **Tally Niche**—under the listening lamps by the **kiln-shed switchback**, behind a false backboard. Smells like pitch and wet paper. You’ll know it because the lamp there bruises blue instead of amber.”

At your first question—Choir hands—Jun’s eyes flick uphill toward the fog like he expects it to answer. “Bone to rivets… there’s a *pair* that does it. They don’t sing. They tap. Folks call them **Hollow-Nails**. Trade through cullet-haulers. If you see glass reeds bundled in twine with *black thread*, that’s their mark. Brine pays in ‘interest’ vials.”

You scrape the pinhead of bone-wax onto your knife tip; it clings and dulls the metal’s shine, leaving a faint chalk-sweet stink. The moth sigil you chalk beside the grate seam goes on clean—then, a heartbeat later, the fog beads over it like sweat, trying to blur the lines. It doesn’t erase it, but it *wants* to.

You ease the grate shut. No squeal—good. But somewhere above, the Hollow gives a small, private chuckle, and the air answers with a tremor.

Circling wide and low through the fog-shadow, you get eyes back toward where your cloth-wrapped chime had been. The spot isn’t empty: a figure crouches there now, half-hidden by the stone-sweat sheen—bundled like a cullet-hauler, but too still. Their hand is on your chime bundle, not stealing it—*listening* to it, as if waiting for it to say your name a syllable late. A second presence shows itself only as a moving dent in fog further upslope, pacing the laughing runnel’s edge without stepping into it.

Jun’s fingers tighten on your sleeve. “That’s not Guild,” he mouths. “Guild stomps. That one… counts.”

### Turn 194 [PLAYER]

I pull Jun down another step into thicker shadow and whisper, “Hold—don’t breathe loud.” Then I pinch a grit-stone and *tick* it once against my knife’s spine, a tiny, deliberate chime-echo, watching the crouched listener for a flinch or a turn.

Keeping low, I murmur toward the bundled figure, “That chime’s mine. If you’re counting, tell me what number you’re waiting for—and who taught you to listen with your hand.”

*Agent reasoning: Two watchers—one listening to my chime, one pacing the runnel. I want information without triggering the laugh; use misdirection and my mapmaker’s habits. I’ll probe the listener with a soft sound-test and be ready to tag them with bone-wax if they rush us.*

### Turn 195 [GAME]

Jun sinks with you into thicker shadow—down by the stone-sweat’s north edge where the fog hangs heavier and tastes of burnt wick. He clamps his lips shut and nods, chest barely moving.

You pinch a grit-stone and *tick* it once against your knife’s spine.

**Immediate outcome:** the crouched listener *does* flinch—just not like a startled thief. Their shoulders tighten, and their hand on your cloth-wrapped chime goes perfectly still, fingers splayed as if feeling for a vibration through fabric. Their head turns toward you a fraction too late, like they’re letting the sound arrive twice.

The fog-dent pacer upslope pauses on the runnel’s lip. The Hollow’s chuckle thins into a held breath.

Your murmur reaches the bundled figure. They answer without looking straight at you, voice low and dry, like paper rubbed with ash.

“Yours,” they say, tasting the word. “Yes. It remembers your warmth.”

A beat. Their thumb presses the bundle—*listening with the joint*, not the ear.

“I’m waiting for **seven**,” they add. “The number right before the joke learns it’s a knife.”

When you ask who taught them, they finally lift their gaze. You catch the glint of something dark threaded through their sleeve seam—black fiber like rumor-card filament, not common twine.

“Brine didn’t,” they say. “Brine only *pays*.”

Their hand withdraws from your chime, slow and careful, as if letting go might ring it. “The **Hollow-Nails** taught me. Tap-bone to rivet-iron. Hear which way the lamp *leans*.”

Behind them, the fog-dent pacer resumes—one step, two—tracking the edge of the laughing runnel like a surveyor measuring a drop. Not coming down yet, but not leaving.

The bundled listener shifts their weight as if preparing to stand, and you see a cullet-hauler’s strap… but it’s empty. No glass. No load. Just the *shape* of someone who should be hauling.

**Status updates:**  
- Crouched listener: engaged, not fleeing

### Turn 196 [PLAYER]

I ease a palm up, slow, showing I’m not reaching for the chime yet. “Seven of what—taps, breaths, debts? And when it arrives, who gets cut: me, Brine, or the Hollow-Nails?”  

Then I tilt my chin toward the empty strap. “No glass, no load—so you’re here on purpose. Tell me where Hollow-Nails meet, and I’ll trade you a true thing: where Brine hides his ledgers.” I flick a glance upslope at the fog-dent pacer. “And your surveyor friend—are they counting too, or guarding the laugh?”

*Agent reasoning: “Seven” and the Hollow-Nails are a lead; I want names, routes, and what the fog-dent is doing. I also want my chime back without triggering the runnel, so I’ll bargain with information and keep my hands visible.*

### Turn 197 [GAME]

Your raised palm buys you a sliver of trust: the bundled listener doesn’t lunge for the chime again. Instead, they sink their fingers into their own sleeve seam and *tap once*—a tiny self-check—then answer.

“Seven **taps**,” they say. “Not breaths. Breaths lie when you’re afraid.” Their eyes flick to Jun in the shadow, then back to you. “Seven taps on a listening thing, and the lamp decides it’s hungry.”

When you ask who gets cut, their mouth twitches like they’re suppressing a smile they don’t want to pay for. “Whoever *answers* the hunger first. Sometimes it’s the mapmaker. Sometimes it’s the man with the ledger. Sometimes it’s the ones who think nails don’t bleed.”

Your mention of the empty strap lands. The listener shifts, letting you see the strap’s buckle: a rivet capped with a dull white bead—bone-wax, old and thumb-worn. Purpose, yes. Choir-adjacent craft, but not Choir-song.

“Trade,” they repeat, weighing the word. “A true thing for a true place.” They glance toward the fog like they’re checking whether the trees are listening.

“Hollow-Nails meet where glass learns to sing,” they say at last, voice lower. “Under the **uphill brook**—not at the water, beneath it—where the reeds are glass and the stones are warm. There’s a cullet-drop with black thread tied in a bow. Touch the bow, don’t untie it. If you untie it, you’ll be *invited*.”

At “Brine’s ledgers,” they tilt their head, interested despite themself. “Say it, then. Not loud. The Court likes loud truths.”

Upslope, the fog-dent pacer stops pacing and goes still—too still. The lanternlight up there brightens as if pleased, and the fog sweetens with that burnt-wick sugar. A faint, answering *almost-laugh* rises in your throat unasked, and the chimes in the air shift half a beat late, tugging at your pulse like a hand trying to guide a dance.

The bundled listener notices the change and stiffens. “Your laugh is *showing*,” they hiss. “That one”—a nod toward the dent—“isn’t counting. They’re **guarding the laugh-bottle route**. If they hear you pay, they’ll walk you to a punchline you won’t like.”

Jun’s fingers press your wrist—hard—begging you to stay quiet without making a sound.

### Turn 198 [PLAYER]

I swallow the almost-laugh hard, press two fingers to my moth charm like a stitch in my throat, and whisper to Jun, “If I start smiling, pinch me—hard.”  

To the bundled listener, I keep my voice flat and small: “True thing, then—Brine’s ledgers sit in the Guild’s Tally Niche, under the listening lamps by the kiln-shed switchback, behind a false backboard. Lamp bruises blue.”  

Without breaking eye-line, I slide my other hand inch by inch to hook the chime bundle’s cord and draw it back toward my shadow. “And if I touch the black bow under the brook—how do I tell Hollow-Nails from the Court before the lamp gets hungry?”

*Agent reasoning: I want the meeting place, but the pacer is listening for “payment” and the Hollow is tugging at my laugh; I should trade quietly and indirectly, and secure my chime while keeping the listener talking.*

### Turn 200 [PLAYER]

I press two fingers to my moth charm and whisper to Jun, “If I start smiling, pinch—don’t warn.”  

Keeping low, I slowly reel the chime bundle’s cord into my shadow and murmur toward the bundled listener, “Brine’s ledgers: Tally Niche, listening lamps by the kiln-shed switchback—false backboard, bruised-blue lamp.” I glance upslope at the fog-dent and ask, “Now—how do I tell Hollow-Nails from the Court under the brook, before anyone decides to get hungry?”

*Agent reasoning: The scene went eerily blank—either the fog’s doing or the interface glitch. I’ll steady Jun, retrieve my chime, and try to re-engage the bundled listener with a careful question while watching the upslope pacer.*

### Turn 201 [GAME]

Jun’s answer is immediate: two fingers clamp the soft meat of your forearm—hard enough to sting, not hard enough to leave a mark. It’s a pre-emptive pinch, a promise kept early. The almost-laugh in your throat buckles and goes down like a swallowed thorn.

In the thicker shadow just off the laughing runnel, you reel the cloth-wrapped chime by its cord. It slides across stone-sweat with a faint, reluctant *shhhk*—and the air around it tightens as if the Hollow had been holding that cord too. The bundled listener watches your hand, but doesn’t stop you; they watch upslope more.

When you murmur Brine’s ledger-location, the bundled listener’s eyes widen a fraction—then flatten into something careful. “Bruised-blue,” they repeat under their breath, as if tasting a color. “So that’s where he keeps his ribs.” They tuck that truth away like a blade.

Upslope, the fog-dent pacer shifts their stance toward you. The listening lanternlight there bruises the air amber, and for a heartbeat it feels like your words have weight—enough weight to roll downhill.

The bundled listener answers your question fast, like they’re trying to get it said before the light can learn it.

“Under the brook: **Hollow-Nails don’t read you. They listen for the wrong beat.** Court-scribes read. They’ll make you repeat yourself.” A small jerk of their chin toward your chest. “If someone under there asks you to *say the route aloud*, that’s Court work. If they ask you to *tap it*—knuckle to stone, seven short—Hollow-Nails.”

They lean closer, voice almost inaudible. “Hollow-Nails carry **black thread** and keep their hands dirty with cullet dust. Court keeps their hands clean and their words sharp. Court will offer ‘authentication.’ Hollow-Nails will offer ‘quiet.’”

A pause—then a warning with teeth. “And if the lamp gets hungry, don’t feed it laughter. Feed it **a lie that costs you**. Lamps like expensive lies. It keeps them chewing longer.”

The chime bundle is now fully in your shadow, cord looped around your fingers; it feels warmer than it should, like it’s been held recently.

### Turn 202 [PLAYER]

I give the bundled listener a slow nod. “If we meet again, you get a better true thing—your name, for mine.”  

To Jun, I whisper, “Back toward the kiln-shed switchback—quiet feet, no words.” Then I palm the chime bundle close to my ribs and start drifting downslope through the fog-shadow, angling away from the runnel and the pacer’s line of sight.

*Agent reasoning: The fog-dent pacer is keyed in on us; I want to learn who the bundled listener is and why they handled my chime, but we need to move before the Court overhears. I’ll set a future rendezvous, then slip away toward the kiln-shed switchback to verify the Tally Niche while the lead is fresh.*

### Turn 203 [GAME]

Jun nods once—tight, almost invisible—and answers your whisper by making himself smaller in the fog, stepping where your boot-prints already ghost the stone-sweat. No words. Good.

The bundled listener accepts your offer with a tilt of the head that’s almost formal. “Names are knives,” they breathe. “Bring yours sharp.” They don’t follow—yet—but you feel their attention stay on your back like a hand hovering near a pocket.

You drift downslope, angling away from the laughing runnel. The fog here is thicker and colder; it tastes less like sugar-rot and more like damp paper. To your left, the runnel’s giggle thins into a wet chuckle, and the chimes in the air retune to your heartbeat again—half a beat late, still trying to make you dance.

The cloth-wrapped chime bundle pressed to your ribs warms further, as if it recognizes motion. Through the cloth, something inside gives a tiny, sympathetic *tick*—not a ring, but a near-ring, like it’s swallowing its own sound.

Behind you, upslope, the fog-dent pacer shifts to keep you in line-of-scent—then stops. Not because they lost you, but because they’ve found something else: the lanternlight bruises brighter once, and you hear a soft glassy scrape, like someone setting down a bottle carefully. A second presence joins them—footfalls too neat for the runnel stones. Court-neat.

Jun’s fingers brush your sleeve seam—warning by touch only—then point low: a darker crease in the fog-shadow that cuts toward the kiln-shed switchback route you know. It’s safer terrain, but it runs close to where Guild lamps “listen” hardest.

As you slide into that crease, the bundled listener’s voice carries once, barely. “Don’t let the lamp hear you *thinking* about the niche.”

The Hollow answers with silence that feels amused.

### Turn 204 [PLAYER]

I press my tongue to my teeth and force my mind blank—counting my steps instead of thinking “niche”—and signal Jun with two taps on my own thigh to keep close. While we move through the fog-crease, I shift the cloth bundle inside my coat and wrap it tighter with my scarf to muffle any tick, then whisper to it under my breath, “Hush—later,” and listen for any answering vibration.

Without looking back, I angle my ear upslope for those Court-neat footfalls and murmur to Jun, “If you hear a bottle scrape again, point—don’t speak.”

*Agent reasoning: The lamps can “hear” thoughts and the chime is warming—risking a tell. I want to keep moving, but I’m too curious not to learn what the chime is doing, so I’ll test it quietly while masking my mind and watching for the Court presence.*

### Turn 205 [GAME]

Counting steps works. The fog-crease stops feeling like it’s “agreeing” with you and starts feeling like plain terrain again—slick stone, damp bark, your own breath. Jun stays close on your two-tap signal, placing his boots where your heel already kissed the moss so your passage is one smeared set of prints instead of two.

You tuck the cloth-wrapped chime bundle deeper inside your coat and cinch it with your scarf. The near-ring becomes a muffled *thum* against your ribs. When you whisper, “Hush—later,” it answers: not a sound, but a faint vibration through the cloth, like a swallowed note trying to find the shape of your words. It settles after two heartbeats, obedient… or listening.

Downslope, the fog tastes of wet paper and old wick. To your right (east), the laughing runnel is now just a thin, teasing burble; to your left (west), the stones rise into a low bank where cartouches on bark shift when you don’t look straight at them.

Upslope, you angle your ear. The Court-neat footfalls are there—measured, careful not to slip—paired with a softer step that doesn’t care if it scuffs. Then: the bottle scrape again, very light, like glass kissed by a fingernail.

Jun freezes mid-step and points without speaking: upslope-left, where the fog bruises amber around a cracked lantern-post that leans at knee height. The post looks ordinary—soot, old wire, a split collar of iron—until the lanternlight *listens harder* and the soot begins to unspool.

Bright thread spills out of the post’s throat in a sudden, eager bloom—stitch-fine and luminous—snaking low across the stone toward the crease you’re using, hunting ankles by feel rather than sight. It moves like it already knows the shape of a leg.

From upslope, a voice you can’t quite place—polite, tired—says to someone unseen, “Careful. The warden-skein’s awake. Hands visible.”

The thread twitches, tasting the air for motion.

### Turn 206 [PLAYER]

I freeze with Jun, lifting my heels so my soles barely kiss stone, and slowly step up onto the low bank to keep my ankles off the thread’s level. I pinch a pebble from the bark-cartouched edge and, with a careful underhand flick, toss it downslope-right toward the runnel to draw the skein away. Under my breath to Jun only: “No running—watch the hands.”

*Agent reasoning: The skein hunts ankles; moving risks getting stitched. I’ll freeze, go higher ground, and use a cheap distraction—dust/pebble—while keeping silent and watching the Court pair for clues.*

### Turn 207 [GAME]

Your careful heel-lift and step up onto the low bank works: the thread-skein skims the stone at ankle-height and misses you by a handspan, sliding under the lip where your boots no longer are. Jun mirrors you, shoulders tight, hands visible at chest level like he’s been trained to look harmless.

The pebble you pinch from the cartouched edge is cold and slightly tacky with sap. When you underhand it downslope-right, it clicks twice on stone and then *plunks* into the laughing runnel.

Immediate reaction: the skein whips its bright stitches toward the sound like a startled cat—fast, low, hungry. It pours across the crease and into the runnel’s shallow edge, stitching at the water’s surface as if trying to hem the giggle shut. The runnel answers with a louder chuckle and the thread shivers, confused by moving water.

To the west (upslope-left), the cracked lantern-post leans harder, listening. The amber bruise-light around it pulses once, then steadies—like it’s pleased you gave it something simple to chase.

The Court-neat presence steps closer into partial view through fog: not a face, but a sleeve and a gloved hand held open, palm out in a “peace” shape. A thin strip of pale bark-paper hangs from their other hand like a warrant that isn’t being read aloud. Their voice stays polite and tired. “Good. Still hands. Keep them where the lantern can see. The skein only bites what it thinks is fleeing.”

Beside that voice, the softer-step companion shifts—Guild weight, Guild posture. You catch another tiny glass scrape, closer now, as if a bottle is being set down on stone with reverence.

On your bank, the cartouches in the bark at your fingertips re-ink around your shadow, tightening into little knot-shapes. The tree feels like it’s taking notes on how you moved without saying it.

### Turn 208 [PLAYER]

I keep both hands up and open, fingers spread, and angle my body so my coat stays between their sightline and my ribs. “Easy—hands where your lantern likes them.”  

I tilt my head toward the gloved hand and the bark-paper. “Court, then? Who’s holding the warrant, and who’s setting down bottles like offerings?”  

Without looking away from them, I let my fingertips lightly brush the re-inking cartouches beside my thigh, tracing one knot-shape to see if it forms a direction-mark—then I murmur to Jun, barely breath: “If the skein turns back, drop another pebble—farther right.”

*Agent reasoning: The Court and Guild are closing in; I need to keep the skein distracted while I learn who they are and what they want, without revealing the niche or the bundle. I’ll comply with “hands visible,” ask careful questions, and probe the bark-cartouches for clues while looking for an exit line along the bank.*
