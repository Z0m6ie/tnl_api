A gust of warmer air rolls out—sweet, chemical-sick—and it carries a faint, wet clicking like teeth tapping together in the dark.\n\nYou snap back to the airlock gap and fire a burst through the narrowing slit.\n\nImmediate outcome: you hit *something*—not a clean metallic ping, not a suit-plating ring. It answers with a dull, meaty impact and a short, involuntary exhale that fogs the edge of the gap. The pressure on the door drops for half a second… then returns, lower and steadier, as if whatever’s out there changed grip rather than retreated.\n\nThrough the gap, your light catches a smear of skin-tone—fingers—pressed flat, knuckles bending the wrong way. No glove. No tool. Just hand.\n\nThe Helix operator comes back on, voice tightened now: “You just discharged in a controlled salvage lane. That’s breach-of-contract and grounds for containment. Kade—there are no authorized personnel on that hull. Whatever you’re engaging is not ours.” A beat. Then, quieter: “Your old unit’s callsigns are in the quarantine packet. Did you bring the wafer aboard?”\n\nDown the corridor, the doubled ping resolves into two sources: one ahead and one *above you*, vibrating through the ductwork you just opened.

The sweet chemical stink surges out harder, and with it comes a thin, choked vocalization from inside the duct line, cut off mid-breath.\n\nYou backpedal down the main corridor, boots sticking then releasing with tacky snaps. The amber strips strobe overhead; each pulse makes the handprints on the bulkhead look freshly glossed.\n\nYou slap tape around the pry bar and the door track—fast, ugly, functional. The inner airlock door shudders as pressure tests it again, but the bar holds; the tape bites into cold metal and starts to peel at the edges from the strain.\n\nUp in the duct seam above you, the doubled ping accelerates—three short, one long—then *breaks rhythm* as if whatever’s making it is startled.

Its head jerks toward the ping source like it’s listening to a conductor only it can hear.\n\nYou hose it center-mass. The rounds walk through sternum and shoulder; it spasms, but it doesn’t fall like a body. It *repositions*, dragging itself sideways into the duct run with a wet, efficient strength—leaving strips of skin on the torn edge. A dark fluid strings after it and snaps.\n\nThe frag goes off in the maintenance line behind you—more concussion than shrapnel in that confined trunk.

If the ship’s field hiccups, the anchor grabs *you* before it lets the structure shear. It’s supposed to keep crews alive. It also keeps them… *in place.* Don’t fire into the lighting bus—those ‘repeaters’ are tied into the auxiliary mass grid.”\n\nBehind your knee, the deck film has climbed to your boot like tar with intent. You jam the pry bar under the edge and lever. It peels with a wet tearing sound, stretching into translucent strands that snap back at your glove. Your knife saws through the last tack; a sting of heat runs up your ankle as the film tries to re-bond, then you rip free. The adhesive leaves a dark, handprint-like residue on the sole.\n\nYou shoulder the rifle and push forward, ribs of bulkhead giving you staggered cover. The torn duct overhead coughs a thin drip—dark fluid pattering on the deck. The retreating scrape is ahead now, deeper toward the spine, fast and *quiet* except when it hits a junction and the whole run rings like a tuning fork.\n\nAs you pass the smeared handprints on the wall, your light catches something underneath the grime: a partially burned **Helix microstamp** and a short numeric string, heat-warped but legible in places—after-report chain formatting, the kind that follows boarding actions that “never happened.” Someone tried to scrub it with flame and only bruised it into permanence.\n\nThe airlock behind you slams once against your taped pry bar—hard enough to make the tape shriek. Above, the duct scrape pauses, then answers with the same three-short-one-long ping you heard earlier… but it’s off by a fraction now, like it’s learning to fake timing.\n\nHelix tightbeam drops to a lower, almost reluctant tone: “Kade—if you’re going to the recorder route, it’s through the spine access.

Up close, your beam catches a hairline seam and a microstamp—Helix’s triangle nested inside a serial string. There’s a **flush service latch** disguised as a scuff-guard strip. When you press your thumb along it, it gives a tiny mechanical *click* like a spring detent… but it doesn’t open on pressure alone. No obvious port face—Helix made it “tool-only.”\n\nYour light rakes the ceramic and finds **two pinholes** at the lower edge—optic and mic-sized—angled to watch the passage. They’re dark right now, but the glass has fresh wipe marks, like someone cleaned them recently.\n\nHelix tightbeam comes back fast. “That’s an **audit tap panel**. Hidden access, yes. Power tap, yes—low draw. It’ll open with a keyed shim or a flat pry if you don’t care about leaving evidence.” A pause that’s almost a wince. “Inside should be a ceramic fuse block and a fiber coupler. If you bridge it, you can steal a trickle and you can also *see* if Helix has an active node deeper in—if it’s live, your presence is already logged.”\n\nAs you keep moving, the passage bends toward port. Your light cuts the corner and finds the **port access notch**: a squared recess with a secondary ladder drop—painted safety stripes half-flaked away—and a bundled **double-run fiber** lashed with white clips, exactly like Helix said.\n\nBehind you, through the bulkhead, the baffle door gives a soft, sustained **scrape**—not a bang. Something dragging itself along the other side, feeling for gaps. The arcing in the trunk has quieted to intermittent pops, farther apart now, like the fault is dying down.\n\nDown the ladder notch, cool air rises in a steady draft that smells cleaner—closer to “maintained” than “derelict.”\n\n**Status updates**\n- Helix ceramic: audit tap panel found  \n- Watch pinholes: present, recently wiped  \n- Port access notch: reached  \n- Trunk arcing: fading, intermittent  \n- Contact at baffle: scraping, probing",

The draft here is colder and cleaner; your light catches the double-run fiber bundle descending with you, white clips flashing like teeth in the dark.

It’s using the ship’s fiber trunks like nerves. Your beacon just gave it a taste.”\n\nAs you continue down, your light catches something else: a **cable tie** on the fiber bundle has been freshly replaced—white clip too clean, edges sharp.

The bundle snaps back hard, retreating with a scraping, furious skitter.\n\nBut your burst has a cost: the crawl’s rim is lined with conduit and old service runs.

If it woke, someone’s listening.”\n\nYou don’t wait. You jam your knife into the override bay and bridge the two pins.\n\nThe panel **accepts** it—an old-school service bypass. The SPINE-2 pressure door shudders, seals vent a short cough of stale air, and the lock dogs begin to retract with a deep, reluctant clunk.\n\nAt the same instant, the starboard crawl answers: the tar knot at the lip **unfurls** a finger-thin filament that reaches toward the ladder base, tasting the air where Juno was dragged. It pauses at the edge of your light, then withdraws—slow, deliberate—like it’s learned the boundary you’ve drawn.\n\nOver comms, the Helix tightbeam hisses back in, clearer now, riding the turret’s wake-up ping: “—contact confirmed. Kade on SPINE-2. Containment authorization—” The rest is swallowed by a second voice sliding under it, calm as a lullaby: “Latch the choir.”\n\n**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re crouched tight to the SPINE-2 door’s low-left frame, knife bridging the pins inches from your glove; behind you, Juno is prone at the ladder cage in shin-high fog; overhead, the crippled turret twitches and whines.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES**\n- Turret: crippled, twitching\n- SPINE-2 door: unlocking, cycling\n- Helix tightbeam: you’re tagged\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

She yanks the cradle’s service skirt wider and exposes a recessed slot assembly—SPINE-2’s own buffer interface. “This bay *is* the reader, if the cradle board’s still got power. The maintenance trunk doesn’t have anything that can handshake a raw buffer without a Helix kit.”\n\n**Sensory grounding:** You’re braced between the dogged hatch (aft, vibrating under impact) and the recorder cradle (forward bulkhead), rifle up; the bay smells of hot dust and scorched insulation.\n\nJuno jabs a finger at the flickering audit console. “That console’s just an audit tap and uplink interface. It can *display* if it’s alive, but it won’t authenticate the cartridge by itself.” She grabs the Helix tightbeam module you ripped free earlier, turns it in her hands, and swears. “And someone already ripped the coupler out of this port—same scoring. They didn’t just steal hardware; they stole the *path*.”\n\nShe slams her palm against the console housing, then peels back a panel with a thumbnail. A tiny standby LED inside the console glows weakly—enough juice for a boot pulse, not enough for a clean read. “I can hot it—briefly—by backfeeding from the cradle’s service power. But if we do, anything listening on SPINE-2 will see a wake event. Helix loves wake events.”\n\nAnother impact hits the hatch—harder. The dogs hold, but the wheel shivers in its socket. From the seam you hear a thin, high scrape like metal being worried with something harder than fingernail.\n\nJuno looks up at you, voice low and urgent. “If you want *now*, we slot the cartridge into the cradle interface and I pull only what we need—timestamps, audit ID, last-write signature. Full dump takes longer and makes more noise on the bus.”\n\n**STATUS UPDATES**\n- Raw buffer: secured on you  \n- Hatch: holding, impacts escalating  \n- Read capability: cradle interface viable  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}",

At the next brace, she points down and makes a tight fist—*more nodes*—then slices two fingers across her palm: *cut them*.\n\nFrom above, the “wellness” voice is gone. In its place: a new sound—soft, rhythmic taps traveling through the hull plates, not random settling. A code. Someone is relaying your position the old way, through metal, because you just killed their clean line.\n\nDown the chase, past Juno’s shoulders, you can see the next junction: another red microstamp on a box cover, but this one has a faint amber sheen around the seam—fresh sealant foam, Helix-grade. Someone has been here recently, and they expected tampering.\n\n**Status updates**\n- Boot/knife: gel wiped off  \n- Helix tap fiber: severed, coupler torn free  \n- Bay contact: still cautious, deadman intact  \n- Hull taps: active tracking signal  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"Helix tap coupler (torn, damaged)\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

They’ll know which node went dark.” Then, quieter, almost embarrassed by the fear: “And thermite in a chase—Rhea, you’re going to cook the line insulation.”\n\nUp-chase, the careful scrape in the recorder bay stops being careful.

In its place: a single soft knock, deliberate, like someone tapping to be let in.\n\nJuno keeps moving but talks as she crawls, voice shaking: “If the buffer bladder starts to inflate, it’ll squeeze this run. Helix designs it to force evac routes one-way during fires. Someone can trigger it from a service bay—if they’ve got access.”\n\nAhead, the collar’s far end shows a **manual dog cover** and a faded stencil: *SPINE-2 / RECORDER SERVICE — PRESSURE DOOR CORRIDOR*—but the stencil has been overpainted once, then scratched back open with something sharp. Fresh.\n\n**Status updates**\n- Route: buffer collar confirmed\n- Cycling: initiated (low thrum)\n- Pursuer: toolwork ceased; knocking begins",

The rounds chew a ragged line into plating—sparks, flaked insulation, a brief spray of frost.\n\nThen something *moves* in the seam: not a body—more like a **thin filament bundle** snapping back from impact. It retracts fast, and the ticking stutters, skipping a beat like a metronome slapped off tempo.\n\nThe collar answers with a sudden **pressure-shift groan**.

Not a sentence you can parse. More like an imitation.\n\nJuno flinches hard at it. You grab her harness and shove; she stumbles forward, catches herself on a smeared handprint, and forces her boots to move again. “Panel—yeah—” she says, voice thin. “There should be a local pressure interlock. Helix likes redundant control in recorder corridors for audit teams.”\n\nYou back them toward the next access, rifle tracking the rear seam.

The tapping you’d heard earlier doesn’t return at the door—instead it shifts to a slower, more distant cadence that travels along the bulkhead like someone drumming on ribs, testing where you went.\n\nJuno’s voice comes through her respirator, thin and controlled: “I hear it—*not* at the door. It’s tracking the structure. Rhea… it’s learning the chase routes.”\n\nA second thread cuts in: your tightbeam module, buried in your kit, gives a tiny, involuntary **click**—not a full power-up, more like a capacitive twitch. No signal lights, but it’s the first “life” it’s shown since you ripped it free, like something nearby just changed the noise floor.\n\nUp ahead, your headlamp catches a junction where the chase splits around a boxy unit stamped with faded Helix microtext. One of the conduit bundles is freshly disturbed—zip ties cut and re-tied recently, edges still bright against the grime. Someone has been in here since the ship went dark.\n\nJuno hisses, urgent: “If you’re sealing behind us, do it *now*—I can’t hold the foam can and crawl at the same time.”\n\n**STATUS UPDATES**\n- Location: Service chase (forward)\n- Recorder bay: line-of-sight lost\n- Tapping: shifted, structural tracking\n- Chase: signs of recent access\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"Forward maintenance panel (fully removed)\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

Not gone—but disrupted, like you broke a jaw joint. Something inside answers with a wet, furious scrabble deeper in the door body, retreating from the line of fire.\n\nYou slam the pry bar into the manual dog socket on your side. It *is* there—half-obscured by the frame lip—and it takes the bar with a gritty, reluctant bite. You wrench.\n\nThe socket moves a fraction… then binds hard, as if the dog is being held from the inside by tensioned cable or something braced against it. Your arms shake. The bar creaks. The metal around the socket warms under your glove.\n\nBehind you, the vent throat shudders against the knife wedge—one slow pull this time, testing. The duct wall stays puckered tight around the blade, sealing, but the hilt vibrates like a tuning fork.\n\nJuno’s voice cuts in, tight: “You’re turning it—keep going. Whatever’s inside is *pulling back*. That means it’s not a welded jam; it’s a live hold.”\n\nYou count. “Three, two, one—PUSH!”\n\nYou throw your weight and torque together. The dog finally gives with a brutal *CLACK*—not a full release, but one dog off its seat. The seam jumps wider by a handspan and a breath of colder air rolls out, carrying that sweet-ozone stink and a faint copper note.\n\nIn the widened gap, you catch a glimpse: not a person—an articulated mass tight to the latch assembly, pale and slick, withdrawing fast into the dark as Juno’s next burst rips sparks and wet spray off the frame.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES**\n- Latch dog: partially disengaged  \n- Door seam: widened, unstable  \n- Vent duct: knife wedged, tugging continues  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

Something inside snaps forward just out of sight and rakes the edge; you feel the scrape through your glove but it doesn’t get purchase. You slap tape/sealant over the throat fast—hands moving on muscle memory—and the tape bows inward once, twice, then holds. The duct keeps *tapping* behind it, muffled now.\n\nYou’re still on the latch-side of the **SPINE-2 / Recorder Service pressure door corridor**, shoulder to frame, amber strips strobing sick across the wet seam. The gap is still a handspan, breathing cold air into your faceplate in short gusts.\n\nJuno keeps her promise. She leans into her angle and “stitches” the latch channel, rounds chewing the inner frame. “I’m on it—keep your hands clear of the bite,” she says, then adds, grim: “It’s learning the rhythm. It’s timing the flex between bursts.”\n\nYou plant the pry bar into the manual socket for the second dog and wrench. It moves—gritty, resisting—then the socket *kicks back* like something inside just threw weight against it. Your wrist jolts.\n\nYou kick the door edge and shove the rifle through the gap, firing into the dark. The muzzle flash strobes the interior: a narrow service vestibule beyond, slick with condensation, and a pale, jointed shape retreating up the latch-side wall—too fast, too many hinges. Your burst catches something; there’s a wet slap and a spatter across the inner bulkhead. The thing answers by yanking the door inward again—trying to clamp on your rifle.\n\nJuno barks, “Rhea—barrel!” and fires *past* your muzzle into the latch channel. Her rounds strike something hard; you hear a metallic shriek like a cable snapping under load.\n\nThe second dog suddenly turns freer—whatever was bracing it from inside just lost leverage. The pry bar swings another quarter turn with a heavy *CLACK*. The seam jumps wider, and a gust of colder, cleaner air spills out—followed by a thin, sweet stink that makes the back of your throat itch.\n\nSomewhere deeper inside, a low, patterned thrum starts up—like a voice testing a note through the hull.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES**\n- Vent throat: taped, holding  \n- Second dog: partially disengaged  \n- Door gap: widening, unstable  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

You run your thumb along the seam of your helmet like you can feel lies through it. Contract work stays simple. Secure the corridor. Keep the salvage crew alive. Get paid. You keep your temper on a short leash and you keep your eyes moving.\n\nThe first step sticks. The deck pulls at your boot like tack. Emergency strips pulse amber over smeared handprints. The smear shines wet. It should not. Helix Meridian—the corporate licensing cartel—tagged this wreck as cold and clean.\n\nYour comms hiss. You hear a heavy thud. Then another. Not metal cooling. Not drifting junk. It lands with intent. Your shoulders go tight before you can stop them.\n\nYour scanner pings the corridor ahead. It catches a return that repeats in a pattern. Three short. One long. Like someone testing a mic. The sound crawls under your skin because you know that beat. Your old unit used it to signal a latch breach.\n\nYou force a breath. You push forward. The corridor sweats recycled air. Something sweet rides under the filters.\n\nYour suit light hits a bulkhead. Someone scratched words into the paint with a tool. Fresh.

Then a voice—female, clipped, corporate calm—cuts in on a tightbeam you didn’t authorize: “Kade, step away from Helix property. That lock cycle was a safety interlock. You’re exhibiting escalation markers.”\n\nNot your crew.\n\nYour suit HUD flags the transmission as external relay, not ship-internal. Someone is listening from outside the hull—or through a repeater already on board.\n\nYou bring the rifle up and advance down the corridor. To your right, a maintenance hatch sits slightly proud of the wall, screws missing like they were backed out fast. A thin thread of sweet air leaks from its seam. Ahead, the amber strips pulse and your scanner repeats the pattern: three short, one long—now closer, and *offset* by a second echo, like a call-and-response.\n\nBehind you, the jammed door *thunks* again as the motor retries, then stops. Something else takes over: a softer pressure, steady, pushing the door inward—like a hand on the other side testing your wedge.\n\nFrom deeper in the ship, you hear the heavy impact again—one… two… then a scrape, as if something with weight is dragging itself along the deck plating, keeping low to avoid line of sight.\n\nThe Helix voice returns, quieter, almost coaxing: “Your contract doesn’t include independent entry. Confirm you have no additional personnel with you. Confirm you are not in possession of unlicensed data media.”\n\nYour corridor light catches those wet handprints again—this time you see the directionality: fingers splayed *outward*, as if someone pressed from inside the wall.\n\n**Status updates:**  \n- Inner door: Jammed, resisting pressure  \n- Helix tightbeam: Active, monitoring  \n- Ping pattern: Closing, doubled  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"pry bar\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Sable Accord - Airlock throat corridor\"],\"npcs_add\":[{\"name\":\"Helix Tightbeam Operator (unknown ID)\",\"role\":\"Remote Helix monitor/handler\",\"notes\":\"Claims lock cycle was a safety interlock; attempting containment/de-escalation; asking about data media and personnel.\"}]}\n```"

A gust of warmer air rolls out—sweet, chemical-sick—and it carries a faint, wet clicking like teeth tapping together in the dark.\n\nYou snap back to the airlock gap and fire a burst through the narrowing slit.\n\nImmediate outcome: you hit *something*—not a clean metallic ping, not a suit-plating ring. It answers with a dull, meaty impact and a short, involuntary exhale that fogs the edge of the gap. The pressure on the door drops for half a second… then returns, lower and steadier, as if whatever’s out there changed grip rather than retreated.\n\nThrough the gap, your light catches a smear of skin-tone—fingers—pressed flat, knuckles bending the wrong way. No glove. No tool. Just hand.\n\nThe Helix operator comes back on, voice tightened now: “You just discharged in a controlled salvage lane. That’s breach-of-contract and grounds for containment. Kade—there are no authorized personnel on that hull. Whatever you’re engaging is not ours.” A beat. Then, quieter: “Your old unit’s callsigns are in the quarantine packet. Did you bring the wafer aboard?”\n\nDown the corridor, the doubled ping resolves into two sources: one ahead and one *above you*, vibrating through the ductwork you just opened. Three short, one long—answered a half-second later, like something learning to mimic you. The heavy dragging scrape shifts closer, but it’s not on the main deckline anymore; it’s traveling through the walls, keeping pace.\n\nAmber strips strobe. In that stutter, the wet handprints on the bulkhead look like they’re multiplying—overlapping, as if several sets pressed through at different depths.\n\n**Status updates:**  \n- Maintenance hatch: Blown open, venting sweet air  \n- Airlock gap: Still jammed; pressure persists  \n- Pings: Two sources; one in ducts  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Sable Accord - Main corridor (adjacent to maintenance hatch)\"],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```"

The sweet chemical stink surges out harder, and with it comes a thin, choked vocalization from inside the duct line, cut off mid-breath.\n\nYou backpedal down the main corridor, boots sticking then releasing with tacky snaps. The amber strips strobe overhead; each pulse makes the handprints on the bulkhead look freshly glossed.\n\nYou slap tape around the pry bar and the door track—fast, ugly, functional. The inner airlock door shudders as pressure tests it again, but the bar holds; the tape bites into cold metal and starts to peel at the edges from the strain.\n\nUp in the duct seam above you, the doubled ping accelerates—three short, one long—then *breaks rhythm* as if whatever’s making it is startled. Something scrapes metal-on-metal in the ventilation run, moving away from the hatch you just fed the grenade… and toward the grate above your rifle.\n\nHelix tightbeam snaps back in, no longer coaxing: “We’re recording. Containment authorization is live. If you detonate ordnance in that hull, you will compromise the recorder and—” A second voice bleeds in under hers for half a second, distorted and devotional: “—don’t waste the opening—” then it’s gone, swallowed by static like it never existed.\n\nThe frag’s fuse hisses somewhere inside the ductwork—too loud in the staged silence—followed by a pressure change you feel in your teeth.\n\nA pale mist begins to breathe out of the maintenance hatch behind you and crawl along the deckline, sugar-sweet and ozonic. Your visor/HUD starts painting brief, false motion ticks at the edge of your sight—flickers that don’t match your rifle’s light sweep.\n\nThen the duct above you bows downward a fraction, screws whining.

The draft here is colder and cleaner; your light catches the double-run fiber bundle descending with you, white clips flashing like teeth in the dark. Half a deck down, you pass another Helix microstamp plate—this one has a faint **greasy handprint** across it, recent.\n\nHelix comes back in your ear, lower now. “Recorder corridor is still two decks down.

In the tight collar the shots are deafening; muzzle flash turns the condensation into a white storm. The rounds chew a ragged line into plating—sparks, flaked insulation, a brief spray of frost.\n\nThen something *moves* in the seam: not a body—more like a **thin filament bundle** snapping back from impact. It retracts fast, and the ticking stutters, skipping a beat like a metronome slapped off tempo.\n\nThe collar answers with a sudden **pressure-shift groan**. Not full compression, but enough that your suit fabric tightens on your shoulders and the air feels “thicker.” The cycling hasn’t stopped; it’s adapting.\n\nYou push through after Juno into the **SPINE-2 / Recorder Service pressure-door corridor**—a narrow passage with amber strips and a smeared wall of handprints that look fresh under your light. Behind you, at the collar end, the dogged mechanism holds… for now.\n\nFrom back the way you came: the soft knocking stops. A new sound replaces it—**a slow, careful scraping**, like someone drawing something thin along the metal to find a gap.\n\nJuno grabs the corridor rail, eyes wide, and forces words through clenched teeth. “That door—if they’re on the other side when the buffer inflates, they’ll either back off… or they’ll vent it to get in.”\n\n**Status updates**\n- Pressure-door corridor: entered\n- Manual dog: engaged, holding\n- Ticking: stuttered, not gone\n- Cycling: still active, adapting"

Not a sentence you can parse. More like an imitation.\n\nJuno flinches hard at it. You grab her harness and shove; she stumbles forward, catches herself on a smeared handprint, and forces her boots to move again. “Panel—yeah—” she says, voice thin. “There should be a local pressure interlock. Helix likes redundant control in recorder corridors for audit teams.”\n\nYou back them toward the next access, rifle tracking the rear seam. Your light sweeps over a recessed **yellow control box** half-hidden behind a dangling insulation curtain: *PRESSURE INTERLOCK / CORRIDOR ISOLATION*. Its faceplate is scuffed and has a fresh pry mark at one corner—someone’s been in it recently. A manual pull-tab sits under a cracked plastic cover, and a status strip shows **AMBER: AUTO-CYCLE ARMED**.\n\nDown-corridor toward Recorder Service, the amber strips pulse out of sync for a beat—then resync, like the system just accepted a new state.

The grille gives with a sharp *crack* and a spit of brittle screws; stale air burps out, carrying that sweet-ozone note stronger, like warmed plastic and old blood.\n\n**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** you get the vent open and start cranking the bleed wheel. The first quarter-turn fights you—then the mechanism catches and the corridor pressure shifts. Your ears pop under the respirator seal. The taped deck patch behind you stops “drinking” at once; the tape settles flat with a relieved little *slap*.\n\nJuno doesn’t move. She’s a statue at the seam, rifle locked. “Pressure’s changing—yeah,” she says, voice clipped. “Seam flutter stopped. Good.” Then, quieter: “Rhea… something’s *moving inside the latch channel*. Not a hand. Too many joints.”\n\nAs the vent bleeds, the pressure door responds: the latch-side seam relaxes a hair and exhales a thin, steady stream now—controlled, not pulsed. The door face dimples again near the latch and you hear a soft internal ratchet, like someone carefully taking tension off a spring.\n\nAt the same time, down in the open vent throat, something taps back—three light impacts on the duct wall, answering the old knock pattern. The sound is *inside* the ship’s lungs now, not behind the door.\n\nJuno’s muzzle dips a fraction, tracking. “If it shows—” She stops mid-sentence as a shape slides into the seam gap: not a hand, but a narrow, pale strip that looks like tendon under skin. It probes once, testing the edge where your putty was, then withdraws fast, leaving a wet sheen.\n\nYour gear buzzes: the warm puck shard vibrates hard enough to rattle against the tightbeam module. The sealed evidence bag fogs, then clears in a single breath, like something just inhaled through plastic.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES**\n- Vent: open, bleeding pressure  \n- Deck patch: suction stopped  \n- Door seam: steady airflow, probing contact  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```"

The duct answers with a tight, strangled *chitter* from deeper inside, and the knife hilt trembles as whatever’s in there pulls away. A thin ribbon of translucent slime threads down the blade and drips onto your boot.\n\nYou pivot back to the pressure door, shoulder into the latch-side seam, and fire a short burst into the spot where the tendon-strip probed.\n\nThe rounds don’t spark like they should. They hit with dull, meaty thuds—*thup-thup-thup*—and the seam sprays a fine mist that beads on your visor. The door face dimples hard under impact, then rebounds. Something inside shrieks—not loud, but *close*, like it’s vibrating the metal.\n\nJuno obeys instantly. She dumps a controlled burst the moment the seam flexes again. “Contact—multiple segments!” she snaps, and you hear her rounds chew into the latch channel. “Not Helix. Not human.”\n\nYou shove with brute weight. The seam gives you a finger’s width—enough to see darkness and a glint of wet structure behind the dogwork. Then the gap tries to *bite shut* around your shoulder, not by motor—by pressure and flex, like the frame is being pulled inward from the far side.\n\nAt the same time, the vent behind you jerks against the knife wedge—one violent tug—then stills. The knife stays, but the duct wall around it puckers, sealing around the blade like living gasket.\n\nJuno, still locked on the seam, barks through clenched teeth: “Rhea—if you force it, it’ll shear you. We need the dogs off, not muscle. Manual dog socket’s on this frame, but it’s jammed—something’s *holding the latch from the inside*.”\n\nYour warm puck shard rattles in your kit, now in sync with the internal shriek—fast triplets that set your teeth on edge.

Don’t let it.”\n\n**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You draw your sidearm, shove it into the gap, and dump rounds down the latch-side mechanism. The first shots are muffled, then you hit something structural—there’s a sharp *ping* and a shower of bright flakes as a dog tooth or cam surface chips. The flexing stutters. Not gone—but disrupted, like you broke a jaw joint. Something inside answers with a wet, furious scrabble deeper in the door body, retreating from the line of fire.\n\nYou slam the pry bar into the manual dog socket on your side. It *is* there—half-obscured by the frame lip—and it takes the bar with a gritty, reluctant bite. You wrench.\n\nThe socket moves a fraction… then binds hard, as if the dog is being held from the inside by tensioned cable or something braced against it. Your arms shake. The bar creaks. The metal around the socket warms under your glove.\n\nBehind you, the vent throat shudders against the knife wedge—one slow pull this time, testing. The duct wall stays puckered tight around the blade, sealing, but the hilt vibrates like a tuning fork.\n\nJuno’s voice cuts in, tight: “You’re turning it—keep going. Whatever’s inside is *pulling back*. That means it’s not a welded jam; it’s a live hold.”\n\nYou count. “Three, two, one—PUSH!”\n\nYou throw your weight and torque together. The dog finally gives with a brutal *CLACK*—not a full release, but one dog off its seat. The seam jumps wider by a handspan and a breath of colder air rolls out, carrying that sweet-ozone stink and a faint copper note.\n\nIn the widened gap, you catch a glimpse: not a person—an articulated mass tight to the latch assembly, pale and slick, withdrawing fast into the dark as Juno’s next burst rips sparks and wet spray off the frame.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES**\n- Latch dog: partially disengaged  \n- Door seam: widened, unstable  \n- Vent duct: knife wedged, tugging continues  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```"

You slap tape/sealant over the throat fast—hands moving on muscle memory—and the tape bows inward once, twice, then holds. The duct keeps *tapping* behind it, muffled now.\n\nYou’re still on the latch-side of the **SPINE-2 / Recorder Service pressure door corridor**, shoulder to frame, amber strips strobing sick across the wet seam. The gap is still a handspan, breathing cold air into your faceplate in short gusts.\n\nJuno keeps her promise. She leans into her angle and “stitches” the latch channel, rounds chewing the inner frame. “I’m on it—keep your hands clear of the bite,” she says, then adds, grim: “It’s learning the rhythm. It’s timing the flex between bursts.”\n\nYou plant the pry bar into the manual socket for the second dog and wrench. It moves—gritty, resisting—then the socket *kicks back* like something inside just threw weight against it. Your wrist jolts.\n\nYou kick the door edge and shove the rifle through the gap, firing into the dark. The muzzle flash strobes the interior: a narrow service vestibule beyond, slick with condensation, and a pale, jointed shape retreating up the latch-side wall—too fast, too many hinges. Your burst catches something; there’s a wet slap and a spatter across the inner bulkhead. The thing answers by yanking the door inward again—trying to clamp on your rifle.\n\nJuno barks, “Rhea—barrel!” and fires *past* your muzzle into the latch channel. Her rounds strike something hard; you hear a metallic shriek like a cable snapping under load.\n\nThe second dog suddenly turns freer—whatever was bracing it from inside just lost leverage. The pry bar swings another quarter turn with a heavy *CLACK*. The seam jumps wider, and a gust of colder, cleaner air spills out—followed by a thin, sweet stink that makes the back of your throat itch.\n\nSomewhere deeper inside, a low, patterned thrum starts up—like a voice testing a note through the hull.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES**\n- Vent throat: taped, holding  \n- Second dog: partially disengaged  \n- Door gap: widening, unstable  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```"
