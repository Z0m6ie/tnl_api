Rafe Calder tastes salt at the back of his tongue, the way he did when his mother whispered about a debt that ends in water.\n\nHe tells himself he works nights because the pay stays better and the questions stay fewer. He checks padlocks for a bait shop that can’t afford another break-in. He writes times in a small notebook because cameras “fail” when the Harbor Authority wants them to. His phone keeps vibrating in his jacket, and he keeps ignoring it.\n\nA body bumps the pilings and rolls half into view. A Harbor Authority accident tag hangs from the toe, stapled clean through skin. The ink still shines. Rafe steps closer and reads the time of death. It lists tomorrow.\n\nA voice behind him says, “Don’t touch it.” A woman stands under the light with a cheap raincoat and a bruised look around her eyes. She holds a first aid kit like she brought it out of habit, not hope. Her hands shake, but she still looks at the man’s face like he mattered. Rafe doesn’t ask why she’s here. He knows why people come to the water at night.\n\nShe crouches anyway and pulls the tag loose with careful fingers. “He has a kid,” she says. Her throat works. “I saw him on the picket line.”\n\nRafe feels anger come up clean and hot. Not at her. At the neat staple. At the time stamp. At the way the harbor keeps taking and calling it paperwork.\n\nFootsteps scrape on the planks. A flashlight beam cuts the fog. Someone calls out, “Authority sweep. Show your hands.”",

I know who you are.” He steps into the cone of light: Harbor Authority inspector’s jacket over street clothes, badge on a lanyard instead of pinned—**Inspector Dain Rook**. His knuckles are white around the flashlight. Behind him, two Authority uniforms fan out, one angling their light toward the water, the other toward the stacked containers to the east.\n\nRook doesn’t answer your question directly. “Commissioner Harrow’s running it,” he says, and the way he says it makes it sound like he’s repeating someone else’s line. His eyes flick past you—trying to see the woman you’re half-blocking—then down to the body. “This is an accident scene. You didn’t see it. You didn’t log it.”\n\nThe woman behind you inhales sharply; you feel it more than hear it. She keeps her hands close to her raincoat pockets, like she’s hiding the torn-off tag or just her shaking.\n\nTo the west, down the berth, another set of lights sweeps across doors and padlocks—someone else is already checking businesses, tugging on chains, writing something down. Over the water, the buoy bell strikes off-beat again, late by a heartbeat.\n\nRook takes one step closer, lowering his voice. “I can make your name disappear from tonight’s sweep. I need your security logs. Last three nights. Every camera you’ve got access to.” His gaze hardens. “And you’re going to tell your… friend… to go home before she becomes a problem Harrow solves.”\n\nOne of the uniforms calls, “Inspector—Union pickets two piers over. They’re moving this way.”\n\nRook’s jaw ticks. “Clock’s bad tonight,” he mutters, almost to himself, then looks back at you. “So. Who’s running the sweep? Harrow. And she’s hungry.”\n\n**Status updates:** Authority sweep converging; Union patrol nearby; Rook demands three nights’ logs.  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Berth 12\"],\"npcs_add\":[\"Inspector Dain Rook (Harbor Authority)\",\"Unidentified woman in raincoat\",\"Two Harbor Authority officers\"]}```",

She slips sideways along the shadowed edge of a container stack, head down, walking—fast but not running—until the fog swallows her raincoat.\n\nRook notices a beat too late. His flashlight twitches toward where she went, then snaps back to you, jaw clenched. “Dammit, Calder.” He doesn’t order pursuit—either he can’t spare the manpower, or he doesn’t want a report that says a civilian witness got chased.\n\nThe dock under your boots is slick with brine; when the buoy bell hits again it’s still off, like the harbor’s metronome is wrong on purpose. Down-berth, the other sweep team’s lights flare against corrugated doors—padlocks rattling, someone jotting serial numbers.\n\nRook leans in close enough you catch stale coffee on his breath. “Because it was printed before he died,” he says, voice low. “Tags, forms, timestamps—pre-staged. Harrow calls it ‘administrative efficiency.’” His eyes flick to the toe tag you’re staring at. “And if you’re thinking that’s impossible—welcome to my week.”\n\nOne of the uniformed officers, a woman with a clipped ponytail, moves to the body and starts photographing the tag and the face, quick and practiced. The other keeps watch toward the west, where distant voices and the clack of boots on planks are getting louder—Union patrol closing.\n\nRook’s hand shakes when he points his flashlight at your chest, not quite a threat, more like he needs something to hold onto. “I’m not here to burn you. I’m here because if this goes into the system the wrong way, Harrow buries it and the Union riots over it.” His voice drops further. “You want the real answer? Someone above me is running the paperwork ahead of the water. I don’t know how. I just know Harrow’s orders are to seize every private camera angle before sunrise.”\n\nHe glances toward the fog where the woman vanished. “If she talks to Brinehand first, they’ll decide you’re the saboteur. If she talks to Tideglass… she won’t talk again.”\n\n**Status updates:** Witness extracted into fog. Union patrol nearing Berth 12. Rook admits pre-staged tags.",

Nobody touches private equipment without my say.” The ponytailed officer pauses mid-photo, annoyed but obedient. The other officer shifts his stance, light trained west where the boots are getting loud.\n\nThe air tastes like pennies and salt. To the east, the container stack looms like a dark wall, the fog snagging on its corners and sliding down in sheets. The buoy bell hits again—late.\n\nUnion voices swell: rough laughter, a shouted name, the scrape of hook-knives on belt rivets. Rook leans close as you start drifting—casual, unhurried—toward the containers.\n\n“Brinehand’s the union’s teeth,” he murmurs. “They keep the docks ‘safe’ for a price. They also… pay the water. Names go missing when the tide’s wrong.” His throat works. “Tideglass is worse. Charity front. Ledgers, bloodlines, tide charts. They don’t muscle you—they *schedule* you.”\n\nA shout breaks closer: “Authority! Hands off our men!” One of the uniforms starts to answer, but Rook snaps, “Stand down,” like he’s swallowing a lifetime of training.\n\nYou and Rook reach the container stack’s shadow. The temperature drops a degree. His voice goes even lower. “Printer that sees the future?” He shakes his head. “Harrow doesn’t keep it in her office. Paperwork comes out of the Harbor Records annex—old building behind **Ing Boots**. Basement. Restricted after the flood. That’s where the tags get ‘processed’ before they ever hit a toe.”\n\nAs you edge along the containers, a faint gritty crunch underfoot—salt embedded where it shouldn’t be—clings to the sole of your boot like it’s trying to *remember* you crossed here.\n\n**Status updates:** Rook accepts one-hour view.

One has a short gaff hook tucked along his forearm like it’s just another tool; the other keeps his hand near his coat where something metal prints against the fabric. They don’t rush you—your tone and the mention of “riot” lands—but they also don’t stop moving. They angle to bracket you, eyes flicking past your shoulders to Rook and the Authority lights.\n\n“Inspector promised,” the gaff-hand repeats, voice rough with dock smoke. “Inspectors promise a lot.” He tips his chin toward the body. “That one ours. Picket. And we heard he was talking to a *Calder*.”\n\nBehind you, Rook holds his line. He barks, “No contact. No seizures. Stand down,” and for once his uniforms actually do—flashlights dip, batons stay holstered. The ponytailed officer mutters something under her breath but steps back from the corpse.\n\nThe second Night Hand sniffs, like he can smell the ink. “Tag’s fresh,” he says. “Accident label already on him—means Authority’s doing favors for somebody. You telling me who’s paying the water now, Calder? Or you want us asking your friends on every pier?”\n\nA gust pushes the fog sideways; for a heartbeat you can see the corrugated bait-warehouse slit they’d been watching from, rust scraped clean to a bright line. The buoy bell rings again—still off, still wrong—and the Union men glance at the sound like they’ve been trained to hear it as a warning.\n\nTime pressure tightens: if Brinehand decides you’re stalling, they’ll take you or take Rook; if Authority panics, they’ll “secure” the scene and disappear the body. In the middle, the corpse’s toe tag flutters, ink tacky enough to catch dock grit.\n\n**Status updates:** Brinehand Night Hands engaged. Authority holding (for now). Scene on a knife-edge.",

You don’t win trust, but you win a pause; the brine in the air feels less like a brawl and more like a negotiation.\n\n“Paper don’t float,” the gaff-hand mutters, then glances past you toward the Authority lights. “But it does *sink* a man.”\n\nBehind you, Rook keeps his people still. One uniform’s radio crackles; Rook covers the mic with his palm and hisses something you can’t catch. Out on the fog line, a low engine note idles—steady, patient—like a skiff holding position without wanting to be seen.\n\nThe gaff-hand answers your question without blinking. “Family name,” he says. “Not you personally. He said Tideglass has a ledger that don’t just list donations. Lists **debts**. Lists **blood**.” He jerks his chin at the corpse. “He said Pier Nine’s memorial ain’t a memorial. It’s a window. He said your name shows up when the tide chart hits a certain minute.”\n\nThe second Night Hand finally speaks, voice flat. “Last thing he said to me was: ‘If I go under, check the inside of my boot.’ Then he laughed—like he already knew what time he was supposed to die.”\n\nThe gaff-hand looks you over again, weighing the hour you asked for. “One pair of eyes, quiet,” he repeats. “Fine. But if your footage is smoke, Calder, we don’t come back asking.”\n\nHe gestures with two fingers; the second Night Hand steps toward the body—not to touch it, but to stare at the boots, intent and hungry for that detail.\n\n**Status updates:** Brinehand backs off (conditional).  \n**Status updates:** Pier Nine + Tideglass ledger confirmed.  \n**Status updates:** “Inside his boot” lead surfaced.",

Their gaze lifts—almost to your catwalk—then slides away, not quite finding you. “They’re keyed to the bell,” Jory breathes. “That skip was a ‘move’ call.”\n\nFar behind you, deeper in the container maze, the sweep noise swells: boots on metal stairs, a radio squawk, and Rook’s voice cutting off mid-sentence like someone finally pulled rank on him.\n\nYou’ve got a narrow window: high route to the pump house backside, watchers shifting below, and Harrow’s people closing the gap from the rear.\n\n**Status updates:** Watchers repositioning; case stashed  \n**Status updates:** Alternate route: rear vent intake  \n**Status updates:** Harrow sweep pushing closer",

The annex squats off the pump house’s west flank—same concrete, newer steel door, no markings. Sea-side, you can just make out the intake vent: a rectangular grate half-hidden behind a salt-bleached stack of pallets.\n\nJory reaches the drop point first and swings a leg over, lowering himself down the ladder with the same quiet control. He pauses near the bottom, listening—then steps off into the yard shadow.\n\nFor two long seconds you only hear the buoy bell and the distant hum of reefer fans.\n\nThen Jory crouches and lifts a hand in a tight, low wave: **clear—mostly.** He points, two fingers, toward the far corner by the fence line.\n\nA shape is there—someone slumped against the chain-link, hood up, not moving right. Not dead, you think; breathing shallow, like they’re trying not to be heard. A Harbor Authority lanyard catches a smear of light when they shift. Jory mouths up at you: “Inspector’s aide… or a runner.”\n\nBehind you on the catwalk, a radio squawks closer than before, and boots hit metal—Harrow’s sweep entering the reefer lane. A beam of light knifes through fog and briefly paints the underside of your maintenance run.\n\nJory whispers up, urgent: “Drop now. If they flood the yard with light, we’re pinned. Vent bolts are soft—give me thirty seconds and something to lever with.”\n\nThe air down there tastes like wet concrete and old brine; the pump house wall sweats salt in pale streaks.

The voice stays level. “Hand her down, then you. Slow.”\n\nA shape moves into the spill of its own light: not a uniformed Authority officer—no badge flash, no cap—but a rain-dark coat, clean boots, and hands in thin gloves. He steps under the mouth far enough that his head and shoulders are directly beneath Jory’s boots.\n\nJory reacts on instinct and training. He snaps his heel out—hard—catching the light source. It isn’t a flashlight; it’s a small inspection lamp on a short handle. It clatters off the concrete and spins into shadow, plunging the shaft into pump-lit dimness.\n\nThe man below grunts, rocked back a half step. Jory drives a second kick into his chest/shoulder line—enough to break his balance, not enough to launch him. That’s your window.\n\nYou shift onto the ladder and drop your weight down fast, controlled—forearms tight, knife pinned to your thigh so it doesn’t snag. You hit him with a shoulder-and-hip check as he stumbles, both of you slamming into the right wall of the corridor with a wet clang. He’s solid, stronger than he looks, and he immediately tries to turn you into the wall and pin your knife arm.\n\nAbove, Myra holds for two breaths like you said—then her injured side gives a sharp tremor and she whimpers, biting it off. She starts to descend on your movement, one rung at a time, but she’s shaking.\n\nBehind you—up at the vent—metal whispers again: a fastener finally loosening, a faint scrape like a screwdriver turning slow. Whoever’s on the yard side is committing now.\n\nThe man you tackled hisses in your ear, breath steady despite the hit: “Calder. Of course.” His gloved fingers probe for your wrist. “They said you’d come through the intake.”\n\n**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re in the annex intake corridor at the base of the shaft; the wall is cold, wet-painted metal, smelling of bleach over rust.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES:** Corridor contact: engaged, pinned close  \n**STATUS UPDATES:** Shaft above: Myra descending, unstable  \n**STATUS UPDATES:** Yard side: grate being opened",

The vent gap stops widening for a beat—then whoever’s up there lets out a thin, controlled exhale you can hear through the fog ribbon. No boots hit the ladder. Not yet.\n\nThe bleeding man’s eyes track your knife and the bend where Myra disappeared. When you tell him to take his hand out slow, he does—empty palm first—then the other hand follows, bringing out a flat, black tool case no bigger than a paperback. He sets it on the wet floor and nudges it away with his boot like he’s trying to prove he’s not reaching for a weapon.\n\n“Name’s Vell,” he says, voice tight now that his nose is pouring. “Marn Vell. Night auditor. Not patrol.” He touches the bridge of his nose and winces. “And the one who ‘told’ me was Deputy Hume’s office—schedule sheet. Not a whisper. A written expectation.”\n\nAt “what name did Tideglass put on me,” his gaze flicks to the brass buoy-bell token if it’s anywhere visible, then back to your face like he’s weighing how much truth costs.\n\n“They don’t use your first name,” Vell says. “They use *ledger names*. Bloodline marks. You’re listed as **Calder / Owed / Returned**—same wording that’s been showing up on memorial programs and incident tags. It’s not a threat in their language. It’s… a claim already filed.”\n\nAbove, the vent grate gives a soft metallic click as it shifts another fraction—just enough to let a fingertip in. Fog spills thicker, and with it comes a faint scrape like someone testing the edge of the opening with something hard.\n\nVell keeps his hands visible, but his shoulders angle subtly—protective, like he expects the next hit to come from above, not you. “If they get you to say your full name near a buoy or a memorial bell,” he adds, “it goes bad fast.

For a beat nothing moves—then a slow exhale seeps through the crack, careful as a confession.\n\n“I’m… I’m here,” a man whispers back. Young. Hoarse. “Don’t—don’t open it. They’ll hear.” He swallows, and you hear the tiny click of teeth. “I’m not hurt bad. Just—cold. My name’s Corin. Annex runner. They sent me to pull your request before it routed, and I couldn’t. So I hid.”\n\n**Sensory grounding:** You’re still in the Compliance room, terminal glow on your hands; the east doorway is open to the fog-wet corridor, and somewhere deeper in the building a service cart wheel squeals once, then stops.\n\nCorin’s voice tightens. “They’ve got a stamp kit down there that can backdate anything. Bodies, tags, times. If you stay in this room when the sweep hits, they’ll make you the witness and the culprit.”\n\nFrom the corridor, distant boots pick up—more than two sets—moving with purpose, radios murmuring. Not Vex and Marr’s hurried retreat; this is a different cadence, slower, coordinated.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES:** Blocked caller warns: time sync  \n**STATUS UPDATES:** Hidden Annex runner identified (Corin)  \n**STATUS UPDATES:** New sweep team approaching corridor  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[{\"name\":\"Corin\",\"role\":\"Annex runner hiding in service chase\"},{\"name\":\"Unidentified woman (blocked caller)\",\"role\":\"warns about Annex time sync/tide alignment\"}]}\n```",

Two ways.” He pauses like he’s mapping it by touch. “Right branch goes to a painted grille—dumps into the corridor by the pump house yard. Left branch goes up to a ladder junction… but there’s a hatch with a security screw. They sealed it last week.”\n\nYou ease the Compliance door toward mostly-closed.

Tollen’s knuckles go white around it.\n\nMarr steps past Vex, grabs the ringing wall phone mounted just left of the Compliance doorframe—its plastic slick with condensation—and snaps it up. “Harbor Authority, corridor post—” He pauses, looks at you, then hits speaker with his thumb.\n\nStatic. Then a woman’s voice, clipped and practiced. “Marr. Patch to Inspector Rook. Now.” A beat, a breath like paper sliding in a file. “And stop Calder from contaminating Compliance.”\n\nVex’s gaze hardens at the phrasing—*contaminating*—like he’s heard it used before when someone wanted a person erased from a scene. He glances at Tollen. “Courier doesn’t enter without an order logged,” Vex says, careful but firm, loud enough for the speaker to catch. “You have an incident number?”\n\nTollen stammers, “It’s internal—he said no—”\n\nOn the speaker, the voice sharpens. “Vex. He’s not a witness, he’s a problem. Move him.”\n\nFrom behind the painted grille seam down the service chase, there’s a faint metallic rasp—someone shifting deeper toward the pump yard route you breathed.

His eyes flick to you once: *I’m with you, but I can’t say it.*\n\nMarr, hands hovering over the keys, quietly adds another log line—his knuckles white: **KINT ORDERED OFFICER TO SECURE COMPROMISED PACKAGE — NO TECH AVAILABLE.** He doesn’t look up when the printer spits the strip; he just tears it off and folds it into his pocket like a confession.\n\nYou angle on Tollen. The man’s face shines with sweat under the buzzing fluorescent, fog beading on his hairline. He swallows, glances at the camera, then at Vex, then at the satchel like it’s going to drag him under. “Myra… Venn,” he says, voice cracking. “Records clerk. Annex supply—keys and forms.” He rushes the rest out, trying to get ahead of his own panic. “Foreman Corin told me. Said it was pre-cleared from Records. Said—said it was ‘for the sweep’ and I wasn’t to ask questions.”\n\nAt the far end of the corridor—deeper in Compliance—the cart wheel squeal you heard earlier stops for good. A door latch gives a soft, careful click, like someone just decided to stay put and listen rather than move again.\n\nKint comes back on, a fraction too fast. “That name is irrelevant. Tollen is under investigation for mishandling Authority property. Officer Vex—remove Calder from the corridor.” She can’t win the evidence fight cleanly, so she tries to move you out of frame.\n\nThe fog keeps breathing through the west service door seam; the damp patch under the satchel widens by a finger’s width, and the torn seal curls another millimeter—paper fibers drinking saltwater.\n\n**Status updates**\n- Vex: holds line, no touch  \n- Marr: logs Kint’s order  \n- Tollen: IDs Myra Venn, Corin  \n- Kint: orders you removed",

He leans toward the mic, voice tight but audible: “For the corridor log: Subject Tollen states Records clerk **Myra Venn** and Foreman **Corin** instructed a ‘pre-cleared’ delivery ‘for the sweep.’ Statement made on camera. Timestamp appended.” The terminal prints the read-back line; the paper’s still warm when he tears it free.\n\nOn speaker, Kint goes cold-silent for a beat—then you hear the faint click of her muting and unmuting, like she’s deciding what she can afford to say on record. “Noted,” she finally says. “Officer Vex, continue removal. Officer Marr, lock the terminal.”\n\nThe corridor smells like wet concrete and ozone from the buzzing light strip overhead. To the west, fog presses through the service-door seam in slow pulses, and the orange tape trembles slightly with the building’s ventilation.\n\nVex keeps his boots planted at the tape line like you told him, eyes forward. Quiet, without moving his lips much: “I’m not touching it.

But the timing is a confession all the same.\n\nVex snaps his chin up toward the dome out of reflex, then back to the tape.

His boots don’t move.\n\nThe woman in the rain shell stops exactly at the tape—close enough that the fog-slick orange plastic kisses her shins when the ventilation breathes. She doesn’t give you name and badge. She gives you procedure, like a shield. “Authority Internal Compliance,” she says. “You don’t need my number to comply.” Her gloved hand lifts—not to the satchel yet, but to a small black device clipped inside her sleeve. A portable signal jammer, the kind that makes cameras “go down for maintenance.”\n\nMarr’s fingers hover over the keyboard. He doesn’t lock the terminal.

She lowers her voice and says, carefully, “You’re interfering with an internal secure item.

Harlan immediately keys his radio. “Control, time-stamp: attempted latch manipulation heard at Compliance intake. Holding door. No exit until Oversight arrives.” He keeps his body square to the jamb, eyes fixed on the seam.\n\nKint comes back on speaker, brisk and authoritative. “Control is directed: time-stamp and log—**no exit from Compliance intake until Lt. Sorn arrives**.” You can hear her typing or someone else in the room moving paper. “Sorn is already bringing a camera. Witness: I’m assigning **Deputy Commissioner Sable Kint** as remote witness on open line; on-scene witness will be Sorn plus corridor officers.”\n\nThe air in the corridor tastes like old toner and salt. To the west, the main hall’s fluorescent wash flickers as a cart rolls past somewhere out of sight; to the east, the Compliance door’s lightline trembles—someone inside shifts their weight close enough that the hinge creaks.\n\nDane speaks through the door, clipped and angry now that he’s being recorded and boxed in. “There is no manipulation. Intake is suspended. I’m requesting supervisor.” His voice drops a fraction. “You’re making this worse.”\n\nVex, still on dispatch, murmurs without looking away from the door: “Sorn’s ETA just tightened. Two minutes.”\n\nThen—under the door, near the threshold—something thin and pale slides into view for an instant, like a strip of paper being tested against the bottom gap, then yanked back. Not enough to identify, but enough to tell you someone inside is trying to move *something* without opening the door.\n\nOutside the building, that off-beat buoy-bell tone leaks faintly through the vent again—wrong rhythm, wrong comfort.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES**\n- Control: “no exit” time-stamped  \n- Latch noise: stopped, logged  \n- Lt.

You misheard.”\n\nYour camera catches the lie in the room’s movement: the lightline at the door seam jitters twice, like two bodies shifting to avoid being seen. And from inside, a second voice—muffled, female, tight with urgency—cuts in for half a word before being smothered: “—Dain, don’t—”\n\nHarlan’s jaw tightens. He keeps his boot sealing the bottom gap and raises his radio again. “Control, possible second party inside Compliance intake. Audio capture: second voice, female.”\n\nYou call down the hall and the approaching footsteps answer you: Lt. Marek Sorn rounds the corner hard, coat open, camera already up in one hand and an evidence bag kit in the other. Behind him is a uniformed corridor officer acting as witness, eyes wide, staying deliberately in frame when Sorn angles his lens.\n\nSorn doesn’t waste words. “Rafe, keep recording. Harlan, don’t touch the handle.” He steps to your side first—exactly as Vex relays—panning his camera over the **pried placard corner**, catching the tamper marks, then down to Harlan’s boot sealing the gap. “Placard tampering documented. Threshold denial documented.”\n\n**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re still tight to the wall opposite the Compliance intake door; the air is stale office-cold with a salt bite drifting in from the vents.\n\n**MULTIPLE ACTIVE THREADS:** Vex stays half a pace back, repeating your instruction—“Placard first, witness in frame”—as Sorn’s lens tracks. From inside the room, paper shuffles faster, then stops dead as if they’ve frozen at the sound of the camera. Down the corridor behind Sorn, more distant boots approach—Authority backup drawn by the radio traffic, not yet visible.\n\nSorn speaks toward the door, voice flat with procedure. “Compliance intake, this is Oversight. Identify all persons inside and state purpose. Failure to comply is a reportable obstruction.” He gestures to the evidence bag and gloves. “If anything comes under that door, we bag it without contact and we log time to the second.”\n\n**STATUS UPDATES**\n- Lt. Sorn: on scene, filming  \n- Second voice: partially captured  \n- Placard tampering: documented by Oversight  \n- Door gap: sealed, transfer denied  \n\n```json\n{\"npcs_add\":[\"Lt.

We have a live restraint and attempted movement risk.” Control comes back fast this time: “Copy. Initiating corridor and stairwell hold. Duty supervisor ETA two minutes.”\n\nDown the corridor, the incoming boots arrive in a cluster: two Harbor Authority officers in sweep vests and a third in plainclothes with a flashlight held like a baton. Your “stay in frame” call checks them—barely. They slow at Harlan’s planted boot and Sorn’s camera, but the plainclothes man keeps edging, eyes flicking to the ceiling vents and the access panel behind you like he’s mapping exits.\n\n**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re still pinned in the narrow service corridor outside FILES/Compliance; the air is cold and metallic, with that brine-and-oil draft breathing out of the wall seams.\n\n**MULTIPLE ACTIVE THREADS:** Harlan’s calf shakes harder; he’s holding the line but he’s not built for a prolonged shove match. The pried placard corner lifts a hair more as pressure shifts behind the door—someone inside bumped it. And from somewhere deeper in the building, a distant door alarm chirps once, then cuts—like a lockout just started taking effect.\n\n**ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT:** If Rook realizes the annex routes are being sealed, his next move is likely force—either to open the door outward into you, or to move Myra through an internal passage before the lockdown fully bites.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES**\n- Myra’s hands shown on record  \n- Rook escalated to threats  \n- Annex access lockdown initiating  \n- Sweep officers arrived at line",

Deputy Commissioner Kint.” He doesn’t produce a badge—just taps the inside of his coat where something hard sits, like he expects the title to do the work. Your phone catches his face, his hands, and the sweep vests behind him.\n\nAt the door, your warning lands. Inside: a strained pause, then Myra’s voice again, closer, controlled through pain. “I’m here. He’s—” A hand slaps the door from the inside—flat palm, not a knock code—then silence. The seam shows a thin line of shadow shifting as if someone inside leaned their weight against it, testing.\n\nRook answers, breath tight. “You’re not trained for this, Calder. You don’t know what’s in the intake route.” That’s the first time he’s admitted it out loud: **intake route**.\n\nHarlan shifts with you—shoulder-to-shoulder—and nods once at your “first inch” plan, jaw clenched.

He raises his phone (not a duty cam—personal) and angles it at the panel like he wants proof of *someone else* breaking procedure.\n\n**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re boxed in: FILES/Compliance door in front, service access panel behind, fog-cold air bleeding through the wall seams and tasting faintly of brine over disinfectant.\n\n**MULTIPLE ACTIVE THREADS:** The two sweep-vest officers hang back at your “line,” but one keeps palming his radio like he’s getting updated orders. Sorn stays steady, camera trained, but he’s watching Vex now as much as the door. And from somewhere above the ceiling tiles, a soft scrape travels—like something being dragged along a duct run toward this corridor.\n\n**ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT:** Lockdowns are starting, but they’re not instantaneous; if someone inside has a lead on an internal bypass (service chase/duct), they’ll try it before the supervisor arrives.

Observed movement in chase—metal scrape, then stop.”\n\nThe sweep-vest officer you point at hesitates—eyes flicking to Vex’s coat, then to Sorn’s camera. Your insistence on hands visible and “don’t disappear with them” hits a nerve. He steps over to the panel side, palms out where the lens can see them. “I’m not— I’m standing. I’m standing,” he mutters, like he’s trying to convince himself as much as you.\n\nYour call to Control goes through clean.

A hand appears—gloved, work-worn—fingers hooking the edge to pull it wider. Sorn’s narration tightens: “Hand visible in chase—glove, dark cuff—attempting to open—” The sweep-vest officer flinches but holds position, blocking the opening with his body angle without actually touching the hand.\n\nFrom inside FILES/Compliance, Myra makes a sound—half gasp, half shout—then the dull thud of a shoulder or hip hitting the door from the other side. Not a full kick, but a desperate confirmation she’s still close enough to fight.\n\nRook’s voice cuts through the seam, sharp and furious now, aimed inward: “Stop—she stays quiet. We’re not—” The rest is swallowed by a scuffle, fabric rasping, and something hard clacking against metal—like a keyring or a stamp kit dropped.\n\nThe corridor’s air turns colder as the panel gap widens a fraction; it smells like wet concrete and brine, like the building’s guts have been rinsed with harbor water.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES**\n- Control: supervisor + units dispatched  \n- Sorn: panel filmed, narrated  \n- Panel: gloved hand visible  \n- Myra: impact on door heard",

The harbor feels watchful: intimate, unforgiving, and hungry.",
      "Dockside power splits three ways. The Harbor Authority sells itself as safety and regulation, but its old families quietly launder “accidents” into paperwork to keep the Calder sea-debt contained and profitable. The Brinehand Union, public champions of longshoremen and night labor, runs protection and “lost cargo” recovery—while feeding chosen names to the water in exchange for calm tides and steady work. Across both moves the Tideglass Fellowship, a charitable maritime heritage society; beneath the varnish it’s a cult mapping bloodlines and timing ritual drownings to tighten the sea-god’s claim. The Authority leans on Union muscle, the Union resents Authority crackdowns, and Tideglass plays them against each other with favors, fog, and fear.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"factions\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Harbor Authority\",\n      \"public_front\": \"Port safety, licensing, inspections, and incident response.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Old families bury ritual drownings as “accidents,” steering investigations and payouts to keep the Calder sea-debt managed and monetized.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Brinehand Union\",\n      \"public_front\": \"Longshoremen’s union protecting workers, wages, and night-shift conditions.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Runs dockside protection and discreet recovery; offers select victims to the sea-god to secure calm waters and guaranteed work.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Tideglass Fellowship\",\n      \"public_front\": \"Maritime heritage charity funding buoy upkeep, sailor memorials, and community aid.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Cult conducting and scheduling ritual drownings, tracing bloodlines (including the Calders) to strengthen the sea-god’s claim and leverage.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

      "Fog has settled for three nights straight, and with it the water has started giving bodies back—each with Harbor Authority “accident” tags already stamped, as if the paperwork beat the tide. Commissioner Lysa Harrow orders a midnight “safety sweep” that’s really a purge of witnesses. The Brinehand Union answers with an unofficial strike and roving pickets, shaking down shops for “protection” while they hunt whoever’s disrupting their offerings. Meanwhile the Tideglass Fellowship announces a candlelit memorial on Pier Nine, quietly timing it to a rare tide window—Rafe’s name surfacing in their ledgers.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"events\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"The Returned With Paperwork\",\n      \"description\": \"Bodies surface with Harbor Authority accident tags already filed, implying a coordinated cover-up.

      "Rafe’s phone won’t stop vibrating—three clients, two panicked dock bosses, and one blocked number that only calls when the fog is thick. A body turned up under Berth 12 with a Harbor Authority “accident” tag already stapled to the toe, ink still tacky. The dead man was a Brinehand picket Rafe paid last week for information, and the tag lists a time of death that hasn’t happened yet.\n\nCommissioner Lysa Harrow’s midnight “safety sweep” hits Rafe’s world first: every camera on his routes, every ledger with his signature, every quiet favor that keeps waterfront businesses breathing. An Authority inspector offers him a deal—turn over security logs from the last three nights, and Harrow will “lose” his name in the sweep. The inspector’s hands shake like he’s repeating someone else’s words.\n\nOutside, Union patrols are already leaning on Rafe’s contacts. They’re hunting a saboteur—someone interrupting the old offerings—and they’re convinced a Calder is involved. A Union foreman slips Rafe a warning in a grease-stained envelope: a Tideglass memorial program for Pier Nine, with a handwritten note in the margin—**CALDER / OWED / RETURNED**—and a tide chart marked to the minute.\n\nRafe has his mother’s stories, his father’s storm-vanishing, and the taste of salt that shows up in his mouth when he’s close to trouble.

Rafe Calder tastes salt at the back of his tongue, the way he did when his mother whispered about a debt that ends in water.\n\nHe tells himself he works nights because the pay stays better and the questions stay fewer. He checks padlocks for a bait shop that can’t afford another break-in. He writes times in a small notebook because cameras “fail” when the Harbor Authority wants them to. His phone keeps vibrating in his jacket, and he keeps ignoring it.\n\nA body bumps the pilings and rolls half into view. A Harbor Authority accident tag hangs from the toe, stapled clean through skin. The ink still shines. Rafe steps closer and reads the time of death. It lists tomorrow.\n\nA voice behind him says, “Don’t touch it.” A woman stands under the light with a cheap raincoat and a bruised look around her eyes. She holds a first aid kit like she brought it out of habit, not hope. Her hands shake, but she still looks at the man’s face like he mattered. Rafe doesn’t ask why she’s here. He knows why people come to the water at night.\n\nShe crouches anyway and pulls the tag loose with careful fingers. “He has a kid,” she says. Her throat works. “I saw him on the picket line.”\n\nRafe feels anger come up clean and hot. Not at her. At the neat staple. At the time stamp. At the way the harbor keeps taking and calling it paperwork.\n\nFootsteps scrape on the planks. A flashlight beam cuts the fog. Someone calls out, “Authority sweep. Show your hands.”"

Rust bleeds down corrugated shutters; rope fibers rasp under callused fingers; diesel and brine and old fish rot mingle with the faint, coppery tang of something recently spilled.

The harbor feels watchful: intimate, unforgiving, and hungry.",
      "Dockside power splits three ways. The Harbor Authority sells itself as safety and regulation, but its old families quietly launder “accidents” into paperwork to keep the Calder sea-debt contained and profitable. The Brinehand Union, public champions of longshoremen and night labor, runs protection and “lost cargo” recovery—while feeding chosen names to the water in exchange for calm tides and steady work. Across both moves the Tideglass Fellowship, a charitable maritime heritage society; beneath the varnish it’s a cult mapping bloodlines and timing ritual drownings to tighten the sea-god’s claim. The Authority leans on Union muscle, the Union resents Authority crackdowns, and Tideglass plays them against each other with favors, fog, and fear.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"factions\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Harbor Authority\",\n      \"public_front\": \"Port safety, licensing, inspections, and incident response.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Old families bury ritual drownings as “accidents,” steering investigations and payouts to keep the Calder sea-debt managed and monetized.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Brinehand Union\",\n      \"public_front\": \"Longshoremen’s union protecting workers, wages, and night-shift conditions.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Runs dockside protection and discreet recovery; offers select victims to the sea-god to secure calm waters and guaranteed work.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Tideglass Fellowship\",\n      \"public_front\": \"Maritime heritage charity funding buoy upkeep, sailor memorials, and community aid.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Cult conducting and scheduling ritual drownings, tracing bloodlines (including the Calders) to strengthen the sea-god’s claim and leverage.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

      "Fog has settled for three nights straight, and with it the water has started giving bodies back—each with Harbor Authority “accident” tags already stamped, as if the paperwork beat the tide. Commissioner Lysa Harrow orders a midnight “safety sweep” that’s really a purge of witnesses. The Brinehand Union answers with an unofficial strike and roving pickets, shaking down shops for “protection” while they hunt whoever’s disrupting their offerings. Meanwhile the Tideglass Fellowship announces a candlelit memorial on Pier Nine, quietly timing it to a rare tide window—Rafe’s name surfacing in their ledgers.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"events\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"The Returned With Paperwork\",\n      \"description\": \"Bodies surface with Harbor Authority accident tags already filed, implying a coordinated cover-up.

      "Rafe’s phone won’t stop vibrating—three clients, two panicked dock bosses, and one blocked number that only calls when the fog is thick. A body turned up under Berth 12 with a Harbor Authority “accident” tag already stapled to the toe, ink still tacky. The dead man was a Brinehand picket Rafe paid last week for information, and the tag lists a time of death that hasn’t happened yet.\n\nCommissioner Lysa Harrow’s midnight “safety sweep” hits Rafe’s world first: every camera on his routes, every ledger with his signature, every quiet favor that keeps waterfront businesses breathing. An Authority inspector offers him a deal—turn over security logs from the last three nights, and Harrow will “lose” his name in the sweep. The inspector’s hands shake like he’s repeating someone else’s words.\n\nOutside, Union patrols are already leaning on Rafe’s contacts. They’re hunting a saboteur—someone interrupting the old offerings—and they’re convinced a Calder is involved. A Union foreman slips Rafe a warning in a grease-stained envelope: a Tideglass memorial program for Pier Nine, with a handwritten note in the margin—**CALDER / OWED / RETURNED**—and a tide chart marked to the minute.\n\nRafe has his mother’s stories, his father’s storm-vanishing, and the taste of salt that shows up in his mouth when he’s close to trouble. Now the water is giving bodies back with paperwork attached, and someone is trying to make sure the next one is him—or someone he can’t afford to lose.\n\nIn the fog, a buoy bell keeps time slightly wrong, like it’s counting down."

Rafe Calder tastes salt at the back of his tongue, the way he did when his mother whispered about a debt that ends in water.\n\nHe tells himself he works nights because the pay stays better and the questions stay fewer. He checks padlocks for a bait shop that can’t afford another break-in. He writes times in a small notebook because cameras “fail” when the Harbor Authority wants them to. His phone keeps vibrating in his jacket, and he keeps ignoring it.\n\nA body bumps the pilings and rolls half into view. A Harbor Authority accident tag hangs from the toe, stapled clean through skin. The ink still shines. Rafe steps closer and reads the time of death. It lists tomorrow.\n\nA voice behind him says, “Don’t touch it.” A woman stands under the light with a cheap raincoat and a bruised look around her eyes. She holds a first aid kit like she brought it out of habit, not hope. Her hands shake, but she still looks at the man’s face like he mattered. Rafe doesn’t ask why she’s here. He knows why people come to the water at night.\n\nShe crouches anyway and pulls the tag loose with careful fingers. “He has a kid,” she says. Her throat works. “I saw him on the picket line.”\n\nRafe feels anger come up clean and hot. Not at her. At the neat staple. At the time stamp. At the way the harbor keeps taking and calling it paperwork.\n\nFootsteps scrape on the planks. A flashlight beam cuts the fog. Someone calls out, “Authority sweep. Show your hands.”"

I know who you are.” He steps into the cone of light: Harbor Authority inspector’s jacket over street clothes, badge on a lanyard instead of pinned—**Inspector Dain Rook**. His knuckles are white around the flashlight. Behind him, two Authority uniforms fan out, one angling their light toward the water, the other toward the stacked containers to the east.\n\nRook doesn’t answer your question directly. “Commissioner Harrow’s running it,” he says, and the way he says it makes it sound like he’s repeating someone else’s line. His eyes flick past you—trying to see the woman you’re half-blocking—then down to the body. “This is an accident scene. You didn’t see it. You didn’t log it.”\n\nThe woman behind you inhales sharply; you feel it more than hear it. She keeps her hands close to her raincoat pockets, like she’s hiding the torn-off tag or just her shaking.\n\nTo the west, down the berth, another set of lights sweeps across doors and padlocks—someone else is already checking businesses, tugging on chains, writing something down. Over the water, the buoy bell strikes off-beat again, late by a heartbeat.\n\nRook takes one step closer, lowering his voice. “I can make your name disappear from tonight’s sweep. I need your security logs. Last three nights. Every camera you’ve got access to.” His gaze hardens. “And you’re going to tell your… friend… to go home before she becomes a problem Harrow solves.”\n\nOne of the uniforms calls, “Inspector—Union pickets two piers over. They’re moving this way.”\n\nRook’s jaw ticks. “Clock’s bad tonight,” he mutters, almost to himself, then looks back at you. “So. Who’s running the sweep? Harrow. And she’s hungry.”\n\n**Status updates:** Authority sweep converging; Union patrol nearby; Rook demands three nights’ logs.  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Berth 12\"],\"npcs_add\":[\"Inspector Dain Rook (Harbor Authority)\",\"Unidentified woman in raincoat\",\"Two Harbor Authority officers\"]}```"

She slips sideways along the shadowed edge of a container stack, head down, walking—fast but not running—until the fog swallows her raincoat.\n\nRook notices a beat too late. His flashlight twitches toward where she went, then snaps back to you, jaw clenched. “Dammit, Calder.” He doesn’t order pursuit—either he can’t spare the manpower, or he doesn’t want a report that says a civilian witness got chased.\n\nThe dock under your boots is slick with brine; when the buoy bell hits again it’s still off, like the harbor’s metronome is wrong on purpose. Down-berth, the other sweep team’s lights flare against corrugated doors—padlocks rattling, someone jotting serial numbers.\n\nRook leans in close enough you catch stale coffee on his breath. “Because it was printed before he died,” he says, voice low. “Tags, forms, timestamps—pre-staged. Harrow calls it ‘administrative efficiency.’” His eyes flick to the toe tag you’re staring at. “And if you’re thinking that’s impossible—welcome to my week.”\n\nOne of the uniformed officers, a woman with a clipped ponytail, moves to the body and starts photographing the tag and the face, quick and practiced. The other keeps watch toward the west, where distant voices and the clack of boots on planks are getting louder—Union patrol closing.\n\nRook’s hand shakes when he points his flashlight at your chest, not quite a threat, more like he needs something to hold onto. “I’m not here to burn you. I’m here because if this goes into the system the wrong way, Harrow buries it and the Union riots over it.” His voice drops further. “You want the real answer? Someone above me is running the paperwork ahead of the water. I don’t know how. I just know Harrow’s orders are to seize every private camera angle before sunrise.”\n\nHe glances toward the fog where the woman vanished. “If she talks to Brinehand first, they’ll decide you’re the saboteur. If she talks to Tideglass… she won’t talk again.”\n\n**Status updates:** Witness extracted into fog. Union patrol nearing Berth 12. Rook admits pre-staged tags."

While they’re yelling, you and I walk—quiet—toward the container stack. You’re going to tell me what Brinehand and Tideglass are, and you’re going to tell me where Harrow keeps the printer that can see the future.”"

Nobody touches private equipment without my say.” The ponytailed officer pauses mid-photo, annoyed but obedient. The other officer shifts his stance, light trained west where the boots are getting loud.\n\nThe air tastes like pennies and salt. To the east, the container stack looms like a dark wall, the fog snagging on its corners and sliding down in sheets. The buoy bell hits again—late.\n\nUnion voices swell: rough laughter, a shouted name, the scrape of hook-knives on belt rivets. Rook leans close as you start drifting—casual, unhurried—toward the containers.\n\n“Brinehand’s the union’s teeth,” he murmurs. “They keep the docks ‘safe’ for a price. They also… pay the water. Names go missing when the tide’s wrong.” His throat works. “Tideglass is worse. Charity front. Ledgers, bloodlines, tide charts. They don’t muscle you—they *schedule* you.”\n\nA shout breaks closer: “Authority! Hands off our men!” One of the uniforms starts to answer, but Rook snaps, “Stand down,” like he’s swallowing a lifetime of training.\n\nYou and Rook reach the container stack’s shadow. The temperature drops a degree. His voice goes even lower. “Printer that sees the future?” He shakes his head. “Harrow doesn’t keep it in her office. Paperwork comes out of the Harbor Records annex—old building behind **Ing Boots**. Basement. Restricted after the flood. That’s where the tags get ‘processed’ before they ever hit a toe.”\n\nAs you edge along the containers, a faint gritty crunch underfoot—salt embedded where it shouldn’t be—clings to the sole of your boot like it’s trying to *remember* you crossed here.\n\n**Status updates:** Rook accepts one-hour view.

Two Brinehand “Night Hands” in oilskins resolve out of the haze by the bait-warehouse shutters, exactly where the darkness is thickest. One has a short gaff hook tucked along his forearm like it’s just another tool; the other keeps his hand near his coat where something metal prints against the fabric. They don’t rush you—your tone and the mention of “riot” lands—but they also don’t stop moving. They angle to bracket you, eyes flicking past your shoulders to Rook and the Authority lights.\n\n“Inspector promised,” the gaff-hand repeats, voice rough with dock smoke. “Inspectors promise a lot.” He tips his chin toward the body. “That one ours. Picket. And we heard he was talking to a *Calder*.”\n\nBehind you, Rook holds his line. He barks, “No contact. No seizures. Stand down,” and for once his uniforms actually do—flashlights dip, batons stay holstered. The ponytailed officer mutters something under her breath but steps back from the corpse.\n\nThe second Night Hand sniffs, like he can smell the ink. “Tag’s fresh,” he says. “Accident label already on him—means Authority’s doing favors for somebody.

It’s… a claim already filed.”\n\nAbove, the vent grate gives a soft metallic click as it shifts another fraction—just enough to let a fingertip in.

His eyes flick to you once: *I’m with you, but I can’t say it.*\n\nMarr, hands hovering over the keys, quietly adds another log line—his knuckles white: **KINT ORDERED OFFICER TO SECURE COMPROMISED PACKAGE — NO TECH AVAILABLE.** He doesn’t look up when the printer spits the strip; he just tears it off and folds it into his pocket like a confession.\n\nYou angle on Tollen. The man’s face shines with sweat under the buzzing fluorescent, fog beading on his hairline. He swallows, glances at the camera, then at Vex, then at the satchel like it’s going to drag him under. “Myra… Venn,” he says, voice cracking. “Records clerk. Annex supply—keys and forms.” He rushes the rest out, trying to get ahead of his own panic. “Foreman Corin told me. Said it was pre-cleared from Records. Said—said it was ‘for the sweep’ and I wasn’t to ask questions.”\n\nAt the far end of the corridor—deeper in Compliance—the cart wheel squeal you heard earlier stops for good. A door latch gives a soft, careful click, like someone just decided to stay put and listen rather than move again.\n\nKint comes back on, a fraction too fast. “That name is irrelevant. Tollen is under investigation for mishandling Authority property. Officer Vex—remove Calder from the corridor.” She can’t win the evidence fight cleanly, so she tries to move you out of frame.\n\nThe fog keeps breathing through the west service door seam; the damp patch under the satchel widens by a finger’s width, and the torn seal curls another millimeter—paper fibers drinking saltwater.\n\n**Status updates**\n- Vex: holds line, no touch  \n- Marr: logs Kint’s order  \n- Tollen: IDs Myra Venn, Corin  \n- Kint: orders you removed"

He leans toward the mic, voice tight but audible: “For the corridor log: Subject Tollen states Records clerk **Myra Venn** and Foreman **Corin** instructed a ‘pre-cleared’ delivery ‘for the sweep.’ Statement made on camera. Timestamp appended.” The terminal prints the read-back line; the paper’s still warm when he tears it free.\n\nOn speaker, Kint goes cold-silent for a beat—then you hear the faint click of her muting and unmuting, like she’s deciding what she can afford to say on record. “Noted,” she finally says. “Officer Vex, continue removal. Officer Marr, lock the terminal.”\n\nThe corridor smells like wet concrete and ozone from the buzzing light strip overhead. To the west, fog presses through the service-door seam in slow pulses, and the orange tape trembles slightly with the building’s ventilation.\n\nVex keeps his boots planted at the tape line like you told him, eyes forward.

He’s close enough now you can smell his wet wool and cheap coffee, but he doesn’t grab you. “Officer Harlan,” he says, clipped, and taps the metal on his chest. “Badge **4-19**.” He says it like he’s been trained to say it only when forced—then his eyes flick to Vex and the speaker as if to confirm witnesses exist. He keeps his hands visible, but he’s planted himself between you and the Compliance door.\n\nOn speaker, Kint goes quiet through your one-sentence summary—quiet in a way that means it landed hard. When she speaks again, her tone is different: professional, colder. “Dispatch received. Stay where you are. Do not enter Compliance. Officer Harlan will maintain the line.” A beat. “Calder—repeat the locker number.” She wants it on the recording twice.\n\nBehind the Compliance door, the cart shifts—rubber wheels squeak as it’s pulled back a few inches, like someone realized you’re listening. A latch clicks once, not opening—just tested. The smaller administrative stamp hits again: *thunk… thunk*, faster now, like someone trying to get ahead of a paper trail.\n\nVex does exactly what you asked. Without raising his voice, he says clearly, “Time is—” and reads it off his phone down to the minute, then adds, “Officer Harlan seized no property at this time; recording ongoing.” It’s a warning wrapped as documentation.

Deputy Kint monitoring.”\n\nThe strip light above you buzzes; a thin line of condensation slides down the wall by your shoulder, cold against your sleeve.

Silence for half a second—then the Compliance door cracks open two inches against the security latch. A sliver of fluorescent light spills into the foggy corridor, cutting across Officer Harlan’s boots.\n\nA man’s voice answers from the gap, irritated and careful. “Compliance Technician **Errol Dane**,” he says, like he’s reading it off a badge he doesn’t want you to see. “You are not authorized to address staff during an active intake.” The door doesn’t open further. You catch only fragments: a pale sleeve, a clipboard edge, and the corner of a rolling cart parked sideways inside—blocking the line to whatever lockers sit beyond.\n\nHarlan shifts with the door, angling his body to keep you pinned in place without touching you. His hand hovers near his radio. “You got your name,” he mutters to you, low. “Don’t push for more.”\n\nFrom inside, Dane adds something that matters: “Locker C-17 is **sealed pending supervisor sign-off**.” That’s either procedure—or a way to buy time to swap contents.

Marek Sorn**. I’m directing him to Compliance intake corridor now.” A beat, then the part she doesn’t like saying out loud: “Supervisor sign-off for evidence lockers is **Inspector Dain Rook**. ETA… unknown.” Her voice hardens. “Calder, stay put. Harlan, you do not seize Calder’s device unless I order it.”\n\nThat lands.

And from somewhere deeper in the building, a distant door alarm chirps once, then cuts—like a lockout just started taking effect.\n\n**ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT:** If Rook realizes the annex routes are being sealed, his next move is likely force—either to open the door outward into you, or to move Myra through an internal passage before the lockdown fully bites.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES**\n- Myra’s hands shown on record  \n- Rook escalated to threats  \n- Annex access lockdown initiating  \n- Sweep officers arrived at line"

Put Myra back at the seam—hands visible—and step back. If this door moves before the supervisor arrives, I’m treating it as a breach and you’re the one escalating.”  \n\nI slide my shoulder closer to Harlan and murmur, “If they surge, don’t try to be a hero—let the door take the first inch and we pin it with weight,” then I glance at the access panel behind us and bark to Vex, “Watch that panel—if it pops, you shout and you film.”"

Deputy Commissioner Kint.” He doesn’t produce a badge—just taps the inside of his coat where something hard sits, like he expects the title to do the work. Your phone catches his face, his hands, and the sweep vests behind him.\n\nAt the door, your warning lands. Inside: a strained pause, then Myra’s voice again, closer, controlled through pain. “I’m here. He’s—” A hand slaps the door from the inside—flat palm, not a knock code—then silence. The seam shows a thin line of shadow shifting as if someone inside leaned their weight against it, testing.\n\nRook answers, breath tight. “You’re not trained for this, Calder. You don’t know what’s in the intake route.” That’s the first time he’s admitted it out loud: **intake route**.\n\nHarlan shifts with you—shoulder-to-shoulder—and nods once at your “first inch” plan, jaw clenched. He’s ready to take the hit, not the glory.\n\nBehind you, the access panel gives a tiny metallic *tick*—not open, just unlatched enough to whisper. Vex’s eyes snap to it the instant you tell him to watch it; he’s been waiting for that moment. He raises his phone (not a duty cam—personal) and angles it at the panel like he wants proof of *someone else* breaking procedure.\n\n**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re boxed in: FILES/Compliance door in front, service access panel behind, fog-cold air bleeding through the wall seams and tasting faintly of brine over disinfectant.\n\n**MULTIPLE ACTIVE THREADS:** The two sweep-vest officers hang back at your “line,” but one keeps palming his radio like he’s getting updated orders. Sorn stays steady, camera trained, but he’s watching Vex now as much as the door. And from somewhere above the ceiling tiles, a soft scrape travels—like something being dragged along a duct run toward this corridor.\n\n**ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT:** Lockdowns are starting, but they’re not instantaneous; if someone inside has a lead on an internal bypass (service chase/duct), they’ll try it before the supervisor arrives. If the door surges outward, you and Harlan take the impact first.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES**\n- Plainclothes ID: “Tomas Vex” claimed  \n- Rook admitted “intake route”  \n- Access panel: latch just ticked  \n- Myra audible again, cut off"

Control needs to know we’ve got a bypass attempt behind us.” Then to Vex (our Vex), low and urgent: “If that panel opens, you shout ‘BREACH’ and don’t touch whoever comes through—just keep them in frame.”"

Now stop turning this into theater.”\n\nHarlan and you lean in together; the door gives a millimeter under your combined weight, then holds. Through the seam you call to Myra.\n\nA single, sharp **knock** answers—too close to be from anywhere but the inside face of the door.\n\nThe space behind the door shifts at once: a scuff of shoes, a wet inhale, and a muffled grunt like someone just got pulled by the collar. Rook’s voice goes tight, low, meant for whoever’s with him more than for you. “No—leave her—”\n\nSorn pivots as you order, camera tracking to the access panel behind you. The panel’s bottom edge bows outward—just a hair—then a fingernail of darkness opens as the latch finally gives. Cold air spills out of it, carrying that brine-and-oil tang stronger, like a lung exhaling.\n\nYour Vex (the one you’re warning) does exactly what you told him: he backs a half-step to keep the panel and corridor in frame, throat already primed.\n\nFrom inside the wall, something scrapes forward—metal on metal—then stops, as if whoever’s in the service chase heard Sorn’s camera reposition and froze.\n\nDown the corridor, the sweep-vest officers shift their stance when they hear the knock and see the panel move. One of them radios quietly, but you catch a fragment: “Kint liaison confirmed… breach risk…”\n\nThe corridor feels narrower now—door in front, panel behind—lights buzzing overhead, and the building’s ventilation carrying a thin, high whistle like it’s pulling air from somewhere it shouldn’t.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES**\n- Vex ID briefly shown on camera  \n- Myra signaled: being moved  \n- Access panel: cracked open  \n- Movement in service chase detected"

If someone comes through, you stop them, you don’t disappear with them.”  \n\nInto my phone, fast: “Control—active breach attempt via service chase behind FILES/Compliance door, Myra Venn signaled she’s being moved. Treat as unlawful detention in progress; send supervisor to this exact corridor and dispatch units to seal Pump House Annex intake endpoints.”  \n\nThen through the seam, low and urgent: “Myra—stay loud if you can.

Service access panel behind FILES/Compliance—partially opened. Officer Calder reporting attempted bypass. Observed movement in chase—metal scrape, then stop.”\n\nThe sweep-vest officer you point at hesitates—eyes flicking to Vex’s coat, then to Sorn’s camera. Your insistence on hands visible and “don’t disappear with them” hits a nerve. He steps over to the panel side, palms out where the lens can see them. “I’m not— I’m standing. I’m standing,” he mutters, like he’s trying to convince himself as much as you.\n\nYour call to Control goes through clean. This time the voice on the other end doesn’t sound bored—it sounds scared of being on the wrong side of the record. “Copy, Calder. Supervisor en route. Units sealing Pump House Annex intake endpoints now. Maintain visual. Do not enter confined service spaces.”\n\nThe access panel flexes again. A hand appears—gloved, work-worn—fingers hooking the edge to pull it wider. Sorn’s narration tightens: “Hand visible in chase—glove, dark cuff—attempting to open—” The sweep-vest officer flinches but holds position, blocking the opening with his body angle without actually touching the hand.\n\nFrom inside FILES/Compliance, Myra makes a sound—half gasp, half shout—then the dull thud of a shoulder or hip hitting the door from the other side. Not a full kick, but a desperate confirmation she’s still close enough to fight.\n\nRook’s voice cuts through the seam, sharp and furious now, aimed inward: “Stop—she stays quiet. We’re not—” The rest is swallowed by a scuffle, fabric rasping, and something hard clacking against metal—like a keyring or a stamp kit dropped.\n\nThe corridor’s air turns colder as the panel gap widens a fraction; it smells like wet concrete and brine, like the building’s guts have been rinsed with harbor water.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES**\n- Control: supervisor + units dispatched  \n- Sorn: panel filmed, narrated  \n- Panel: gloved hand visible  \n- Myra: impact on door heard"

He angles his shoulder closer—hands up, body in the way—making himself an awkward human plug. Vex watches him do it with a tight, assessing stare, like he’s deciding whether this officer is a liability or a witness.\n\nYou’re still braced at the FILES/Compliance door—your shoulder and Harlan’s pressing into cold metal that vibrates faintly with the scuffle on the other side. The air here tastes like disinfectant cut with harbor brine, and the strip of light under the door flickers as feet shift inside.\n\nAt your demand, there’s a beat of silence—then Rook, right up against the seam, voice low and furious but controlled for the cameras outside. “Calder—she’s not kidnapped. She’s… being secured. There’s an intake corridor behind this room and someone’s trying to pull her through it.” He pauses, then adds, like it costs him: “That’s not me.”\n\nA shape moves into the seam’s shadow from inside. Myra’s fingers appear first—two hands, shaking, palms splayed where the crack allows. Her nails are ink-stained; there’s a smear of black on her knuckle like she struck metal. She forces her voice through, ragged: “Rafe—he’s—” Something yanks her back; her fingertips scrape the door edge, leaving a dark streak.\n\nRook snaps, louder, to whoever’s inside with him: “Stop dragging her—now.” The scuffle shifts away from the door a step, and you hear a hard, wet cough like someone got the wind knocked out of them.\n\nBehind you, the access panel hand withdraws a fraction, not retreating—**repositioning**, as if the person in the chase is preparing to shove or to slip something through instead of coming out. The building’s ductwork gives another soft scrape overhead, moving parallel to the corridor.\n\nTime pressure tightens: Control said units are sealing the Pump House Annex endpoints—if the person in the chase realizes that, they may try to force this panel *now* before they’re trapped between sealed intakes and cameras.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES**\n- Panel hand: froze, then repositioned  \n- Myra: hands shown, yanked back  \n- Rook: admits intake corridor threat  \n- Scuffle: shifted away from door"

No disappearing acts.”  \n\nThen I raise my voice through the seam. “Rook—prove it’s ‘not you.’ Put Myra back to the seam and slide her ID badge or phone under the door.
