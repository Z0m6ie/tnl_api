He watches for hair-thin lines inside the metal and counts each flicker like a footstep.\n\nThe lamp listens. It leans its light toward the charm, not the street. The fog tastes of burnt wick and sugared rot, stronger now. Eldrin hears water where no gutter runs, and the sound climbs uphill.\n\nA lamplighter rounds the corner. He wears a dark coat with the Wickward Guild badge, the lantern-keepers who sell “safe routes.” He keeps his hands empty and his smile small. He stops under the listening glow and lifts a rumor-card to the flame.\n\nThe card curls but does not burn. It laughs once, quiet. The lamp answers with a deeper hum that bruises the air.\n\nLines bloom inside Eldrin’s charm. They form an alley where brick should sit flat. The mortar seam shines pale, then opens into a thin, moon-sour slit.\n\nThe chimes ring his name one syllable late.\n\nThe lamplighter looks past Eldrin and nods at the new gap. “There you are,” he says, like he found a dropped coin.\n\nFrom inside the slit, someone giggles with a closed mouth.

But you and your brass moth keep making the same mistakes in the same places.”\n\nHe holds the rumor-card closer to you, letting you see the ink as it ripples in the heat.

He sells ‘route-jokes’ to apprentices. But when he bottles—” his eyes flick to the barrel’s answering rings “—he goes under the **Old Tallow Press**, near the drainage runnels.

Your four faint taps land on the stone jamb like dry insects. The three-note knock that had been threading the air **breaks**—not silenced, but forced to hesitate, as if it lost its place in a song.\n\nYou lean to the crack.\n\n**Sensory grounding:** you’re on the ash-steps’ right side, shoulder near the kiln shed; the ajar door leaks a thin stripe of orange-gray heat-light onto the soot.\n\nInside, you catch **glass clink**—careful, deliberate—followed by the soft hiss of a stopper being seated. Clove-smoke is stronger here, but it’s been burned too hot, sharp at the back of your throat. Under it, that wet-paper sap-ink scent persists, like a legal document left too close to flame.\n\nA voice answers your presence without fully committing to speech—someone trying not to be overheard: “—heard three, got four. Not Guild code.” A pause. Then, closer to the crack: “Say the word.”\n\nYou whisper, barely breath: “Runner?”\n\nFor a heartbeat, silence. Then the chain inside gives a single **settling clink**, and the voice murmurs, “Moth?”—not quite your name, but shaped like it.\n\nYou ready the moth-charm under your coat like a blindfold. It warms against your ribs, not lighting—just **drinking sound**, dulling the edges of that almost-name so it doesn’t hook properly in the air. The three-note knock outside doesn’t find you again; it slides off into the lane like a dropped tune.\n\nThe lamplighter shifts behind you, tense. He mouths: “If they bottle in there, don’t let them see my lamp. It’ll… answer.”\n\nFrom uphill, the patrol’s boots scrape near the market fence. A muted lantern-hush swells and then tightens, as if they’re listening for exactly the kind of small, human mistake you’re refusing to make.\n\nThe kiln door crack widens a hair from the inside—just enough for an eye-line. You don’t see the eye, only the glint of something like **a lens** held close, and a soft, amused exhale. “One question,” the voice says. “Are you being followed by light, or by law?”\n\n**Status updates:**\n- Kiln shed: occupied, cautious voice\n- Moth-charm: muffling near-name hook\n- Patrol: at fence line, listening close",

Not joy. The Hollow’s surplus—what leaks off safe routes when the lamps drink too deep.” Another careful inhale. “Clove keeps the bottle from learning your breath.”\n\nAt your second question—*who taught you my almost-name*—the lens shifts, catching the kiln’s heat-light in a thin crescent. “The trees,” they say, and there’s a bitterness under it. “Cartouche Court scribes came through the sheds two nights ago with sap-ink and a polite warrant. They asked for ‘Moth’ like they were asking directions.

He mouths, barely: “Court’s been writing on people. Knew it.”\n\nInside the kiln shed, chain links drag once—someone shifting a crate or a hooked bar. The voice lowers further. “If you’re carrying a charm that eats names, keep it fed. They’ve got a listening lamp up there, and a bark-writ waiting to certify you into absence.”\n\nA pause, then a small, practical offer wrapped in fear: “I can slide you one bottle—unmarked.

Your boots find the same root-ridges the hauler used; your palms press damp bark that feels like cold leather over bone. The soft moss you avoid stirs anyway, offended, as if it wanted your weight.\n\nAt the tightest bend, you angle your eyes and read without staring.

They don’t speak, but their shoulders go tight with recognition—*they’ve seen this before*.\n\nBehind you, the lamplighter’s shuttered lantern gives a small, hungry *tick* at the soundless shape of your real name. He mutters, almost reverent, “That’s Court-work… or Court-fear.” Then, quieter: “If you keep wearing ‘Hobb,’ don’t wear it long. Names left on bark come back wrong.”\n\nSomewhere upslope, the listening-lantern hush bruises the air again—closer, searching. You’re through the tightest bend now, but the ink-shadow still tries to lick at your heels like a clerk’s quill testing wet wax.\n\n**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re just inside the tree-gate, downslope and slightly east of the kiln-fence line; fog beads on your lashes, and the bark smells of sap and old paper.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES**\n- Tree-gate crossed under “Hobb”\n- Cartouches: “name owed” marked\n- Moth-outline bypass revealed\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Tree-gate threshold (inside)\"],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

A shuttered lantern-beam needles the fog, searching for the *sound* of a name being spoken.

Your fingers find purchase in crooks that feel pre-made for hands.\n\nThe lamplighter follows tight, and when you hit him with the question—*who would bottle laughter under E.V.?*—he flinches like you slapped his lantern. “Foreman Morrow signs Guild debts with his own stamp,” he whispers, climbing. “But *tallymen* mark collections with initials—so the blame can walk away if the bottle breaks.” He glances back through the gap, voice turning smaller. “There’s one who’d do it neat. Hush Brine. Measures mouths. Loves clean letters. He’s been asking after ‘Moth’—said it like it was a wick he wanted to pinch.”\n\nAs you crest the first bend of the bypass, you see why the Court hates it: the cartouches thin out up here, and the tree’s “legal ink” can’t quite reach. But something else can—threads of fog snag on unseen hooks, forming a faint face-shape that smiles without opening.\n\nBelow, the searching hush pauses at the gate’s throat. The listening lantern lingers, confused, then swings away—yet the air stays tense, as if it left a question hanging.\n\nThe hauler, ahead of you now, presses a palm to their chest twice—*thank you*—then points upslope toward a darker seam where the bypass rejoins the interior path, away from the official bend.\n\n**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re midway up the right-trunk bypass, above the chime ring; west and downslope, the lantern-hush combs the fog just outside the tree-gate.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES**\n- Bypass engaged; chime ring stilled  \n- Wickward watcher name surfaced: Hush Brine  \n- Search-lantern passed without catching you  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Unwritten bypass (right-trunk shoulder)\"],\"npcs_add\":[\"Wickward Tallyman 'Hush' Brine (mentioned)\"]}\n```",

A lamp turned away at the right moment.” He swallows. “And sometimes… he trades *someone else’s* laugh. If he can tag it to your initials, the lamp doesn’t care whose throat it came from.”\n\nThe hauler freezes when you address them. Then—slowly—they nod once. Their hands move in a practiced, ashamed little language: two fingers to their mouth (laugh), then pinched shut (taken), then they tap the side of their head and drag the gesture outward like pulling thread from a spool.\n\nThe lamplighter watches, translating in a whisper. “He took their **directions**. The way their mind finds a place.

Something older that starts the same way your nickname does, but isn’t it.\n\nThe lamplighter’s throat clicks. “That’s not a person’s name,” he murmurs. “That’s a **path-title**.

They can follow marks—so long as the mark is anchored to something that can be *touched*.

Mist gathers at the trunk’s base and drifts—not forward like a road, but in a *sequence of bends*: a hard right that feels like stepping around a listening post, a long shallow left that hugs something warm, then a sudden back-step kink that doubles you behind your own footsteps. You can copy it as a shape: **right—long left—back-kink—straight through**.

He blinks at *names* more than threats. He came up tallying laughs off rumor-cards—still thinks superstition is just ink with better posture.” He nods at your knife. “Tell him a story where a lantern-maker marked a lamp with a moth and it listened too well. Tell him the moth-marked lamps started bruising the air and learning *who* was lying. He’ll look away first—he hates anything that suggests the lamps have opinions.”\n\nHe angles his chin toward the wickwalk seam you just learned to see. “Keep to the wick-cord that’s *frayed*—the lamps don’t like to listen to what’s already unraveling. Don’t step on the neat, freshly tarred stitches. Those are Brine’s ears.”\n\nAs you pass, one nearby lantern gives a tiny, hungry *inhale*—and the clove-wrapped unmarked laugh-bottle in your pocket warms, as if it’s being noticed.\n\n**Status updates:**  \n- Route-shape learned: right–left–back-kink–straight  \n- Wickwalk “fresh stitches”: listening risk  \n- Nearby lamp: attention rising",

The lamplighter mirrors you without being told—cheeks hollowed, eyes wide—and the hauler, bless their bundled silence, keeps trudging as if breath is a luxury.\n\nYour map-knife rides the tar seam. At first it’s just drag and grit. Then—halfway through the back-kink—there’s a change: a thin, high *keening* through the metal, like glass about to sing. Not a chime that recognizes you; a chime that’s deciding whether you’re worth remembering. The pitch rises when your blade crosses a neat, freshly tarred stitch; it drops when you return to fray. That tells you where the “ears” are embedded: the clean seams.\n\nAhead and slightly downhill, the wickwalk dips into a recess between two soot-wet retaining walls. The air there smells different: lamp-oil gone sour, paper that’s been breathed on too many times, and a faint metallic sweetness—coin-sweat, or old blood, or both.\n\nThe lamplighter answers your murmured question without using the tallyman’s name. “Counting-niche is a bite taken out of the wall. One lantern bolted above it, hooded like it’s ashamed. Smells like hot tar, damp ledger, and clove when he’s been paid.” His gaze flicks to your coat, then away. “He keeps cards—rumor-cards, stamped. Ledgers too, but the cards are what he *touches*. Teeth?” A humorless exhale. “Only when he smiles. Don’t make him smile.”\n\nAs you near the recess, you catch another thread: a soft, rhythmic scratch-scratch from inside the niche, like a quill tallying without ink—someone is already counting, or pretending to.\n\n**Status updates:**  \n- Laugh-bottle: heat muffled  \n- Listening seams identified: neat tar stitches  \n- Counting-niche: close; occupied (scratching)",

Not borrowed. Not a story you tell yourself to be brave. A lamp can taste the difference.”\n\nYou feel the definition land in your ribs: fresh fear is the kind that changes your breathing without permission.\n\n“Memory-fear?” it continues. “Only if it’s still *alive* in you—if the remembering makes your hands sweat now. Borrowed fear is thin. Staged fear is sugar; the lamp gets hungrier after.”\n\nAs you inch a half-step sideways along the frayed cord, staying off the neat tar, your angle on the hooded lantern improves. The seam is clearer: black-lacquered bark-paper fitted under the hood’s rim. And there—just where iron should be riveted—there’s a **tongue-leather lip** peeking out, like a drawer-edge tucked too far in. No obvious latch, but the leather has a **bite-mark notch**, as if someone opens it with a tooth or a hooked nail rather than a key.\n\nThe lamplighter hears your murmur and gives a tight nod without looking up. “Same shape,” he agrees. “Right, long left, back-kink—then we’re gone.” He shifts his weight so his body blocks you from the west a little more.\n\nBecause the Guild light *does* shift: not closer, but *taller*, as if someone lifted a lantern higher to see over a shoulder. The listening glow thins into a beam that probes the alley-mouth.\n\nThe hauler, newly strapped, freezes hard—bundle hugged like a shield. From the trees above, a pale cartouche re-inks around that not-quite-anyone shadow again, and the hooded lantern gives a tiny, involuntary tremor, as if it’s trying not to repeat something it just heard.\n\nThe borrower lowers its voice. “If you feed it fear, choose a fear that ends. A fear with a door. Otherwise the lamp keeps the taste and follows you.”\n\n**Status updates:**  \n- Hood seam detail: tongue-leather lip  \n- Guild lantern-beam: probing west mouth  \n- Fresh fear clarified: first-hand only",

Your hissed orders carry: the lamplighter drops his gaze; the hauler’s hum starts up, muffled through cloth like a saw behind a wall.\n\n**Immediate outcome:** steering wide of the root-bolted listening-lantern helps. Its glass seems to *lean* toward your footfalls, trying to drink the shape of them, but you keep to the stone-sweat edge where the cold slickness smears prints into nothing. The sap-smeared pebble rolls hard around the kink and clacks twice—then skids—leaving a bright, readable smear-line that the Court’s lantern-beam immediately prefers. It’s a convincing decoy trace, because it carries the same glossy “seal” you stamped into the cartouche.\n\nYou’re now just past the kink: to your right, the root-lantern hangs like a patient ear; to your left, stone sweats in beads that smell faintly of burnt wick and pennies. Behind, the bent trunks’ cartouches continue rewriting, but your group’s shadows have already slipped beyond their easy pinning.\n\nAlder-in-Ash doesn’t answer at once. You hear the small shift of their boots as they re-aim, and their voice comes measured—careful not to become “repeatable instruction.” “I will not swear a way out,” they call back. “Sworn directions become public record, and public record becomes binding.”\n\nThen, a concession, almost kind: “Stone-sweat north is **less readable**. The root-lantern is **more merciful**—and more loyal. It reports.”\n\nAt the same moment, the Hush-Hound pauses at the kink. Its rib-chimes go still, listening for the “true” you among the false. It noses toward the sap-bright pebble trail, tempted.\n\nThe lamplighter leans close to you, whisper-hot: “He’s telling you the truth in Court-words. ‘Less readable’ is the closest you’ll get to safe.”\n\n**Status updates**\n- Cartouche “ruling”: disrupted by blindfold  \n- Root listening-lantern: avoided, still attentive  \n- Sap-pebble decoy: drawing Court beam  \n- Hush-Hound: hesitating at kink",

Safe. You nick it with a pale chalk-scratch from your knife-hand. The next stone answers a fraction late—hollowed diagonal—so you don’t mark it; you shift your weight to the first nicked one and keep the file tight. The seam’s center thickens and slides beside you like milk in a tilted bowl, but it doesn’t catch.\n\nTo your rear-left, Nail Jun’s shuttered amber glow bobs once, then steadies. They speak quietly, eyes on your nicks more than your face. “Hush Brine goes where lamps go dim on purpose,” they say. “Under the Lantern-maker’s Quarter—behind the listening lamp by the iron gate, where the wick-smoke clings to brick like a confession.” Jun’s fingers keep “mending” an invisible wick as they talk. “If a debt won’t collect clean, Brine trades it sideways.

One you have not sold. Say it, and I’ll show you the bruise-lantern’s door. Refuse, and you’ll keep laughing around the missing piece forever.”\n\nNail Jun flinches at that—small, controlled. “Don’t bargain with stray chimes,” they mutter, but there’s uncertainty under the authority. Their lantern shutter tightens again, as if trying to keep the light from overhearing your answer.\n\nThe rim ahead sweats cold; your chalk nicks form a thin, readable spine along the leftward skirt.

Not wood. Stone, maybe. And—Eldrin—there’s a second thing: a listening lantern *beyond* it. Farther in. Like it wants to be noticed.” They swallow, forcing their breath to stay off-kilter with yours. “Also—someone’s been here. Foot-scuffs in the grit on the other side. Recent.”\n\n**Multiple active threads:** the scratch-writing on the curtain keeps *trying* to complete itself into proper cartouche script (it hesitates every time your breath stutters); from deeper in, a distant chime rings one syllable late—close enough to be a lure; and behind, the fog seam’s chuckle thickens, as if it’s pressing up the alley to see whether you commit.\n\n**Environmental context:** the longer you hover in the threshold, the more the curtain behaves like a clerk with a pen—patient, persistent, eager to “file” you.\n\n**Status updates:**  \n- Door: showing mile-marker glyph  \n- Cartouche-ink scent: present  \n- Foot-scuffs: recent, beyond  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Out-side threshold (mile-marker ahead)\"],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

The air on this side is colder and tastes faintly of sugared rot. Behind you, where the moth-and-arrow had been crisp, you drag your fingers through the chalk: the symbol collapses into a rough, wing-shaped smear with a deliberate tail. The curtain gives a tiny, offended *tch*—not a voice, more like a pen cap snapping shut.\n\nTo your left (northward), the ground slopes up in a way stone shouldn’t. Ahead, maybe thirty paces, the **stone mile-marker** rises from moss-slick flagging like a tooth. Farther beyond it—off to the right, half-buried in fog—something lantern-shaped sits at waist height, the air around it bruised darker, as if it’s listening hard.\n\nJun stays tight behind you, lantern shutter down like you asked. They don’t look up. “Ground first,” they whisper back, and you feel them match your double-tap rhythm—slightly delayed at first, then syncing.\n\nCrouched, you read the scuffs: **two sets**. One is light and quick—small steps, toe-heavy, someone trying not to leave a story. The other is heavier, heel-first, with a faint drag on the right side as if the boot sole is torn or the wearer favors a leg. Both sets angle **toward the mile-marker**, then break: the lighter set veers wide around it; the heavier goes straight up to it and stops.\n\nWhen you murmur, “No filing—only passage,” the air tightens. The scratch-writing you heard before doesn’t return; instead, a thin film of moisture on the stones near your smeared mark briefly beads into **almost-letters**—then your uneven breathing ruins their alignment and they collapse back into ordinary damp.\n\nJun lifts two fingers and points without raising their gaze. “There’s grit piled at the base of the marker,” they say. “Like someone scraped mud off there. And—Moth—listen.” A distant chime rings again, one syllable late… but closer now, as if it’s walking toward your heartbeat rather than your ears.\n\n**Environmental context:** lingering too long near the mile-marker feels like standing at a clerk’s desk: the fog stills, waiting for you to “state your business.” The listening lantern’s presence presses at the edge of your attention, trying to make eye-contact without eyes.\n\n**Status updates:**  \n- Threshold mark: blurred, usable  \n- Tracks: two sets, recent  \n- Chime: drawing nearer",

The stone there is slick with cold sweat; your stomp-and-skip rhythm splashes dark beads that don’t fall straight—they hesitate, then slide *uphill* a finger’s width before surrendering to gravity. You refuse every chime-beat, even when it lands perfectly on your heel.\n\nJun runs on your left shoulder, breath sawing. “Good—good—don’t answer it,” they rasp, and you hear real fear under the training. “If you answer, it *pins* you. Nails you to a count.” As you clear the wet patch, Jun’s sleeve brushes yours and you feel them flinch like they touched a hot wire. “Fog’s right behind—closer than before.”\n\nThe chime-note behind you turns ugly, no longer hunting—**accusing**, as if you broke a contract. In the corner of your hearing, a second, fainter chime joins in from ahead-right, a delayed echo that suggests there’s another hanger nearby… or the first is bouncing off something hollow.\n\nJust past the wet stone, the seam becomes dry again, but narrower, squeezed between two leaning trunks whose bark is crowded with half-erased cartouches. Between those trunks, a listening-lantern glow (not a lantern you can see—more like amber attention in the air) **tilts toward you**, bruising the fog into a denser outline for an instant.\n\n**Environmental pressure:** the tree-root you scarred will be “reported” in the Court’s language—damaged cartouches draw attention. The chimes are trying to reassert a shared rhythm; your chaos is protection, but it’s loud protection.\n\n**Status updates:**\n- Cartouche: smeared, unreadable  \n- Fog: momentarily lost, then closer  \n- Chimes: accusatory, echoing ahead",

The air between them is drier—papery—while to the ahead-right the echoing chime-note comes from a shallow dip where the ground drops like a swallowed breath.\n\nJun keeps their back half-turned, eyes flicking between the trunks and the fog. “Half-erased cartouches do both,” they say, voice tight. “Erase if you match the Court’s wording—if you let it *finish you*. Hide if you stay unfiled. People who survive here learn to be… grammatically wrong.”\n\nAs you peer without staring, you catch it: a **tiny comma-shaped scar** in the bark on the left trunk, only visible from the corner of your eye. It smells like old paper and fresh sap. And the nearest chime—somewhere not far—rings **one beat late**, as if apologizing after the fact. The comma-scar points—not like an arrow, more like a suggestion—toward the ahead-right dip.\n\nJun follows your tilt toward the echo. “Second chime isn’t a hanger,” they whisper. “It’s a hollow. Sound’s bouncing off a pocket—like a throat-cleft. We can duck in, but hollows have rules. They make you… *agree* to things without saying yes.”\n\nBetween the leaning trunks, the bark-scripts subtly rearrange—pale strokes tightening around the space you’re standing in, eager to become a sentence with you inside it.

A thin runnel of water is there—moving uphill with quiet, rude insistence—threading between stones like it’s trying to leave.\n\nJun follows tight, keeping their breath inside their mouth. “Broken grammar,” they echo, like they’re holding the idea between their teeth. “Good.

It’s testing whether you’ll give it a clean “yes” to hang you from.\n\nJun answers first, fast and ugly, exactly as you coached: “Yeh—no—if—when. Wasn’t. Mightn’t. Who’s asking?” Their eyes stay down, jaw clenched.\n\nThe hollow shivers, displeased. The uphill water-runner chuckles once—quietly—like it enjoyed Jun’s refusal.\n\n**Environmental context:** the cleft buys concealment and slows the fog, but it tries to *regularize* sound; if your rhythm becomes orderly or your words become affirmative, it can “seat” you here like a clause that can’t end.\n\n**Status updates:**  \n- Leaning trunks: pursuit slowed  \n- Throat-cleft: sound re-orders steps  \n- Hollow: probing for agreement",

The water gathers there, trembling, and slips into a hairline crack that shouldn’t take more than a bead at a time. It takes it anyway, greedily.\n\nJun keeps moving in ugly half-steps, resisting the hollow’s urge to turn them into a metronome.

It’s a **narrow ledge**, just enough for the ball of your foot, and it runs down in a shallow spiral like a throat’s inner ridge. The wrapped chime stays dead under your forearm; no jingle leaks.\n\nYour whisper to Jun lands dangerously close to a complete instruction, and the space *tries* to finish it for you—air tugging at the last word like a hooked finger. Jun snaps their teeth shut and answers with a broken, useless fragment: “Drop—*drip*—drift,” ruining the cadence. The tug eases, but not all the way.\n\nYou tap the wall once, off-time. The throat-space replies with a **delayed, mismatched echo**: not a clean reflection, but a second tap that arrives half a heartbeat late and slightly *higher*, like someone imitating you through thin metal.\n\nThat answering chime isn’t far. By the way the echo “bends,” it’s **below and to your left** (south-left in the spiral), tucked behind a thicker patch of laminate—likely another niche or a side pocket. And beneath that, you catch a faint, steady **lamp-hum**—the kind that comes from a Wickward listening lantern working hard.\n\n**Sensory grounding:** You’re partway down the downward pocket now, one shoulder brushing resin-slick wall; above and behind (west/up), the slit-mouth is a dim oval with fog pressing at its edge like wet cloth.\n\nJun follows, slow as you asked, one hand splayed against the wall. They keep their breathing deliberately ugly, then whisper through clenched jaw, “Guild doesn’t hang one. They hang… *strings*. If you hear two, there’s a third that listens.”\n\nAs if to prove it, the air above the slit-mouth tightens again—listening attention narrowing on the little *pop* you made earlier, now triangulating. It can’t see you, but it’s learning the shape of your silence.\n\n**Environmental context:** The ledge is stable but slick; a misstep will slide you down faster than you intend. The “answering” chime and lamp-hum suggest a monitored route ahead—quiet movement helps, but the network seems built to notice patterns, not just volume.\n\n**Status updates:**  \n- Ledge found: spiral descent  \n- Answering chime: below-left, close  \n- Listening outside: narrowing search",

As you near it, the chuckle shifts half a tone, almost as if it’s trying to match your breathing and failing on purpose.\n\nJun follows close, eyes up, one hand hovering near their own throat like they’re feeling for their pulse. “If it gets hungry,” they murmur back, “it’ll offer you a ‘safe route’ in a voice you recognize. Don’t answer it.”\n\nThe clove-waxed flap behind you stays shut—but the muffled hum inside begins to *work* against the clog, a patient grinding like an ear clearing itself.\n\n**Status updates:**\n- Listener flap: gummed, muffled\n- Tag stamp read: H. Brine\n- Moving toward: uphill tin-runnel",

Your eyes pick up the workmanship fast: the rivets are too regular for scavenged repair, and the seams have been **recently re-crimped**—bright metal bruised under a tool, then rubbed dull with soot to look old.\n\nNear the third rivet from the bend, you find what you were looking for: a **wick-scratch glyph**—not a tally this time, but a tiny hooked loop, the same “eyelash” mark you saw under **H. BRINE**. Someone signed the *sound* as well as the paper.\n\nYou dip two fingers into the uphill stream. It’s cold enough to sting, and it vibrates faintly—like a throat humming behind a door. You flick droplets ahead onto the stone.\n\nImmediate result: the droplets **do not follow** the runnel’s obedient laugh. They skitter, hesitate… then most of them **roll downhill** in the natural direction, silent and ordinary. Two beads, though, catch on an invisible “line” in the air and crawl **sideways** toward a hairline gap between stones—a hidden grate seam no wider than paper. The chuckle you’ve been tracking isn’t the water’s joy at all; it’s being **thrown** through that gap, vented like breath.\n\nAs you register that, the sound shifts—cleaner, closer—and for a moment it syncs with your chest. Your heartbeat answers it without permission, loud in your ears, like someone turned you into a drum.\n\nJun, behind and slightly upslope, goes very still. When you ask about Hush Brine, their reply comes tight and quick, as if they don’t want the fog to learn the shape of it. “He didn’t cross me. He *counted* me. Brine tallies favors before you know you owe them. If he stamps your ink-dialect on a debt-tag, he can say you agreed to the route—then the lamps get to call you ‘late.’”\n\nThe fog around the grate seam seems to thin, as if lips parting.\n\nYour own pulse starts to **amplify**, drowning out small sounds—the chime, Jun’s breath, even the runnel’s rattle—leaving one laughing corridor of noise that tries to make “uphill” feel like the only true direction.\n\n**Status updates:**  \n- Runnel rigging confirmed: recent toolwork  \n- Hidden sound-vent located: hairline grate seam  \n- Resonance rising: heartbeat syncing",

Stone sweats cold against your knuckles. You pry just enough to make a slit—messy, irregular pressure—while your other hand smears clove-wax across the vent lip in a blotchy crescent.

Wedged inside, you glimpse a little bundle: **bone-dust packed in wax** around a thin reed of cracked glass—more Choir craft than Guild, but set with Guild rivets. Cooperation, or theft.\n\nAs you hold the seam open, a faint, delayed chime-note arrives from upslope—your planted marker answering something you can’t see. Not footsteps; a careful repositioning.

Three nights ago, in the graveyard behind the lantern-maker’s quarter, the charm warmed in his palm and “lit” a route no street has ever admitted to having: a thin, moon-sour alley that opens into Laughing Hollow like a throat clearing.\n\nHe followed it long enough to sketch five landmarks that should not coexist: an uphill brook giggling through reeds of glass; a court-tree whose cartouches re-ink themselves around your shadow; a wind-chime that rings *your name* one syllable late; a lantern that listens so hard it bruises the air; and a mile-marker carved with Eldrin’s own handwriting—dated next week.\n\nNow the Wickward Guild wants him found, politely at first. Their lamplighters have begun stopping travelers and holding his old rumor-cards up to the flame, asking who “Moth” sold a certain joke to. Someone has been bottling laughter in his name, and the lamps fed on it are starting to hunger.\n\nThe Cartouche Court has issued a soft summons: bring the charm for “authentication.” Their bark-scribes insist his map is illegal not because it’s false, but because it’s *unaligned*—and the trees have begun erasing anyone who repeats his directions aloud.\n\nAnd the Chimebone Choir has left him a melody, tapped into his doorframe with bone dust: a heartbeat-key that matches the charm’s hidden lines. It offers guidance… and threatens to open something that has been smiling with its mouth shut."

He watches for hair-thin lines inside the metal and counts each flicker like a footstep.\n\nThe lamp listens. It leans its light toward the charm, not the street. The fog tastes of burnt wick and sugared rot, stronger now. Eldrin hears water where no gutter runs, and the sound climbs uphill.\n\nA lamplighter rounds the corner. He wears a dark coat with the Wickward Guild badge, the lantern-keepers who sell “safe routes.” He keeps his hands empty and his smile small. He stops under the listening glow and lifts a rumor-card to the flame.\n\nThe card curls but does not burn. It laughs once, quiet. The lamp answers with a deeper hum that bruises the air.\n\nLines bloom inside Eldrin’s charm. They form an alley where brick should sit flat. The mortar seam shines pale, then opens into a thin, moon-sour slit.\n\nThe chimes ring his name one syllable late.\n\nThe lamplighter looks past Eldrin and nods at the new gap. “There you are,” he says, like he found a dropped coin.\n\nFrom inside the slit, someone giggles with a closed mouth. The lamp brightens and tugs its light toward it."

      "Lantern-keepers called the **Wickward Guild** patrol the listening glow, mending streetlights and selling “safe routes,” yet they secretly bottle the Hollow’s laughter to power ever-hungrier lamps. The **Cartouche Court**—bark-scribes and polite litigants—offers free wayfinding and arbitration of trail-rights, while covertly rewriting the trees’ pale glyphs to erase rival memories and crown a single “true” path. Meanwhile the **Chimebone Choir** wanders as mournful musicians who soothe fear with iron-and-bone melodies, but their hidden work is tuning heartbeats into a key that opens the Hollow’s throat. The Guild hires the Court to legitimize maps; the Court prosecutes the Choir as “noise-criminals”; the Choir sabotages lanterns, making every “safe route” end in a joke.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"factions\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"The Wickward Guild\",\n      \"public_front\": \"Lantern-keepers who repair lights, sell safe routes, and keep travelers from vanishing.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Harvests and bottles the Hollow’s laughter to fuel predatory lanterns and expand control over paths.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"The Cartouche Court\",\n      \"public_front\": \"Bark-scribes and judges who provide wayfinding, map authentication, and trail-right arbitration.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Rewrites living cartouches to delete memories, invalidate rival maps, and enthrone a single sanctioned ‘true’ route.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"The Chimebone Choir\",\n      \"public_front\": \"Wandering musicians who calm panic with wind-chime hymns and guide the lost by sound.\",\n      \"hidden_agenda\": \"Tunes heartbeats into a resonance that can unlock the Hollow’s ‘throat’ and bargain with what laughs inside.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```",

      "Eldrin “Moth” Vale’s newest map isn’t drawn on paper. It’s drawn on the *inside* of a moth-shaped charm—lantern-brass etched with hair-thin lines that only appear when the Hollow laughs. Three nights ago, in the graveyard behind the lantern-maker’s quarter, the charm warmed in his palm and “lit” a route no street has ever admitted to having: a thin, moon-sour alley that opens into Laughing Hollow like a throat clearing.\n\nHe followed it long enough to sketch five landmarks that should not coexist: an uphill brook giggling through reeds of glass; a court-tree whose cartouches re-ink themselves around your shadow; a wind-chime that rings *your name* one syllable late; a lantern that listens so hard it bruises the air; and a mile-marker carved with Eldrin’s own handwriting—dated next week.\n\nNow the Wickward Guild wants him found, politely at first. Their lamplighters have begun stopping travelers and holding his old rumor-cards up to the flame, asking who “Moth” sold a certain joke to. Someone has been bottling laughter in his name, and the lamps fed on it are starting to hunger.\n\nThe Cartouche Court has issued a soft summons: bring the charm for “authentication.” Their bark-scribes insist his map is illegal not because it’s false, but because it’s *unaligned*—and the trees have begun erasing anyone who repeats his directions aloud.\n\nAnd the Chimebone Choir has left him a melody, tapped into his doorframe with bone dust: a heartbeat-key that matches the charm’s hidden lines. It offers guidance… and threatens to open something that has been smiling with its mouth shut."

Wind-chimes hang from an iron gate with no fence. They tap bone against glass and miss the beat on purpose.\n\nEldrin “Moth” Vale kneels by the gate and holds a moth-shaped brass charm to the nearest lamp. He watches for hair-thin lines inside the metal and counts each flicker like a footstep.\n\nThe lamp listens. It leans its light toward the charm, not the street. The fog tastes of burnt wick and sugared rot, stronger now. Eldrin hears water where no gutter runs, and the sound climbs uphill.\n\nA lamplighter rounds the corner. He wears a dark coat with the Wickward Guild badge, the lantern-keepers who sell “safe routes.” He keeps his hands empty and his smile small. He stops under the listening glow and lifts a rumor-card to the flame.\n\nThe card curls but does not burn. It laughs once, quiet. The lamp answers with a deeper hum that bruises the air.\n\nLines bloom inside Eldrin’s charm. They form an alley where brick should sit flat. The mortar seam shines pale, then opens into a thin, moon-sour slit.\n\nThe chimes ring his name one syllable late.\n\nThe lamplighter looks past Eldrin and nods at the new gap. “There you are,” he says, like he found a dropped coin.\n\nFrom inside the slit, someone giggles with a closed mouth. The lamp brightens and tugs its light toward it."

The listening glow sharpens, and the charm in your palm warms hard enough to sting.\n\n“Expecting a *route*,” he answers, voice polite as oiled hinges. “Not a person. But you and your brass moth keep making the same mistakes in the same places.”\n\nHe holds the rumor-card closer to you, letting you see the ink as it ripples in the heat. It isn’t words so much as a *caption* that keeps trying to settle into legible shape: **MOTH SOLD THE JOKE THAT POWERS THE LAMPS.** Every time it almost resolves, it snickers and smears itself.\n\n“It told the flame what it wanted to hear,” the lamplighter says. “And the flame listened.

Good.”\n\n“Toll?” it says, tasting the word. “Naaames are easy. Light is bitter.” A pause like a grin being buttoned shut. “Stooories… keep.”\n\nThe listening lamp brightens at the mention of stories—hungry, almost eager.

A wick that learned to ask. It wants the part of a story where the door opens fast.” The seam’s edges wetly click, like teeth behind lips. “Trade accepted. No names. True.”\n\nThe lamplighter flinches at the word *accepted*. “Don’t—” he starts, then bites it off, wary of becoming a repeater himself. He answers your question anyway, low and clipped. “You fit where you always did: between routes. The Court hates you because your maps propagate. The Guild hates you because you make people walk without paying for ‘safe light.’”\n\nHe lifts the rumor-card a fraction, keeping it turned so *you* can see but not read aloud.

Then, quieter: “Nearest cut-through that isn’t a seam is the **wicker-run** behind the lamp-market stalls. Looks like a dead fence. It isn’t. You push where the wicker’s been patched with **copper wire**—that’s Guild work. It drops you into the ash-steps by the kiln sheds.”\n\nAs he speaks, his pinned lamp tremors again—subtle, hungry—drawn toward the idea of a “Guild cut-through.” Down the alley mouth, the patrol-lantern’s searching glow slows to a near-stop; you hear boot leather pause on wet stone, and the faint clink of a wick-tool being adjusted, like someone preparing to look *closer*.\n\nSomewhere farther off, the wind-chime tries your name-shape again—still one syllable late—testing whether you’ll answer. The barrel’s surface gives a tiny, involuntary twitch in the same rhythm, as if sound is making ripples without touching water.\n\n**Status updates:**\n- Barrel sign: **Two rings → Tallow Press**\n- Interference: **late third ring**\n- Cut-through learned: **wicker-run (copper patch)**\n- Patrol: **paused, listening**"

Your caution pays off: no running, no breathy name-sounds, no jangling tools.\n\nThe patrol chooses that moment to commit.

The stone is wet-cold against your cheek; the cartouche-ink smell of sap and old paper is stronger here, as if the trees’ legal scribbles have been rubbed into the masonry.\n\nThe lamplighter freezes with you, shoulder to shoulder. In the thin gap between his coat and his pinned lamp, you hear the lamp’s hush grow eager. He presses his forearm across it—muffling it hard. In a near-silent rasp he offers, “Good. Let them *think* we’re a crack in the wall.”\n\nThe patrol-lantern pauses ten paces away. You catch a fragment of their low talk: “—bottled laughter residue… Quarter stink—” and then the sound of a wick-tool scraping glass.

That gives you your gap.\n\nYou creep again. Ahead, the rear of the lamp-market shows as a sagging **wicker fence**, patched in places with twine and scrap. Your eyes pick out the tell: a fist-sized mend stitched with **copper wire**—too neat, too deliberate, catching even the weak ambient light with a dull penny gleam.\n\nThe lamplighter exhales through his nose only. “There,” he breathes without voice. “Push on the copper. Don’t pull.”\n\nBehind you, the patrol’s light shifts away from the barrel, dissatisfied, and begins to sweep back toward the wall—closer now, as if it’s realized the alley has *too few sounds*.\n\n**Status updates:**\n- Patrol: entered alley, sweeping closer  \n- Wicker-run: copper patch located  \n- Lamplighter lamp: fully muffled  \n- Moth-charm: warmth suppressed"

A thin runnel of water crawls along the curb—moving the wrong way for the slope, as if embarrassed to be seen.\n\nYou crouch and look back.\n\nThe wicker **re-seals** almost politely. The copper wire tightens on its own, drawing the patch flush until it looks like nothing more than an old mend. The only “tell” is subtler: a faint, fresh **penny-smear** on the copper where your palm pressed, and a slight change in weave direction that only someone already hunting that exact trick would notice.\n\nBehind the fence, the patrol-lantern’s glow washes across the alley, then pauses—close now. You hear a tool tap stone, and a voice mutter, “Too quiet. Quarter’s holding its breath.” The listening light lingers a heartbeat longer than comfort, but it doesn’t swing to the fence; it’s still distracted by the barrel’s earlier wrongness.\n\nThe lamplighter, breathing shallow, tucks his pinned lamp deeper and murmurs without shaping his lips much, “Good hands, Moth.

Too common to choke on.” His shuttered lantern gives a small, hungry *tick* at the name, like a tongue clicking.\n\nThe hauler points at your wrist, then makes a tiny “H” in the air—confirming. Then they demonstrate the approach with their feet: not straight at the gate, but *along the roots that climb the trunk*, weight kept off the inviting moss.

Between those trunks, a listening-lantern glow (not a lantern you can see—more like amber attention in the air) **tilts toward you**, bruising the fog into a denser outline for an instant.\n\n**Environmental pressure:** the tree-root you scarred will be “reported” in the Court’s language—damaged cartouches draw attention.

The almost-laugh in your throat buckles and goes down like a swallowed thorn.\n\nIn the thicker shadow just off the laughing runnel, you reel the cloth-wrapped chime by its cord. It slides across stone-sweat with a faint, reluctant *shhhk*—and the air around it tightens as if the Hollow had been holding that cord too. The bundled listener watches your hand, but doesn’t stop you; they watch upslope more.\n\nWhen you murmur Brine’s ledger-location, the bundled listener’s eyes widen a fraction—then flatten into something careful. “Bruised-blue,” they repeat under their breath, as if tasting a color. “So that’s where he keeps his ribs.” They tuck that truth away like a blade.\n\nUpslope, the fog-dent pacer shifts their stance toward you. The listening lanternlight there bruises the air amber, and for a heartbeat it feels like your words have weight—enough weight to roll downhill.\n\nThe bundled listener answers your question fast, like they’re trying to get it said before the light can learn it.\n\n“Under the brook: **Hollow-Nails don’t read you. They listen for the wrong beat.** Court-scribes read. They’ll make you repeat yourself.” A small jerk of their chin toward your chest. “If someone under there asks you to *say the route aloud*, that’s Court work. If they ask you to *tap it*—knuckle to stone, seven short—Hollow-Nails.”\n\nThey lean closer, voice almost inaudible. “Hollow-Nails carry **black thread** and keep their hands dirty with cullet dust. Court keeps their hands clean and their words sharp. Court will offer ‘authentication.’ Hollow-Nails will offer ‘quiet.’”\n\nA pause—then a warning with teeth. “And if the lamp gets hungry, don’t feed it laughter. Feed it **a lie that costs you**. Lamps like expensive lies. It keeps them chewing longer.”\n\nThe chime bundle is now fully in your shadow, cord looped around your fingers; it feels warmer than it should, like it’s been held recently.\n\n**Status updates**\n- Jun: pinch-signal established  \n- Chime bundle: retrieved into shadow  \n- Fog-dent pacer: attention fixed on you  \n- Brine’s ledgers: traded truth delivered  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}"

Good.\n\nThe bundled listener accepts your offer with a tilt of the head that’s almost formal. “Names are knives,” they breathe. “Bring yours sharp.” They don’t follow—yet—but you feel their attention stay on your back like a hand hovering near a pocket.\n\nYou drift downslope, angling away from the laughing runnel. The fog here is thicker and colder; it tastes less like sugar-rot and more like damp paper. To your left, the runnel’s giggle thins into a wet chuckle, and the chimes in the air retune to your heartbeat again—half a beat late, still trying to make you dance.\n\nThe cloth-wrapped chime bundle pressed to your ribs warms further, as if it recognizes motion. Through the cloth, something inside gives a tiny, sympathetic *tick*—not a ring, but a near-ring, like it’s swallowing its own sound.\n\nBehind you, upslope, the fog-dent pacer shifts to keep you in line-of-scent—then stops. Not because they lost you, but because they’ve found something else: the lanternlight bruises brighter once, and you hear a soft glassy scrape, like someone setting down a bottle carefully. A second presence joins them—footfalls too neat for the runnel stones. Court-neat.\n\nJun’s fingers brush your sleeve seam—warning by touch only—then point low: a darker crease in the fog-shadow that cuts toward the kiln-shed switchback route you know. It’s safer terrain, but it runs close to where Guild lamps “listen” hardest.\n\nAs you slide into that crease, the bundled listener’s voice carries once, barely. “Don’t let the lamp hear you *thinking* about the niche.”\n\nThe Hollow answers with silence that feels amused.\n\n**Status updates**\n- Pacer disengaged; new company arrived  \n- Retreat path: fog-crease toward switchback  \n- Chime bundle: warming, near-ringing  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Fog-crease (downslope line toward kiln-shed switchback)\"],\"npcs_add\":[\"Second presence (Court-neat footfalls, unseen)\"]}"

The near-ring becomes a muffled *thum* against your ribs. When you whisper, “Hush—later,” it answers: not a sound, but a faint vibration through the cloth, like a swallowed note trying to find the shape of your words. It settles after two heartbeats, obedient… or listening.\n\nDownslope, the fog tastes of wet paper and old wick. To your right (east), the laughing runnel is now just a thin, teasing burble; to your left (west), the stones rise into a low bank where cartouches on bark shift when you don’t look straight at them.\n\nUpslope, you angle your ear. The Court-neat footfalls are there—measured, careful not to slip—paired with a softer step that doesn’t care if it scuffs. Then: the bottle scrape again, very light, like glass kissed by a fingernail.\n\nJun freezes mid-step and points without speaking: upslope-left, where the fog bruises amber around a cracked lantern-post that leans at knee height. The post looks ordinary—soot, old wire, a split collar of iron—until the lanternlight *listens harder* and the soot begins to unspool.\n\nBright thread spills out of the post’s throat in a sudden, eager bloom—stitch-fine and luminous—snaking low across the stone toward the crease you’re using, hunting ankles by feel rather than sight. It moves like it already knows the shape of a leg.\n\nFrom upslope, a voice you can’t quite place—polite, tired—says to someone unseen, “Careful. The warden-skein’s awake.

When you underhand it downslope-right, it clicks twice on stone and then *plunks* into the laughing runnel.\n\nImmediate reaction: the skein whips its bright stitches toward the sound like a startled cat—fast, low, hungry. It pours across the crease and into the runnel’s shallow edge, stitching at the water’s surface as if trying to hem the giggle shut. The runnel answers with a louder chuckle and the thread shivers, confused by moving water.\n\nTo the west (upslope-left), the cracked lantern-post leans harder, listening. The amber bruise-light around it pulses once, then steadies—like it’s pleased you gave it something simple to chase.\n\nThe Court-neat presence steps closer into partial view through fog: not a face, but a sleeve and a gloved hand held open, palm out in a “peace” shape. A thin strip of pale bark-paper hangs from their other hand like a warrant that isn’t being read aloud. Their voice stays polite and tired. “Good. Still hands. Keep them where the lantern can see. The skein only bites what it thinks is fleeing.”\n\nBeside that voice, the softer-step companion shifts—Guild weight, Guild posture. You catch another tiny glass scrape, closer now, as if a bottle is being set down on stone with reverence.\n\nOn your bank, the cartouches in the bark at your fingertips re-ink around your shadow, tightening into little knot-shapes.
