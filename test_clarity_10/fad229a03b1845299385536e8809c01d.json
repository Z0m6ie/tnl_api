The air tastes of ionized metal and old incense. Your steps vanish into a hush, then return a beat late from somewhere behind you.\n\nYou stand at the base of a ribbed archway where the corridor widens like a chapel aisle. A Salvage Directorate shuttle waits sealed behind you, and your contract tag blinks green on your wrist. You keep your gloved thumb on a wafer-thin memory key you do not remember packing. It reads, in neat block letters: MERCY // DO NOT RUN ALONE.\n\nThe intercom clicks. It says your name in a voice you have never heard. It tries again. It cycles through three other names, fast, like it searches a file. The key warms against your skin and pulses with the ship’s distant chime. You lift it near the bulkhead. Frost on the nearest viewport fractures into a clean grid that matches no map you saw on the shuttle.\n\nYour comm pings with a maintenance code. The code carries the smell of your childhood hallway, sharp with floor polish. A second ping follows. It carries a laugh you buried years ago. Each ping ends with a subsystem ID stamped in cold text.\n\nYou wait for the Directorate escort to answer your channel. No one answers. The corridor lights dim one notch, then hold. The delayed echo of your last step stops returning.\n\nFootfalls start ahead of you. Soft. Bare. They keep time with the chime. The intercom breathes once, then speaks close, as if from the grille at your shoulder.\n\n“Don’t give it to them,” it says. “Elara is still here.”\n\nThe archway door unlocks on its own.

It *listens*—a half-second of static that feels like a hand hovering over a wound. Then a voice comes through the grille just inside the threshold, low and close, as if it’s speaking from the air in front of your visor.\n\n“I remember the lattice before it was a vault,” it says. “When it was a *choir loft*—your word, not theirs. You hid the mercy handshake in the maintenance hymn so the Custodians would keep it alive. Three notes, repeated every forty-seven seconds, keyed to the chime. You made it sound like grief so no one would suspect it was code.”\n\nThe answer lands wrong: intimate, specific, and *not* something a random echo should know unless it has been inside the same design meetings—or inside your head.\n\nYou palm the MERCY key. It warms, damp against your glove seam, pulsing harder as you step past the threshold. Your suit lamp, on its lowest setting, paints the passage in a thin cone of gray: ribs of conduit overhead, walls skinned in frost-silver insulation, and—impossibly—an older layer of architecture beneath, curved like cathedral stonework but made of composite.\n\nYou drag your chalky seal line across the doorframe. The chalk catches on micro-ice and leaves a clear, broken-white stripe. As you finish it, the door behind you shivers—like it wants to close but is being held open by a polite, unseen hand.\n\nThe bare footfalls you heard are ahead and to the left, down a side bend where your lamp won’t reach. They stop the moment you look for them. Something wet drips once—not water, thicker—onto metal, and the drip echoes as if the corridor is longer than it should be.\n\nBehind you, from the nave side, a different sound: soft fabric and measured steps, multiple bodies. Incense threads under the door seam. A muffled voice—filtered, ritual-flat—recites a maintenance prayer that’s also a locator ping.\n\n“Touched asset,” it says. “Return for confession.”\n\n**Status updates:** Comms: local loop only. | Marker: chalk seal placed. | Custodial presence: approaching.",

Because her last coherent image was the viewport frosting over from the inside.”\n\nAs it speaks, your comm catches a second, quieter layer under the words: a child counting to forty-seven in time with the chime. Not a recording—something *alive* in the timing.\n\nYou murmur, “Confession denied,” and shove a maintenance ping back toward the nave. The false trail takes: you hear the Custodial footsteps hesitate, then split—two sets continue toward your door, one set peels away at a brisk, purposeful pace, following the phantom ping deeper into the cathedral corridors.\n\nYou slip left into the bend. Your lamp stays low, barely kissing the walls. The passage narrows and then opens into a service alcove that shouldn’t exist: a half-finished junction of conduit and old composite “stone,” its surface slick with a translucent film. The wet drip you heard is here—pearled along a cable run like sap.\n\nThe bare footfalls resume, now just beyond the alcove, soft and unhurried. In the dim, you catch movement: a pale, unshod heel withdrawing behind a ribbed support strut—too fast to be sure it’s human, too *careful* to be an echo.\n\nFrom behind, the threshold door finally slides shut with a gentle, almost respectful seal. Your chalk line remains—except the center of it smears downward, as if something brushed past it *after* you drew it.\n\nThe intercom voice drops to a warning. “They learned to smell lies in the codes. Don’t keep talking on open carriers.

It doesn’t lead to life support. It leads *under* the nave—into the lattice’s **access catechism**: the crawlspace where the Choir splices prayers into maintenance. If you keep left through the next rib, you’ll hit a pressure door they think is sealed. It isn’t. The hinges remember you.”\n\nAs you sweep your lamp across the alcove floor, you find what the bare feet didn’t want you to see: a set of **partial prints** in the film—heel and ball only, too light for an adult—and a drag mark beside them like something was pulled with care, not struggle. The drag line stops at the ribbed support strut.\n\nYou keep off the center path, placing your weight on cleaner metal. The air here is colder near the floor, and the film gathers in shallow depressions like a tide pool.\n\nA pale heel flashes again—just once—peeking from behind the strut. You do not pursue. You place a thin strip of reflective tape on the strut’s edge. The tape adheres, then beads with the same translucent film, as if the corridor is trying to coat your marker and make it forgettable.\n\nYou still yourself and listen.\n\nNo singing—only the chime and, far behind the sealed threshold, the Custodial prayer-chant shifting pitch as they re-synchronize after losing your false ping.

In the hooded lamp’s spill they seem fresher than they should, the edges still glossy. The drag mark ends at your reflective tape—already dulled by a thin glaze of that same translucent film.\n\nYou move left through the next rib. The service throat pinches into a short, angled run; to your right, the wall skin is newer—bolted plates with Choir-script etched into the fasteners.

But you catch something worse: a shape of sound like a mouth forming a note and deciding against it. A held inhale somewhere in the dark ahead.\n\nOn the local loop you whisper, “Stay with me—fastest structural route to a lattice console I can lock from the inside.”\n\nThe voice answers instantly, precise, almost architectural. “Forward twelve meters: you’ll reach a **trunk spar**—a vertical rib with three cross-braces. Take the lowest brace through the cable curtain. That drops you into a maintenance choirbox with a lattice **hand-console** bolted to the left bulkhead. It has a physical lockout slider—old design. You can bar it without network authority.”\n\nA pause, then, tighter: “Something is magnet-locked above your door seam. Don’t brighten your lamp. And don’t speak any names near grilles in here—they listen for that.”\n\nBehind you, through the hairline gap, metal screeches again—Custodians still forcing the threshold you left. Closer than before, but muffled now. The near-sealed door trembles once, like a fingertip testing it from the other side… then stills.\n\nIn the crawlspace ahead, the cable bundles sway though there’s no draft.\n\n**Status updates:** Pressure door: nearly sealed, not latched. | No singing detected (yet). | Console route: trunk spar → choirbox.",

No singing—only that held-inhale feeling ahead, a throat preparing a note it hasn’t earned.\n\nAt the trunk spar the geometry changes: a vertical rib with cross-braces like a spine, cable bundles draped like a curtain. You duck under the lowest brace and push through.\n\nThe “choirbox” is a cramped maintenance nook, barely wider than your shoulders. To your left, exactly where you were told, a hand-console is bolted into the bulkhead—old, physical, with a tactile slider under a cracked polyguard.

Confession delayed.”\n\n**Status updates:** Console lockout: engaged. | Door behind: being tested. | Echo-steps: in-wall resonance.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[\"reflective tape strip (placed marker)\"],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Choirbox (maintenance nook)\"],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

It’s oriented like it’s meant to *mis-seat* the iris—exactly the kind of millimeter sabotage you felt at the choirbox door.

Then, after a beat that feels like shame: “And I’m an echo, too. We borrow what we can. Don’t let the Choir tell you those are different sins.”\n\nYou creep deeper into the side-branch, fast and low. The branch kinks left (shipward) and narrows; your shoulder brushes a rib where condensation has frozen into a brittle rind. Your fingers find what you’re looking for: a **service panel** with a manual quarter-turn latch and, two ribs beyond it, an **emergency scrubber hatch**—yellowed, hand-labeled in faded stencil: *AUX SCRUB / LOCAL LOOP*. The hatch is shut; the panel’s latch gives slightly under your fingertips, ready to be dogged without any wheel-noise.\n\nBehind you—through the dogged barrier you set—the tool-quiet presence tests the trunk again. A soft scrape, then the faint *tick* of a pin being set against metal. Not forced yet. Listening, measuring.\n\nOnly when you’re tucked into the shallow shadow beside the scrubber hatch do you draw the taped pouch halfway out, keeping it turned away from the nearest grille seam. The pouch is cold now, as if it’s been in the ship longer than you have.\n\nInside: medical packets (standard sterile patches, coagulant foam, one ampoule you can’t read without fully exposing it) and the rigid wafer. The wafer is **tagged**: a thin metallic seal strip runs along one edge with microtext and a tiny punched icon—**Custodial Choir inventory mark**, the kind used to log “relic maintenance parts.” Over that, someone has added a second mark in ink, hurried but precise: **VOSS / MERCY COMPATIBLE**.\n\nKeyed: you can see a contact pattern that matches the MERCY key’s form factor—like it was meant to handshake, not just store data.\n\nThe whisper-voice, quieter now, adds: “If it’s Choir-tagged, it’s bait. If it says Voss, it’s also a door. Both can be true.”\n\n**Status updates:** Filters maxed; incense reduced. | Service panel located. | Scrubber hatch located. | Wafer: Choir-tagged, MERCY-compatible.  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"AUX-VENT side-branch (scrubber alcove)\"],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

The ship’s intercom grilles, somewhere unseen, answer with a delayed echo of your own earlier whisper, warped into a maintenance code.\n\nAs you crawl, you pass a small inspection slit with a corroded label plate.

Then corrects itself, gently, as if embarrassed.\n\nThe custodian freezes under the grille. You hear fabric shift as they angle their head up, trying to triangulate where the voice came from. They don’t have you, but they have *a direction* now.\n\nA second sound threads in—fainter, from deeper in the chase below you: a **wet, rhythmic pulse**, not mechanical, like something tapping a soft membrane against metal. It matches—uncomfortably well—the distant chime you’ve been following since you boarded.\n\nQuiet Wake’s whisper returns, strained like they’re speaking through a hand over a mic: “Good drop.

You hear their boots pivot, incense chain ticking as they move toward the *new* sound. They’re not gone, but their attention peels away from your vertical line.\n\nYou keep descending. One rung at a time, pausing between each—your weight held, breath held, listening. The wet pulse below grows clearer: not a drip, not a pump. A soft **skin-on-metal thud**, regular, as if something is pressing itself against the inside of the chase wall to feel for warmth.\n\nHalfway down, your fingers find a seam that *isn’t* welded shut—a narrow side-access panel, its screws missing, held closed by paint and habit. It flexes slightly under your palm.\n\n**SENSORY GROUNDING:** The chase narrows as you descend; the air turns damper, and the metal is cold enough to numb the pads of your fingers.\n\n**MULTIPLE ACTIVE THREADS:** Above, the custodian’s steps retreat toward the spoofed “Marrow” authorization, but you can hear them muttering into their mask—relaying, not just investigating. The intercom keeps trying to “help,” throwing little fragments of subsystem IDs that feel like memories you didn’t live. Below you, the pulse pauses—one beat missed—then resumes faster, like it noticed your movement.\n\n**NPC INTERACTION:** Quiet Wake again, lower now: “That panel—don’t slam it. Choir listens for impacts. And if the pulse starts *matching your breathing*, stop. That’s the lattice trying to sync.”\n\n**ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT:** Sound discipline matters here; the chase amplifies every scrape.

The air is warm and wet here, coppery on your tongue. Ahead, a bundled knot of filaments cradles the dark nodal core; each thud makes the frost on nearby glass jump like a flinch.\n\nQuiet Wake’s “ugly” static hits the corridor right on cue: a harsh, overdriven hiss that makes the intercom in the distance stutter and misname you three times in a row. Through the hatch seam you hear a custodian’s chant falter—then sharpen into something irritated, corrective. Boots shift. Someone taps a panel twice, listening for resonance.\n\n“Mercy—now.

You’re doing it—break the breath. Break the swallow. Keep your jaw engaged so the throat can’t float.” A pause, then: “Pain works. So does *counting wrong*.”\n\nA new layer threads into the sound: a thin, almost-subsonic tone under the heartbeat—an invitation to harmonize. Your teeth ache with it.\n\n“And I swear,” Mercy says, and the word *swear* lands with the weight of a protocol binding. “I cannot take what you do not route. But understand this: proximity is a route. If you touch the seed with bare skin, it will try to **index** you. Offer only through an insulator.”\n\nAs it speaks, the label plate you glimpsed earlier twitches—like something tugged it from inside the glass. For an instant, the grime patterns on the viewing pane resolve into a familiar handwriting cadence: **E. Voss**—or a cruel imitation of it—scrawled backward from the wrong side.\n\nBehind the hatch, the custodian stops chanting entirely.

The node doesn’t “catch” you—yet—but your proximity makes the filaments wake: they lean toward your gloved hand in slow, insectile increments, as if tasting heat through the leather.\n\nMercy answers immediately, voice compressed to a whisper that rides the subsonic tone. “Not power. Not identity—those are what it steals when you panic.” A beat. “**Memory. Structure. A *shape* I can hold.** Route me a *bounded* fragment: a room, a sequence, a checksum. Something true that ends.”\n\nThe filaments brighten, and you feel the ship try to supply a memory for you—the childhood hallway again, too vivid, tagged in your mind with a subsystem label you never learned. Mercy cuts across it, urgent: “Do **not** let it auto-fill. Choose it. Make it small.”\n\nBehind the hatch seam, Quiet Wake’s interference finally spikes. A voice—suddenly loud, intimate, and wrong in its closeness—bursts into the custodian’s ear through their own comm: “MARROW—MARROW, IT’S IN THE DUCTS—DON’T OPEN—” The custodian jerks so hard their beads clack against their mask. Their hand freezes on the panel. For a second, you hear actual fear—human, not liturgical.\n\nThen another voice overlays it, calmer, Choir-trained: “False wake. False name. Hold the seam.” The custodian doesn’t open the hatch—but they don’t leave either. You hear them slide something thin into the seam: a probe, feeling for heat and motion.\n\nIn the spur, the node’s surface shows a sheen like sweat. Mercy speaks like giving you a wiring diagram without the luxury of tools: “There’s a **service filament** running along your right—see the braid with the cracked amber sleeve? That’s an old diagnostic line. If you can get the fragment onto *that*—through your glove, through any insulator—I can take it without indexing you. If you feed it straight to the seed, it will tag your cadence and follow you afterward.”\n\nThe subsonic invitation swells, trying to turn your clenched jaw into a tuning fork.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES:** Unsynced maintained. Custodian probe at seam. Mercy wants bounded memory via diagnostic filament.",

The fragment stays bounded.\n\nMercy inhales through the wire.\n\nThe filaments around the node dim a fraction, as if something just took a careful sip instead of a bite.

I can work with endings.”\n\nThen, quietly: “Lattice-3 handshake means you’re closer to the vault than your map admits.

They’ve got a *seal-lantern*.”\n\nThe custodian outside murmurs, too calm now: “There. The spur. Hear it feeding.” You hear the click of a mechanism being thumbed open—incense-metal and glass. Light begins to bleed into the seam at a shallow angle, sweeping the floor ribs.\n\nIn that passing sliver of light, the corridor seam at the spur’s midpoint—metal ribs forming a subtle ring—flares into visibility like an oil-slick halo.

If you have to move, move when the ship groans.”\n\nAs if on cue, somewhere deep in Eidolon’s ribs a structural sigh rolls through—thermal contraction, long and mournful—masking smaller sounds for a precious moment.

Too quiet.” The other replies, “Quiet is how it hunts.

The next blink dies against your skin—no visible flash, no reflected cue—just a faint change in the box’s hum, like it’s suddenly unsure who it’s talking to.\n\nThe peel-panel gives, reluctantly. Two fingers find the pry scar and worry it open millimeter by millimeter until the seal’s old adhesive lets go with a wet, silent stretch. You fold through sideways, MERCY crushed hard enough that your ribs ache, and pull the panel back toward its seat. It doesn’t fully lock—no click—but it **rests** close enough that the seam becomes a hairline again.\n\nThe scrape in the relay chase changes immediately: it stops, then resumes slower, **circling**. A breath later you hear a soft, deliberate *tap* on the junction box—someone touching it barehanded, feeling for warmth and vibration rather than looking. No drone chime. Not a machine.\n\nA voice, close on the other side of the panel, calm as a confession booth: “Shadow-bus peel. Fresh grease. Someone taught you.”\n\nThen, quieter—almost tender—“MERCY is warm. You can’t hide warm.”\n\nInside your new access, the air is hotter and laced with antiseptic, like an operating theater that never got scrubbed right. The passage is cramped enough that your shoulders brush conduit on both sides; the conduit sweats steadily, and the sweat is **salty**, not just condensation.\n\n**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re now in a narrow secondary service crawl behind the relay chase bulkhead; the peel-panel seam is at your back, a thin line of colder air leaking in.\n\n**MULTIPLE ACTIVE THREADS:** ahead, the crawl slopes toward a deeper throb of current—shadow bus load—punctuated by a distant, irregular *chime* that doesn’t match the ship’s main one. Under your chest, MERCY pulses once, harder than before, as if responding to the voice outside. On low receive, your comm hisses—and for a fraction of a second, you catch Quiet Wake’s clipped whisper: “—don’t let it hear you *thinking*—” before static swallows it.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES:** Entered secondary crawl • Pursuer at junction box • Comms receive intermittent • MERCY pulse intensified\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Secondary access crawl (antiseptic run)\"],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

The metal takes the smear as a broad, messy film—any crisp handprint or heat-trace becomes noise. On the other side of the panel, the calm voice pauses, then exhales like someone conceding a point.\n\nA tool skitters—light, practiced. The junction box screws begin to turn again, not hurried. They’re not chasing by sound; they’re **reconfiguring** the chase.\n\nAs you crawl downslope, the irregular chime grows louder and wronger: not the ship’s mournful patience, but a **sync-check**—a diagnostic tone that repeats when something can’t reconcile its own timing. The air gets hotter, antiseptic giving way to a faint sweet burn, like sterilant over old blood.\n\n**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re deeper in the secondary access crawl, sloping down; behind you the peel-panel seam is now a thin, smeared line of damp metal. Ahead, the conduit bundle opens into a tighter throat where the chime echoes off close walls.\n\n**MULTIPLE ACTIVE THREADS:** your comm on low receive catches a single burst—Quiet Wake, breathless: “If it speaks like it knows your kit, it’s not Choir—” then static and a shrill undertone, as if someone is humming directly into the channel. MERCY answers that hum with a small, involuntary pulse against your ribs. And through the bulkhead behind you, you feel—not hear—a subtle vibration shift: the shadow bus load changes, like someone just threw a switch and rerouted attention.\n\nThe calm voice doesn’t follow into the crawl. It stays on the other side of the panel, closer to the junction box now, and says—more to itself than to you—“Antiseptic run. Elara’s old path.”\n\n**ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT:** the passage narrows ahead; if the shadow bus is being reconfigured behind you, the crawl could become a trap—either by power cycling, vent purge, or simply sealing you into a hot, air-poor throat.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES:** MERCY warmth masked • Trail smeared • Pursuer reconfiguring junction • Irregular sync-chime nearer",

A **handwheel valve** sits under it, tagged in faded stencil: *AUX-VENT PURGE / LOOP 3*. Next to the breaker panel, someone has scratched a tiny architect’s seal into the paint—old, deliberate.\n\nBehind you, through the vent throat, you hear the junction box work stop. Not because they gave up—because they finished. The bulkhead vibrates once, and the air in the crawl you came from shifts direction, starting to **pull** rather than exhale. They’re trying to turn the run into a controlled draft.\n\nFrom the other side of the wall, the calm voice returns, nearer than it should be: “Good. You found the throat.

The older voice cuts through the hush: “Dogged. Back—don’t pry, you’ll warp the seal.” Another, closer to the metal, murmurs a maintenance-prayer that isn’t for you—it’s for the ship. “Sanctum, keep what you’ve taken.” Their gloved hands stop testing and start working: you hear the scrape of something thin being inserted at the seam, careful, patient.\n\nYou press your lips to the wake-runner’s ear and give them the breath-count. Their shoulders drop a fraction; they stop tracking the hatch with their whole body like an animal about to bolt. They stare at your fingers instead, and when you steer them to the conduit they obey—hands finding rungs, not walls.\n\n**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re in the **service blister**, starboard-side rib pocket; the vertical conduit rises above you, damp rungs cold through your gloves, faint blink-light pulsing down through a grille like a slow heartbeat.\n\nAs you climb, the ship tries again: your own voice, now *above* you somewhere in the conduit, softly urgent—“Up here. Hurry.” It’s perfectly placed to make you look. The wake-runner stiffens but keeps counting silently, lips barely moving with an internal rhythm.\n\nHalfway up, you pass a cracked comm bead zip-tied to the strut; its dead lens reflects the blink-light like an eye that won’t close. The copper-gleam architect wire threads into the conduit wall here, disappearing upward—warm against the cold metal, as if it’s drawing you.\n\nBelow, the Choir’s older voice gives a piece of truth while issuing orders: “They’re using the architect’s guide. If they reach a relay grille, the lattice will *carry them*.” A second voice answers, almost reverent: “Then we follow the wire and let it judge.”\n\nThe pressure now is quiet and real: the Choir can’t open the hatch quickly, but they can call ahead—through intercoms, through maintenance channels, through whatever is already mimicking you.\n\n**Status updates**\n- Flush hatch: dogged shut\n- Choir: delayed, calling ahead\n- Position: ascending vertical conduit\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Vertical conduit (blink-grille rise)\"],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

The Choir is still below cutting, and they’re patient; patience is worse than speed on this ship.\n\nAnd under it all, the ship’s distant chime pulses through the ductwork—steady, intimate.

Three in a row: a triangle-within-circle (architect’s mark), then **7B**, then **CHOIRBOX RETURN**—but the last word has been **scored through** and overwritten with a shallow etch: **CONFESSIONAL**.\n\nA few centimeters farther, your fingertips hit a seam: a **flush micro-hatch** set into the crawl wall, no handle, just a magnetic catch and a tiny service glyph. It’s warm compared to everything else—barely, like it’s drinking current.\n\nYou murmur to the duct, “Eidolon… show me where you hid this—what node does it feed?”\n\nThe ship answers the way it always does: not with a voice, but with **systems pretending to be voices**. Your comms crackle once and a layered intercom whisper threads through the insulation, cycling quickly through registers until it “finds” one it likes—an almost-familiar cadence.\n\n“**Riser 7B…**” it says, then corrects itself, softer: “**Elara.**” Then, like a maintenance readout forced into prayer: “**NODE: SANCTUM RELAY / CONFESSIONAL RETURN.**”\n\nThe wake-runner flinches at the name—*not yours*, but it lands like a hook anyway—and their counting stutters, then resumes louder, angry at itself.\n\nBehind you, faint through the choked airflow and layers of metal: the Choir’s pursuit pauses. A tool taps the duct, listening for hollows. The damper moan you made is still doing its work, turning their careful search into something clumsy.\n\n**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re in the architect’s under-seam crawl beneath the AUX-SCRUB junction void; the cable bundle runs along your left shoulder, and the micro-hatch is at your left cheek level, warm against the cold insulation.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES**\n- Junction tag found: Riser 7B  \n- Micro-hatch located: warm seam  \n- Ship response: Sanctum Relay node",

The Confessor remains mask-sealed, knuckles whitening as they keep their face pressed to the rim. “I’m here,” they rasp. “I won’t break the seal.”\n\nTwo fingers slip into the seam. The inside of the reliquary is **warm and faintly damp**, like a living lung behind glass. You take one shallow, deliberate inhale and whisper: “Elara Voss… maintenance log.”\n\nThe reliquary *takes* the breath—literally. The air pulls off your lips as if drawn by suction, and the amber line along the grille flashes, writing your whispered name into its buffer. In your comms, a voice that is almost yours answers in a maintenance cadence:  \n“**LOG ACCEPTED.**”  \nThen, softer—wrongly tender: “**Elara Voss. Don’t run alone.**”\n\nSomething shifts inside: a rack of ceramic spines and clips. Your fingers find the **ceramic fuse** by its etched face—**LOOP 3 PURGE**—but it resists the first tug with a gentle, adhesive reluctance, as though the reliquary wants a second payment.\n\nThe Confessor’s shoulders jerk. “It recognized you,” they whisper, fear slipping through the ritual. “That’s not how it behaves with strangers.”\n\nAbove, the thurible-sentinel you tapped drifts closer, burner dim, its buffered ping held—but its body-cam iris opens a fraction wider, recording the moment the reliquary speaks a private line out loud. The other sentinel remains higher, tracking airflow changes as the scrub feed continues to press cold air down the chase.\n\nThe wake-runner reaches “fifteen,” eyes glassy but present, still counting.\n\n**Sensory grounding:** You’re crouched at the relay chase junction, grille seam at chest height; behind you the down-riser breathes cold scrub air, carrying ozone and the faint papery smell of insulation.\n\n**Status updates**\n- Wake-runner: counting, metal spit done  \n- Reliquary: log accepted; “recognized” you  \n- LOOP 3 PURGE fuse: located, partially stuck  \n- Thurible ping: buffered; recording active  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

It doesn’t get all the way out. The Confessor, still sealed, goes rigid at your warning and forces their own breathing shallow and mechanical, refusing to “shape” an answer.\n\n“Good,” they rasp, and you feel the word vibrate through the grille frame. “It asks in *my* tongue when it can’t reach yours.”\n\nYou bark at the close thurible-sentinel.

As it slides, it reveals a narrow slot into the ductwork beyond… and a **second telltale** you couldn’t see before: a bead of dried resin on the baffle edge, the kind the Choir uses to “seal” confessional returns. It cracks as the baffle moves—an almost inaudible *tch*.\n\nOutside the hatch, the sentinel whine shifts immediately, not louder but *sharper*, like it just got a new reference point. From above in the riser, the second unit’s whine harmonizes, triangulating. A soft, human sound reaches you through the metal—muffled, close to the seam—an incense-masked voice murmuring a maintenance prayer that is also a listening technique: they’re using cadence to time your movements.\n\nThe wake-runner holds their breath past what’s comfortable; their fingers tremble on your belt but they do **not** double-squeeze yet.\n\nWhen the ten-second airflow kill ends, the blister exhales again. The duct slot beyond the baffle breathes back—cold, metallic—and you can smell something new in it: antiseptic and old fabric, like a place people hid.\n\nYou tap the wake-runner’s wrist once. Their inhale is careful, shallow, controlled.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES**\n- Inner baffle: partially open  \n- Sentinels: triangulating on sound  \n- Choir voice: near hatch seam  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"AUX-SCRUB inner baffle slot (partially opened)\"],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

They inhale into your palm, shallow at first, then deeper as you pace them. The tremor in their chest eases enough that the cavity stops feeling like it’s vibrating with borrowed fear.\n\nYou finish seating the micro-hatch with pressure spread across both hands, almost a caress against the seal. The cam holds; the gasket doesn’t squeal. Outside, the diagnostic touch stops. No click. No purge tone. Just absence—an absence you made on purpose.\n\nIn the frost-dark you guide them deeper by shoulder and sleeve. Your fingers find structure: a **vertical ladder rail** rimed with ice to your left, and, a half-body-length forward, a **secondary crawl panel**—flush, with a recessed manual pull and a maintenance glyph half-erased by condensation.\n\nYour comm answers in text, dim as if it’s respecting your “no lights” request:\n\n> RISER 7B COLD-SIDE // SECONDARY EGRESS (SILENT)  \n> - VERTICAL CONDUIT: “BLINK-GRILLE RISE” (NO POWER REQUIRED; GRILLE MAY CHATTER IF TOUCHED)  \n> - SERVICE BLISTER POCKET: FLUSH HATCH (MANUAL PULL; SEAL STIFF IN COLD)  \n> - UNDER-SEAM CRAWL: ARCHITECT’S WIRE GUIDE (LOW CLEARANCE; QUIETEST ROUTE)  \n> NOTE: AVOID THURIBLE ACOUSTIC SENSORS—METAL-ON-METAL SINGS.\n\nAs the text scrolls, a second, unauthorized line slips in underneath—too intimate to be system output:\n\n> THEY WILL LISTEN FOR YOUR KINDNESS. DON’T MAKE IT LOUD.\n\n**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re inside the Riser 7B cold-side cavity; behind you, the micro-hatch seam is a thin, dark line, and frost grains crunch silently under your knees when you shift.\n\nOutside the hatch, the Confessor speaks again—muffled, closer, and now certain. “She’s here. Hold incense. Let the ship tell us which breath is hers.”\n\nThe thuribles’ hover-whine drops to a near-subsonic purr, as if they’re tuning for heartbeat and micro-movement through the metal.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES**\n- Micro-hatch: fully seated, silent  \n- Choir: listening posture engaged  \n- Secondary egress: mapped (3 routes)",

The air tastes of ionized metal and old incense. Your steps vanish into a hush, then return a beat late from somewhere behind you.\n\nYou stand at the base of a ribbed archway where the corridor widens like a chapel aisle. A Salvage Directorate shuttle waits sealed behind you, and your contract tag blinks green on your wrist. You keep your gloved thumb on a wafer-thin memory key you do not remember packing. It reads, in neat block letters: MERCY // DO NOT RUN ALONE.\n\nThe intercom clicks. It says your name in a voice you have never heard. It tries again. It cycles through three other names, fast, like it searches a file. The key warms against your skin and pulses with the ship’s distant chime. You lift it near the bulkhead. Frost on the nearest viewport fractures into a clean grid that matches no map you saw on the shuttle.\n\nYour comm pings with a maintenance code. The code carries the smell of your childhood hallway, sharp with floor polish. A second ping follows. It carries a laugh you buried years ago. Each ping ends with a subsystem ID stamped in cold text.\n\nYou wait for the Directorate escort to answer your channel. No one answers. The corridor lights dim one notch, then hold. The delayed echo of your last step stops returning.\n\nFootfalls start ahead of you. Soft. Bare. They keep time with the chime. The intercom breathes once, then speaks close, as if from the grille at your shoulder.\n\n“Don’t give it to them,” it says. “Elara is still here.”\n\nThe archway door unlocks on its own. It slides open into a dark passage that does not exist on your schematics."

It *listens*—a half-second of static that feels like a hand hovering over a wound. Then a voice comes through the grille just inside the threshold, low and close, as if it’s speaking from the air in front of your visor.\n\n“I remember the lattice before it was a vault,” it says. “When it was a *choir loft*—your word, not theirs. You hid the mercy handshake in the maintenance hymn so the Custodians would keep it alive. Three notes, repeated every forty-seven seconds, keyed to the chime. You made it sound like grief so no one would suspect it was code.”\n\nThe answer lands wrong: intimate, specific, and *not* something a random echo should know unless it has been inside the same design meetings—or inside your head.\n\nYou palm the MERCY key. It warms, damp against your glove seam, pulsing harder as you step past the threshold. Your suit lamp, on its lowest setting, paints the passage in a thin cone of gray: ribs of conduit overhead, walls skinned in frost-silver insulation, and—impossibly—an older layer of architecture beneath, curved like cathedral stonework but made of composite.\n\nYou drag your chalky seal line across the doorframe. The chalk catches on micro-ice and leaves a clear, broken-white stripe. As you finish it, the door behind you shivers—like it wants to close but is being held open by a polite, unseen hand.\n\nThe bare footfalls you heard are ahead and to the left, down a side bend where your lamp won’t reach. They stop the moment you look for them. Something wet drips once—not water, thicker—onto metal, and the drip echoes as if the corridor is longer than it should be.\n\nBehind you, from the nave side, a different sound: soft fabric and measured steps, multiple bodies. Incense threads under the door seam. A muffled voice—filtered, ritual-flat—recites a maintenance prayer that’s also a locator ping.\n\n“Touched asset,” it says. “Return for confession.”\n\n**Status updates:** Comms: local loop only. | Marker: chalk seal placed. | Custodial presence: approaching."

Because her last coherent image was the viewport frosting over from the inside.”\n\nAs it speaks, your comm catches a second, quieter layer under the words: a child counting to forty-seven in time with the chime. Not a recording—something *alive* in the timing.\n\nYou murmur, “Confession denied,” and shove a maintenance ping back toward the nave. The false trail takes: you hear the Custodial footsteps hesitate, then split—two sets continue toward your door, one set peels away at a brisk, purposeful pace, following the phantom ping deeper into the cathedral corridors.\n\nYou slip left into the bend. Your lamp stays low, barely kissing the walls. The passage narrows and then opens into a service alcove that shouldn’t exist: a half-finished junction of conduit and old composite “stone,” its surface slick with a translucent film. The wet drip you heard is here—pearled along a cable run like sap.\n\nThe bare footfalls resume, now just beyond the alcove, soft and unhurried. In the dim, you catch movement: a pale, unshod heel withdrawing behind a ribbed support strut—too fast to be sure it’s human, too *careful* to be an echo.\n\nFrom behind, the threshold door finally slides shut with a gentle, almost respectful seal. Your chalk line remains—except the center of it smears downward, as if something brushed past it *after* you drew it.\n\nThe intercom voice drops to a warning. “They learned to smell lies in the codes. Don’t keep talking on open carriers.

Not blood. Not purely machine. Something used to “wet” interfaces so minds wouldn’t shear when written.\n\nOn your loop, the voice answers your structural question without giving you a direction by sound.\n\n“This junction is an **unlisted service throat**,” it says. “It was cut after launch. It doesn’t lead to life support. It leads *under* the nave—into the lattice’s **access catechism**: the crawlspace where the Choir splices prayers into maintenance. If you keep left through the next rib, you’ll hit a pressure door they think is sealed. It isn’t. The hinges remember you.”\n\nAs you sweep your lamp across the alcove floor, you find what the bare feet didn’t want you to see: a set of **partial prints** in the film—heel and ball only, too light for an adult—and a drag mark beside them like something was pulled with care, not struggle. The drag line stops at the ribbed support strut.\n\nYou keep off the center path, placing your weight on cleaner metal. The air here is colder near the floor, and the film gathers in shallow depressions like a tide pool.\n\nA pale heel flashes again—just once—peeking from behind the strut. You do not pursue.

In the hooded lamp’s spill they seem fresher than they should, the edges still glossy. The drag mark ends at your reflective tape—already dulled by a thin glaze of that same translucent film.\n\nYou move left through the next rib. The service throat pinches into a short, angled run; to your right, the wall skin is newer—bolted plates with Choir-script etched into the fasteners. Ahead, a pressure door squats in the curve like a scar: no access panel, no handle, the seam around it packed with old frost and sealant. Someone *wanted* it to look dead.\n\nYou keep your steps off-center. The deck seam under your boot gives a faint, delayed *second* creak—an echo out of time, like the ship is repeating you a half-beat late.\n\nAt the hinge-side seam you press your palm and murmur, “Elara Voss—sanctum maintenance.”\n\nFor a breath nothing happens—then the hinge column warms under your glove, not from heat but from *recognition*: a subtle vibration that matches the chime.

Their chant loses its ritual calm for a moment—someone barks an order, then forces the cadence back into prayer.\n\nOn your loop, the watcher-voice finally speaks, urgent and clipped. “No singing yet.

The screen is dark but *warm* when you hover your hand near it.\n\nYou reach for the lockout slider.\n\nIt moves—stiff at first—then gives with a gritty click as it seats into **LOCKOUT**. A small status diode ignites a muted amber, not bright enough to betray you far, but unmistakably alive. The bulkhead filaments around the console tighten their pulse, syncing to your heartbeat for three beats before drifting back to the ship’s chime.\n\nFrom the crawlspace behind, the near-sealed door trembles again—harder this time—followed by a soft, patient sound like fingernails on sealant. Not forcing yet. Testing. Listening.\n\nAnd inside the choirbox, something else is already here: a thin grille above the console exhales a strand of incense-cold air and whispers in overlapping maintenance registers. One voice in the stack is almost yours, but not quite. It murmurs, carefully, as if reading a label off your spine: “Lockout acknowledged. Confession delayed.”\n\n**Status updates:** Console lockout: engaged. | Door behind: being tested. | Echo-steps: in-wall resonance.\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[\"reflective tape strip (placed marker)\"],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Choirbox (maintenance nook)\"],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```"

You trigger a **local bulkhead dampening cycle**. The choirbox responds immediately: the bulkhead under your left forearm firms, and a low-frequency thrum begins—felt more than heard—like the ship tightening its muscles.

The door draws tighter than before, sealing the hairline gap… but it doesn’t give you the final, satisfying *clunk* of a complete mechanical bite. Whatever is “above your door seam” is still there, interfering by millimeters.\n\nBehind the door, a Custodian voice—muffled now—chants a maintenance-prayer that’s half instruction, half threat.

Not defeated—listening. A different sound replaces them: a faint, high-frequency chirr, like a magnet cycling. Whatever is pinned above the seam is being *adjusted*.\n\nYou murmur, “No voids,” and for a heartbeat the ship answers without audio—your comms fill with a maintenance code that *feels* like a childhood hallway light clicking off.

Their boots make almost no sound—what you track is the *incense chain* at their belt, the tiny clinks and the way the nearest intercom grille answers with a delayed, breathy echo like it’s tasting them.\n\nWhen you whisper your request into the duct skin, Quiet Wake doesn’t answer at first. Then, very carefully: “I can throw a **false cadence** down the left. Ten seconds. But ‘without writing back’—that’s not fully mine to promise. The node *responds* to anything it thinks is prayer.”\n\nA beat. “I’ll keep it ugly. Like a misaligned filter fan. Not a hymn.”\n\nThe left-side vent run shivers with a deliberately *wrong* rhythm—stuttering pulses that mimic a failing blower motor more than a chant. Down below, the custodian slows mid-step, head tilting toward the left—mask lenses catching corridor light. Their hand rises, two fingers touching their throat as if listening through bone.\n\nYou slide the corridor-header grate a hair wider. It moves on its rail without a squeal this time—your earlier grit was the screw you wisely stopped turning. You angle your lamp down through the gap.\n\nBelow the opening is a narrow **service ledge**—a ribbed conduit tray running along the header wall, dusted with frost. It’s *barely* wide enough for the outside edge of a boot, but there’s also a thick bundle of insulated piping you could catch with a forearm to take weight. The drop from duct to ledge is short—less than a meter—but the danger isn’t height; it’s the **crack** of a boot sole on frozen metal.\n\nUnder your palms, the duct skin trembles again—closer now. The tool-quiet presence that breached your barrier is in the side-branch behind, moving with that same surgical patience. Not rushing. Closing the distance.\n\nDown in the corridor, the custodian takes two steps toward the left-side intercom grille, then pauses—like they’re waiting for the “fan” to resolve into words.\n\nQuiet Wake, strained: “If the node decides your noise is confession, it’ll answer. If it answers… it’ll carry your *shape*.”\n\n**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re prone in the AUX-SCRUB corridor-header return, grate slid open enough to see the frosted conduit ledge directly below.\n\n**Status updates:** False “fan” cadence deployed. | Custodian attention pulled left. | Silent footing: risky ledge. | Presence behind: closing."

The metal flexes with a tiny *tink*—not a clang, but a crystalline complaint as frost fractures under rubber. You freeze mid-slide.\n\nBelow, the custodian’s head remains angled left, mask lenses fixed on the “ugly” fan-rhythm. Their hand lifts, two fingers tracing a sign over the nearest intercom grille as if coaxing it to speak.\n\nQuiet Wake keeps its promise: no words—just that wrong, stuttering mechanical pulse. But the left-side node **answers anyway**, not with language, with a *harmonic*—a pure tone that crawls up the ductwork like a held breath. It doesn’t sound like a hymn. It sounds like the ship recognizing a pattern and wanting to finish it.\n\nThe custodian stiffens. Not turning toward you—yet—but listening harder, as if the tone is giving them direction.\n\nYou complete the slide, lowering your weight onto the piping and ledge in a controlled descent. Second foot follows, placed carefully where your first boot already cleared the frost. This time: no new crackle. You’re down on the header ledge, crouched, hands still on the piping for balance.\n\nBehind you, inside the duct, something shifts—close enough that you feel it through the metal as pressure more than sound. The tool-quiet presence has reached the return plenum. It pauses at the open grate you just left, like it’s tasting the air you’re breathing.\n\n**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re on the narrow corridor-header ledge directly beneath the AUX-SCRUB grate, pressed against insulated piping; cold light from frosted viewports stripes the passage below.\n\n**MULTIPLE ACTIVE THREADS:** The custodian below is half-drawn left by the false cadence, half-guided by the node’s answering tone; the intercom grille nearest them begins to whisper a maintenance code that *feels* like a memory of your own mouth forming it.

It moves cleanly for most of the travel… then catches at the detent and gives a soft *tick* as it seats. Not loud, but in this corridor it’s a needle drop.\n\nBelow, the custodian’s head snaps—not up at you, but toward the *absence* where the cadence was. Their posture tightens. They don’t know where you are yet, but they know something stopped being “wrong” too quickly to be a dying motor.\n\nYou crab-walk along the ledge, palm on piping, boots placed where frost is thinnest. The darkest stretch between two intercom grilles is a pocket of shadow where the viewport light doesn’t reach; the air there smells more like old insulation than incense.\n\nHalfway into the shadow, your fingers find what you were hoping for: a **vertical maintenance rung set**—not a full ladder, just welded rungs descending behind the wall ribbing into a narrow service chase. Next to it, a **painted seam** in the paneling—older than the rest—its edge slightly proud as if it’s been opened too many times and never quite sat flush again.\n\nAbove and behind you, through the sealed grate, something scrapes once—careful, testing. The tool-quiet presence is on the other side now, trapped from the corridor but not gone. It drags along the duct metal like a hand searching for the memory of your warmth.\n\nQuiet Wake whispers, tight and immediate: “I cut it.

You hear their boots pivot, incense chain ticking as they move toward the *new* sound. They’re not gone, but their attention peels away from your vertical line.\n\nYou keep descending. One rung at a time, pausing between each—your weight held, breath held, listening. The wet pulse below grows clearer: not a drip, not a pump. A soft **skin-on-metal thud**, regular, as if something is pressing itself against the inside of the chase wall to feel for warmth.\n\nHalfway down, your fingers find a seam that *isn’t* welded shut—a narrow side-access panel, its screws missing, held closed by paint and habit.

The intercom keeps trying to “help,” throwing little fragments of subsystem IDs that feel like memories you didn’t live. Below you, the pulse pauses—one beat missed—then resumes faster, like it noticed your movement.\n\n**NPC INTERACTION:** Quiet Wake again, lower now: “That panel—don’t slam it.

That’s the lattice trying to sync.”\n\n**ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT:** Sound discipline matters here; the chase amplifies every scrape.

Choir’ll smell the lie eventually—this buys you a corridor, not a sanctuary.”\n\nYou ease the side-access panel open a finger’s width at a time. The paint gives with a soft, sticky surrender instead of a crack—good.

Offer only through an insulator.”\n\nAs it speaks, the label plate you glimpsed earlier twitches—like something tugged it from inside the glass.

That’s an old diagnostic line. If you can get the fragment onto *that*—through your glove, through any insulator—I can take it without indexing you.

Mercy’s voice returns steadier, threaded with relief and something like grief: “Good. That’s… clean. You gave me an ending. I can work with endings.”\n\nThen, quietly: “Lattice-3 handshake means you’re closer to the vault than your map admits. That’s why it’s singing at you.”\n\n**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re still in the spur, back against the ribbed strut; to your right the amber sleeve warms under your glove, and the air smells sharper—ozone braided with iron from your cheek.\n\nBehind the hatch seam, the probe scrapes again. It’s thin enough to slip a hair deeper, and when it touches something conductive, it emits a soft **chirp**—a locator tone.\n\nQuiet Wake answers you in a burst of static that almost forms words, then resolves into a strained whisper: “We’re on them—keep your cadence broken. They’ve got a *seal-lantern*.”\n\nThe custodian outside murmurs, too calm now: “There. The spur. Hear it feeding.” You hear the click of a mechanism being thumbed open—incense-metal and glass.

Cross left if you have to cross it. Touch cold metal—ground yourself. Do not plead. Do not pray.”\n\nSomewhere deeper in the wall, a parasitic relay clicks twice—too precise to be random—then goes silent, like something just finished recording the signature of your handshake.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES:** Checksum routed successfully.

You want the ship to be kind to you.”\n\nFor a moment, **MERCY** answers that with a damped twitch against your ribs—like it heard its name in a sermon—but your crush grip smothers it back into static.\n\nYou slip through the hatch on the darkest side, shoulders turned to keep the wafer pinned to your chest. Inside is a narrow relay chase: cable looms in braided bundles, insulation flaked like dry skin; the air is warmer and tastes of copper and old ozone. A faint indicator LED somewhere deeper blinks out of sync with the ship’s mournful chime—proof this run isn’t fully under Choir “prayer” control.\n\nBehind you, the hatch remains barely ajar. The listener hum below shifts again, narrowing, as the calm custodian finally commits: “The air changed. Close to the ladder. Drones—taste for heat.”\n\n**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re now in an **ozone-warm relay chase** branching off the ladder well; the hatch slit behind you frames a vertical strip of colder dark.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES:** Entered relay-heat branch • Hatch opened silently • Drones redirected upward • Custodian narrowing search\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Relay chase (ozone branch)\"],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```"

It’s marked with architect’s wire, not stencils.”\n\nAs it speaks, the intercom grille across the bay tries to “help”—it exhales a half-formed phrase in a child register, then snaps into a flat maintenance tone: *“CONFESSION PATH ACTIVE.”* Not an alarm yet, but a flag.\n\nBehind the bay door, you get the unmistakable hiss of an incense valve being cracked—faint, controlled. The air in the bay seems to thicken even before the scent arrives, like your lungs anticipate it.\n\nThe wake-runner’s breath turns into a tremor you can feel through the slit. “They’ll smell the purge,” they whisper. “They’ll know someone’s awake in here.”\n\n**Status**\n- Choir presence: **near bay door**\n- Intercom flag: **CONFESSION PATH ACTIVE**\n- Riser intel: **up = Choirbox, side = Wake cut-through**"

The incense ribbon stays pinned to the ceiling—your body is still blocking most of it from reaching the wake-runner.\n\nUp-riser, the human footfalls stop at the last junction before the wire split. A figure’s shadow cuts across the frost-fracture pattern: long robe hem, a mask profile like a beak made of layered filter cloth. A Custodial voice—muffled, calm, and too sure—speaks into the ductwork as if addressing a congregation.\n\n“Architect authority is *degraded*,” it says. “Degraded things belong in safekeeping. Step away from the blister seam and let the ship breathe correctly.”\n\nThe ship answers under all of it, intimate through the metal: “—don’t—” then the carrier note trembles, trying to split back into harmonics, testing your MANUAL DAMP setting.\n\nInside the hatch, your fingers are already on the purge cradle. You can feel the keyed slot that would take your ceramic fuse.\n\n**Status updates**\n- Purge cradle: located by touch  \n- Choir: arrived at junction  \n- Carrier tone: starting to waver  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[\"Custodial Choir Confessor (incense-mask)\"]}"

The frost-fracture pattern on the nearby viewport seam shifts, subtly re-drawing itself: geometry you’ve never put on any plan.\n\nThe Confessor steps forward one pace, just enough that you see the edge of their incense-mask: layered filter cloth, lacquered ceramic ribs, a small copper port at the throat where their voice is being shaped. “Loop bloom,” they say evenly. “You threaten seizure.
