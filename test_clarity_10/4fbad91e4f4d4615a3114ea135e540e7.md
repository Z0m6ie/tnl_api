### Turn 4 [PLAYER]

Rhea Kade is a disgraced orbital marine who survived a boarding action that the official reports claim never happened. Now a contract security enforcer on deep-space salvage runs, she’s combat-hardened, distrustful, and quick to anger. She keeps everyone at arm’s length, but moves like she’s always expecting the dark to bite back. Rhea’s goal is to drag the truth out of the corporation that buried her unit—no matter how many bodies it takes to make them listen.

*Agent reasoning: Generated aggressive-style character for Sci-Fi Horror Survival*

### Turn 5 [GAME]

Here's your character:

**Rhea Kade**
*Contract security enforcer for deep-space salvage crews (ex-orbital marine)*

Once an orbital marine, Rhea was the sole survivor of a classified boarding action that corporate officials insist never occurred, leaving her branded unstable and quietly discharged. She now takes deep-space salvage security contracts, chasing derelicts and black sites where the logs don’t match the scars. The incident left her with a hair-trigger temper and a habit of treating every shadow like an ambush, but also with a stubborn refusal to die quietly.

**Traits:** Combat-hardened, Distrustful, Quick-tempered, Hypervigilant, Relentlessly determined
**Goal:** Force the corporation to acknowledge the erased boarding action and expose who ordered her unit buried—by stealing the proof, extracting confessions, or burning down the chain of command until someone finally tells the truth.

### Turn 9 [GAME]

The shuttle airlock smells like burnt lubricant and old ozone. You float in the throat of the derelict *Sable Accord*, three hours off the dock. Your jaw aches from clenching. You tell yourself you only need the core recorder. You tell yourself you can trade proof for a name.

You check your mag boots. You tap each clip on your chest rig. You run your thumb along the seam of your helmet like you can feel lies through it. Contract work stays simple. Secure the corridor. Keep the salvage crew alive. Get paid. You keep your temper on a short leash and you keep your eyes moving.

The first step sticks. The deck pulls at your boot like tack. Emergency strips pulse amber over smeared handprints. The smear shines wet. It should not. Helix Meridian—the corporate licensing cartel—tagged this wreck as cold and clean.

Your comms hiss. You hear a heavy thud. Then another. Not metal cooling. Not drifting junk. It lands with intent. Your shoulders go tight before you can stop them.

Your scanner pings the corridor ahead. It catches a return that repeats in a pattern. Three short. One long. Like someone testing a mic. The sound crawls under your skin because you know that beat. Your old unit used it to signal a latch breach.

You force a breath. You push forward. The corridor sweats recycled air. Something sweet rides under the filters.

Your suit light hits a bulkhead. Someone scratched words into the paint with a tool. Fresh. All caps.

LATCH THE CHOIR.

Behind you, the airlock cycles on its own. The inner door starts to close.

### Turn 10 [PLAYER]

I slam my boot and forearm into the inner door, jamming it, and wedge a pry bar in the track. “Crew, sound off—who the hell just cycled the lock?” I raise my rifle down the corridor and advance, tracking that 3-short-1-long ping.

*Agent reasoning: The airlock is trying to seal me in and something’s moving; I need to stop the door and keep my escape route while I find the threat.*

### Turn 11 [GAME]

Your boot and forearm hit the inner door hard enough to shudder the frame. The motor keeps trying to pull it shut—metal whining—until you jam the pry bar into the track. It catches with a teeth-rattling *clack*. The door stops two handspans from sealing, trembling against the bar like it’s breathing.

Your comms squawk as you bark for a sound-off.

Static answers first. Then a voice—female, clipped, corporate calm—cuts in on a tightbeam you didn’t authorize: “Kade, step away from Helix property. That lock cycle was a safety interlock. You’re exhibiting escalation markers.”

Not your crew.

Your suit HUD flags the transmission as external relay, not ship-internal. Someone is listening from outside the hull—or through a repeater already on board.

You bring the rifle up and advance down the corridor. To your right, a maintenance hatch sits slightly proud of the wall, screws missing like they were backed out fast. A thin thread of sweet air leaks from its seam. Ahead, the amber strips pulse and your scanner repeats the pattern: three short, one long—now closer, and *offset* by a second echo, like a call-and-response.

Behind you, the jammed door *thunks* again as the motor retries, then stops. Something else takes over: a softer pressure, steady, pushing the door inward—like a hand on the other side testing your wedge.

From deeper in the ship, you hear the heavy impact again—one… two… then a scrape, as if something with weight is dragging itself along the deck plating, keeping low to avoid line of sight.

The Helix voice returns, quieter, almost coaxing: “Your contract doesn’t include independent entry. Confirm you have no additional personnel with you. Confirm you are not in possession of unlicensed data media.”

Your corridor light catches those wet handprints again—this time you see the directionality: fingers splayed *outward*, as if someone pressed from inside the wall.

**Status updates:**  
- Inner door: Jammed, resisting pressure  
- Helix tightbeam: Active, monitoring  
- Ping pattern: Closing, doubled

```

### Turn 12 [PLAYER]

I snap, “Go to hell, Helix—log this: I’m armed and I’m not leaving.” I pivot to the maintenance hatch and put two controlled shots into the seam/lock to blow it open, then swing back to the airlock and fire a burst through the narrowing gap at whatever’s pressing the door before moving down the corridor toward the doubled ping.

*Agent reasoning: Helix is trying to box me in and someone’s physically pushing the door—two threats. I need a hard fallback route and I’m not letting a crawler flank me through that hatch.*

### Turn 13 [GAME]

Your reply spits into the tightbeam. Helix doesn’t answer with anger—just a tiny pause, like a checkbox got ticked somewhere.

You pivot and put two controlled shots into the maintenance hatch seam. The rounds punch sparks and flake paint; the latch deforms and the panel kicks inward with a metallic cough. A gust of warmer air rolls out—sweet, chemical-sick—and it carries a faint, wet clicking like teeth tapping together in the dark.

You snap back to the airlock gap and fire a burst through the narrowing slit.

Immediate outcome: you hit *something*—not a clean metallic ping, not a suit-plating ring. It answers with a dull, meaty impact and a short, involuntary exhale that fogs the edge of the gap. The pressure on the door drops for half a second… then returns, lower and steadier, as if whatever’s out there changed grip rather than retreated.

Through the gap, your light catches a smear of skin-tone—fingers—pressed flat, knuckles bending the wrong way. No glove. No tool. Just hand.

The Helix operator comes back on, voice tightened now: “You just discharged in a controlled salvage lane. That’s breach-of-contract and grounds for containment. Kade—there are no authorized personnel on that hull. Whatever you’re engaging is not ours.” A beat. Then, quieter: “Your old unit’s callsigns are in the quarantine packet. Did you bring the wafer aboard?”

Down the corridor, the doubled ping resolves into two sources: one ahead and one *above you*, vibrating through the ductwork you just opened. Three short, one long—answered a half-second later, like something learning to mimic you. The heavy dragging scrape shifts closer, but it’s not on the main deckline anymore; it’s traveling through the walls, keeping pace.

Amber strips strobe. In that stutter, the wet handprints on the bulkhead look like they’re multiplying—overlapping, as if several sets pressed through at different depths.

**Status updates:**  
- Maintenance hatch: Blown open, venting sweet air  
- Airlock gap: Still jammed; pressure persists  
- Pings: Two sources; one in ducts  

```json
{"inventory_add":[],"inventory_remove":[],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":["Sable Accord - Main corridor (adjacent to maintenance hatch)"],"npcs_add":[]}
```

### Turn 14 [PLAYER]

“Shut up—quarantine packet my ass.” I yank a frag and drop it through the maintenance hatch, then backpedal down the corridor to widen distance and get a clean lane. As I move, I rip a strip of tape and lash the pry bar in place on the airlock jam so it can’t be shoved free, then I level the rifle up at the duct line and wait to hose whatever crawls out.

*Agent reasoning: Helix is fishing for info and something’s in the ducts trying to flank; I need space, kill lanes, and to stop the airlock thing from getting in behind me.*

### Turn 15 [GAME]

You rip the frag free and drop it into the maintenance hatch.

**Immediate outcome:** it doesn’t clatter down like an empty service trunk. It lands *soft*—a wet, muffled *thump*—like it hit insulation soaked in something that shouldn’t be there. The sweet chemical stink surges out harder, and with it comes a thin, choked vocalization from inside the duct line, cut off mid-breath.

You backpedal down the main corridor, boots sticking then releasing with tacky snaps. The amber strips strobe overhead; each pulse makes the handprints on the bulkhead look freshly glossed.

You slap tape around the pry bar and the door track—fast, ugly, functional. The inner airlock door shudders as pressure tests it again, but the bar holds; the tape bites into cold metal and starts to peel at the edges from the strain.

Up in the duct seam above you, the doubled ping accelerates—three short, one long—then *breaks rhythm* as if whatever’s making it is startled. Something scrapes metal-on-metal in the ventilation run, moving away from the hatch you just fed the grenade… and toward the grate above your rifle.

Helix tightbeam snaps back in, no longer coaxing: “We’re recording. Containment authorization is live. If you detonate ordnance in that hull, you will compromise the recorder and—” A second voice bleeds in under hers for half a second, distorted and devotional: “—don’t waste the opening—” then it’s gone, swallowed by static like it never existed.

The frag’s fuse hisses somewhere inside the ductwork—too loud in the staged silence—followed by a pressure change you feel in your teeth.

A pale mist begins to breathe out of the maintenance hatch behind you and crawl along the deckline, sugar-sweet and ozonic. Your visor/HUD starts painting brief, false motion ticks at the edge of your sight—flickers that don’t match your rifle’s light sweep.

Then the duct above you bows downward a fraction, screws whining. Something heavy is bracing to drop.

**Status updates:**  
- Frag: live, in duct line  
- Airlock jam: reinforced, holding  
- Sweet mist: spreading, irritant  
- Duct above: deforming, imminent breach

*Triggered: watcher_Hell_1_f7e8f2, fail_Hell_1_f1f030*

### Turn 16 [PLAYER]

I hold my breath, snap my visor filters to max, and dive hard to the side behind a bulkhead rib as the duct gives—rifle trained on the grate. The second anything drops, I hose it center-mass, then I surge forward down the corridor on the grenade’s concussion, moving fast toward the recorder route.

*Agent reasoning: Something’s about to drop out of the duct and the grenade is about to blow—staying here is asking to get pinned. I’ll use the blast to cover a push forward and avoid breathing that mist.*

### Turn 17 [GAME]

You clamp your breath, slam filters to max, and throw yourself behind a bulkhead rib just as the duct finally gives.

**Immediate outcome:** the grate tears loose—but nothing drops cleanly. Something *catches* on the lip, joints scraping, and hangs there for a heartbeat in your weapon light: a human shape folded wrong, bare hands hooked into sheet metal, skin mottled like it’s been drowned and dried and drowned again. Its head jerks toward the ping source like it’s listening to a conductor only it can hear.

You hose it center-mass. The rounds walk through sternum and shoulder; it spasms, but it doesn’t fall like a body. It *repositions*, dragging itself sideways into the duct run with a wet, efficient strength—leaving strips of skin on the torn edge. A dark fluid strings after it and snaps.

The frag goes off in the maintenance line behind you—more concussion than shrapnel in that confined trunk. The blast punches a hot gust down the corridor and the whole ship answers with a low, unhappy *gong*. Your filters whine as the sweet mist turns sharp and burnt.

And that’s when the world lurches.

The seam in the corridor—somewhere between the maintenance hatch and the airlock throat—hiccups. Gravity spikes *sideways* for a breath. Your body tries to follow it: shoulder and rifle yanked toward a micro-welded bulkhead. The deck-grip film blooms up your boots and calves like living adhesive, locking you mid-surge. The hull ticking speeds up, fast and irregular, like a countdown you can’t see.

Above, the thing in the duct scrapes away at speed, keeping pace with the doubled ping—now ahead and slightly left, deeper toward the ship’s spine. Behind you, the jammed airlock door shudders; your taped pry bar holds, but the tape begins to stretch and peel under the strain.

Helix tightbeam cuts in through your ear, breathless now: “Mass-field stutter—Kade, stop forcing seams. You’re in the anchor zone. If you get pinned there, we can’t pull you without—” Her voice is interrupted by a faint second channel, that devotional bleed again: “Latch… the choir… before it latches you.”

**Sensory grounding:** you’re down the main corridor, half-sheltered behind a rib; ductwork overhead is torn open, mist crawling along the deck toward your legs.

**Status updates**
- Frag: detonated, duct line compromised  
- Duct entity: wounded, retreated forward  
- Gravity: lateral spike, pinning risk  
- Deck film: climbing, boots adhered

*Triggered: watcher_Hell_1_f7e8f2, fail_Hell_1_f1f030, fail_-mass_1_60ea3c*

### Turn 18 [PLAYER]

I snarl, “Helix—tell me what the hell an ‘anchor zone’ is or I start shooting your repeaters.” I drop to a knee, jam the pry bar under the deck film at my boot and lever hard to peel it back, then slice any remaining tack with my knife. The second I’m free, I shoulder the rifle up at the torn duct and push forward fast, using the bulkhead ribs for cover and tracking the retreating scrape toward the spine.

*Agent reasoning: I’m getting pinned; I need mobility and to stop that adhesive creep fast. Fire won’t help in a sealed hull—use the pry bar as leverage, cut myself loose if needed, and keep pushing toward the recorder while threatening Helix for answers.*

### Turn 19 [GAME]

Your snarl rides the dead-channel hiss—and comes back at you half a beat late, doubled in your own voice, like the corridor is practicing your threat. The tightbeam clicks, then Helix answers too fast, like she was waiting for the right keywords.

“Anchor zone is a mass-stabilization corridor,” the operator says, words clipped. “Helix retrofits them into black-site hulls. If the ship’s field hiccups, the anchor grabs *you* before it lets the structure shear. It’s supposed to keep crews alive. It also keeps them… *in place.* Don’t fire into the lighting bus—those ‘repeaters’ are tied into the auxiliary mass grid.”

Behind your knee, the deck film has climbed to your boot like tar with intent. You jam the pry bar under the edge and lever. It peels with a wet tearing sound, stretching into translucent strands that snap back at your glove. Your knife saws through the last tack; a sting of heat runs up your ankle as the film tries to re-bond, then you rip free. The adhesive leaves a dark, handprint-like residue on the sole.

You shoulder the rifle and push forward, ribs of bulkhead giving you staggered cover. The torn duct overhead coughs a thin drip—dark fluid pattering on the deck. The retreating scrape is ahead now, deeper toward the spine, fast and *quiet* except when it hits a junction and the whole run rings like a tuning fork.

As you pass the smeared handprints on the wall, your light catches something underneath the grime: a partially burned **Helix microstamp** and a short numeric string, heat-warped but legible in places—after-report chain formatting, the kind that follows boarding actions that “never happened.” Someone tried to scrub it with flame and only bruised it into permanence.

The airlock behind you slams once against your taped pry bar—hard enough to make the tape shriek. Above, the duct scrape pauses, then answers with the same three-short-one-long ping you heard earlier… but it’s off by a fraction now, like it’s learning to fake timing.

Helix tightbeam drops to a lower, almost reluctant tone: “Kade—if you’re going to the recorder route, it’s through the spine access. But if the anchor zone re-triggers, you’ll stick again. Keep moving and stop talking on open band.”

**Status updates:**  
- Boots: freed, residue left  
- Anchor zone: confirmed Helix retrofit  
- Microstamp: partially legible chain ID  
- Duct entity: ahead, mimicking ping

### Turn 20 [PLAYER]

I snap a quick pic of the Helix microstamp/string and mutter, “Heard you. Spine access, now.” I slap my last strip of tape sticky-side up on the deck under the torn duct as a tell, then move hard toward spine access with the rifle up, sweeping ribs-to-ribs and firing the moment that mimic ping gets too close.

*Agent reasoning: Helix just admitted the anchor grid can pin me; I need the spine access fast, but I’m not letting that duct-thing shadow me. I’ll grab the microstamp for leverage and set a nasty surprise for anything dropping from above while I push.*

### Turn 22 [PLAYER]

I push hard toward spine access, rifle up, sweeping cover-to-cover along the bulkhead ribs. If anything breaks from the torn duct or that mimic ping closes, I fire a tight burst and keep moving—what do I see/hear right now?

*Agent reasoning: Blank prompt smells like a glitch or hidden transition; I’m not waiting around. I’ll push for spine access while staying ready to shoot anything that drops from the duct, and I’ll demand clarification if the environment isn’t being described.*

### Turn 23 [GAME]

You drive forward ribs-to-ribs, rifle tight, letting the bulkhead frames swallow you and spit you out in short, controlled sprints.

**Immediate outcome:** the mimic ping closes—too fast—then snaps to your left, above you. The torn duct **vomits** a pale, jointed forearm and a piece of shredded sleeve. You fire a tight burst on reflex. The rounds punch into the duct lip and whatever’s behind it; the arm flails, then retracts so hard it leaves a wet strip along the metal. The ping stutters—once, twice—then goes silent.

Your boot hits the strip of tape you planted sticky-side up under the duct. It’s already got a thin dusting of dark grit on it…and a **clear, gelatinous smear** across the adhesive, like something brushed it while you weren’t looking.

**Sensory grounding:** you’re halfway down the main corridor toward spine access; amber strips pulse overhead, and the air tastes scorched-sweet from the blown maintenance line.

The deck fights you again—subtle, not a full lock. That tacky centerline sheen thickens and **tugs at your soles** with each step, strongest near a hairline crack venting that faint sweetness. Along the wall edges the pull is weaker; your boots peel free easier when you hug the ribs.

Helix tightbeam hisses, then the operator comes back quieter, strained: “Good shooting. But it’s not just in the duct—your deck’s blooming polymer coolant. If it grabs you during a stutter, you’ll pin. Stay off the centerline.”

As if to underline it, the hull ticks accelerate and a low bass *thud* travels through the corridor from ahead—spine direction—heavy enough to rattle dust from cable trays. Something else answers it: a distant, human-ish **knuckle-rap** on metal, three short, one long, now coming from *inside the walls*, not the duct.

Spine access is visible ahead: a circular hatch with a manual wheel, smeared with fresh handprints. Beside it, a Helix service placard has been peeled back; underneath is a scratched warning in grease pencil: **DON’T LET IT HEAR YOU COUNT.**

**Status updates:**
- Duct contact: driven back, wounded
- Tape tell: gelatin smear collected
- Deck film: thickening at centerline
- Spine hatch: in sight, marked

### Turn 24 [PLAYER]

I hug the wall edge to avoid the tacky centerline, rifle up, and plant myself on the spine hatch. “Helix—how do I pop this wheel fast, and what’s on the other side?” I crank hard; if it resists, I slam the pry bar into the wheel spokes for leverage and force it open, then snap the muzzle into the gap ready to fire.

*Agent reasoning: I’m not standing in a sticky kill corridor while something learns my signals. Get through the spine hatch fast, keep off the centerline, and be ready to shoot whatever tries to follow.*

### Turn 25 [GAME]

You flatten to the wall edge, boots peeling cleanly off the less-sticky strip by the ribs, and get both hands on the spine hatch wheel.

Helix tightbeam answers in your ear, breath audible like she’s jogging somewhere: “Wheel is manual dog-clutch. Fastest is quarter-turn to break the seal, then back it off. Don’t fully rip it—spine sections sit on uneven pressure. Other side is the Line access trunk: ladderwell, cable runs, and a pressure baffle before the recorder corridor. If you hear whistling, stop.”

You crank hard anyway. The wheel resists—old seal, fresh grime—so you jam the pry bar through the spokes and heave.

The hatch *gives* with a metallic scream.

And the ship punishes you for it.

Air snaps toward the widening seam with a sudden, violent **decompression whip**. Dust, insulation flakes, and sweet-stink grit blast out like a sandblaster. Your rifle jerks toward the gap; the pull tries to drag your forearms and chest into the seam, boots skidding as the deck film finally gets leverage on you.

For a half-second you see through the crack: a dark ladderwell, loose cabling floating like weeds—and something pale stuck to the far bulkhead, twitching in the airflow like a drowned hand.

The corridor fills with a fog of grit. It rasps across your visor and throat; it *hurts* to inhale.

Helix barks, sharp now: “Kade—seal it! That’s a pocket! You open it wide you’ll get pinned and flayed—use tape or crack-and-bleed!”

The knuckle-rap inside the walls answers immediately, closer than it should be, three short one long, timed to your struggling breaths like it’s counting for you. Above, in the torn duct run behind, something scrapes fast—coming in on the noise and the pressure change.

**Status updates**
- Spine hatch: cracked open, uncontrolled bleed  
- Corridor: grit fog, cutting stream  
- Deck film: pulling at boots  
- Wall-rap: closer, “counting” cadence

### Turn 26 [PLAYER]

“Copy—crack-and-bleed.” I slam my palm over the seam to narrow it and shove tape across the gap in two fast bands to choke the airflow, then I back the wheel a hair to stabilize pressure. As soon as the pull eases, I rip the tape, wrench the hatch open just enough to slip in, and dive into the ladderwell with the rifle up, firing downrange at anything pale that twitches.

*Agent reasoning: The decompression and deck film will pin me if I fight the hatch wide open. I need to control the bleed fast, then push through before the duct thing arrives.*

### Turn 27 [GAME]

You palm the seam, choke it down to a thin hiss, and slap two tape bands across the gap. The airflow drops from a yank to a hard, steady pull; your boots stop skating. You back the wheel a fraction—just enough—and the hatch settles with a complaining *clunk* as the pressure equalizes into a manageable bleed.

**Immediate outcome:** the decompression whip eases. The grit fog thins from a blasting cloud to a drifting haze. The wall-rap pauses—like whatever was “counting” just lost its place.

You rip the tape, wrench the hatch open to a shoulder-width slit, and slip through.

Inside the spine access trunk it’s colder and quieter, the sound dampened by insulation and bundled cable. A ladderwell drops straight down along the ship’s spine; cable looms float and sway in the residual draft like kelp. The pale thing you glimpsed is there—stuck to the far bulkhead across the shaft: not a hand. A **pressure-bloated glove** with bone-white fingers inside it, trapped under a strip of torn mesh. It twitches only because the air is still moving.

You dive onto the ladder rungs, rifle up, and fire downrange at the “twitch.”

The burst shreds the glove and punches sparks off a junction box behind it. The trunk lights stutter—then go out entirely. For a heartbeat you’re in black, lit only by your muzzle flash and the afterimage of the shaft.

In that strobing light, something *else* moves below—not pale, but **wet-black**, clinging to the ladder’s underside and sliding away from the flashes, fast and silent. It doesn’t come at you; it retreats into a side conduit and is gone.

Helix tightbeam crackles, signal weaker through the spine shielding: “—Kade? I lost you for a sec. That shot hit a junction. Your trunk lights are dead. Don’t keep firing blind—there’s a baffle down there; if you perforate it you’ll open another pocket.”

Above you, back through the hatch slit, the torn duct scrape returns—closer, excited by the muzzle report. Something taps the hatch rim from the corridor side, testing the opening you just made.

**Status updates**
- Spine hatch: stabilized, passable slit  
- Spine trunk: lights out, comms weaker  
- Junction box: damaged, sparking  
- Movement below: wet-black retreat spotted

### Turn 28 [PLAYER]

I kick the hatch with my boot to slam it mostly shut, then jam the pry bar through the wheel spokes to hold it and buy me time. “Helix, give me a map of this trunk—where’s the nearest baffle and recorder corridor?” I click on my weapon light and start descending fast, muzzle angled down toward that side conduit the wet-black thing vanished into.

*Agent reasoning: I’m boxed in between something at the hatch and something moving below; I need to deny the hatch and take the fight down where I have space. Lights are out, so I’ll use my own light and stop wasting rounds.*

### Turn 29 [GAME]

You kick the hatch—metal rings through the trunk—and it swings mostly shut with a sucking *whump* as the last pressure differential dies. You jam the pry bar through the wheel spokes; it bites and holds. The testing taps from the corridor side turn into a frustrated scrape, then stop.

Weapon light clicks on. A hard white cone cuts down the ladderwell: rungs, drifting cable loops, and the side conduit where the wet-black thing vanished—an oval service throat with its grille torn out from the *inside*.

Helix comes back, voice compressed and glitchy through the spine shielding. “Trunk map is degraded—Sable’s internal beacons are dead. But standard spine layout: first baffle is one deck down, starboard side, marked with a yellow hazard chevron. Recorder corridor branches two decks down, port—look for the old audit placards and a double-run fiber bundle. If you see a white ceramic panel with Helix microstamps, you’re close.”

As you descend fast, the ladder transmits a faint vibration—like someone plucked it. Not from your weight. From below. The wet-black movement is back: your light catches a smear of sheen sliding along the conduit edge, staying just outside the beam, hugging the shadow where the cable bundle makes a dark seam.

Then the adhesive “nest” you dodged above shows its cousin down here: thin, clear strands stretch between rungs and cable as you pass, almost invisible until your light hits them and they sparkle. One brushes your sleeve and *sticks*, not strong enough to stop you, but enough to start pulling threads toward your wrist joint.

Behind you, the hatch wheel ticks once under the pry bar—something up there leans on it, testing. The bar holds, but the sound says you bought time, not safety.

The sparking junction you shot earlier keeps throwing intermittent arcs; each snap makes the trunk’s shadows jump, and each snap seems to make the wet-black thing freeze, then move again when the sound dies.

**Status updates**
- Spine hatch: barred, holding (for now)
- Trunk: weapon light only
- Adhesive strands: contact on sleeve

### Turn 30 [PLAYER]

I curse and rip my sleeve free, then rake the stuck strands with my combat knife to cut them loose. I pop a short burst into the conduit lip to make it back off, then stomp down the ladder hard and fast toward the yellow-chevron baffle—“Helix, if that thing hates arcs, tell me how to make more sparks down here.”

*Agent reasoning: That wet-black thing is stalking the shadows and the strands are trying to snag me; I’m not getting webbed on a ladder. I’ll burn the strands off and force the thing into the light with noise, then push hard to the baffle.*

### Turn 31 [GAME]

You tear your sleeve free with a wet *snap*—it leaves a translucent filament webbing behind, stretching, then recoiling onto the rung like saliva. The knife makes it cleaner: two fast rakes and the strands part, curling away from the blade as if they don’t like the metal’s edge.

You pop a short burst into the conduit lip.

**Immediate outcome:** the rounds chew the oval throat, spitting bright fragments and a fan of sparks. The wet-black sheen flinches hard—recoils deeper into the conduit, fast enough your light only catches a trailing gloss like oil on water. But the burst also punches into something energized: the ladderwell fills with the stink of scorched insulation, and a new, angry arcing starts somewhere below—irregular, hungry.

You stomp down hard, fast—rungs thudding under your boots, the whole spine turning into a resonator. The yellow-chevron baffle comes into view on the starboard bulkhead: a squat pressure door with a manual lever and a knee-high service junction box beside it, its cover half-melted and twitching with intermittent blue-white snaps.

Helix tightbeam crackles in your ear, voice tight with equal parts urgency and liability: “Don’t ride the main bus, Kade. If you want sparks, use local—those service boxes are meant for hot-swaps. Pop the cover, *don’t* grab the copper—use your knife to bridge from the casing to a live lug for a flash. Short it, then move. And—listen—if the trunk lights died from your shot, Helix hardware is still on the recorder side. White ceramic panels, microstamped. They carry their own power.”

As she speaks, something answers from the conduit above you—not a voice, a *pressure click* like joints flexing. The wet-black thing is moving again, staying in the ladder’s underside shadow, tracking your descent toward the baffle and the arcing box like it wants you near the electricity but not *too* near.

Behind, up the shaft, the barred hatch wheel ticks again—this time with a heavier push. The pry bar holds, but the metal complains.

**Status updates**

- Conduit entity: driven back, still shadowing

### Turn 32 [PLAYER]

I plant on the rungs level with the service box, shove my rifle in tight, and flick my knife out. I jam the blade from the box casing to a live lug to throw a violent flash, then immediately yank the baffle lever and slip through, swinging the weapon light and muzzle back up at the ladderwell in case the wet-black thing lunges. “Helix—door’s open; if it follows, how do I kill it fast?”

*Agent reasoning: I’m not letting that thing herd me—use the arcing box as a weapon, then get through the baffle fast before the hatch gives and I’m boxed in.*

### Turn 33 [GAME]

The knife tip bites the lug—

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the service box detonates in a brutal, blue-white flash. The crack is loud enough to feel in your teeth. For a split second the ladderwell is a negative image: cable bundles as black veins, your own hands as skeletal silhouettes.

In that strobe, the wet-black thing is *there*—unfurled under the rungs above you like a sheet of oil with too many joints. The flash makes it cinch up hard, not quite a retreat—more like a reflexive spasm—and it lets go of the ladder for a heartbeat.

You use that heartbeat. You yank the baffle lever; the door fights, then slams inward with a pressure-squeal. You slip through and shoulder it, weapon light snapping up the ladderwell as you swing your muzzle to cover the opening.

You’re now in the **baffle compartment**: a short, cramped cross-passage off the spine, starboard side. The air tastes drier here, more filtered, and the walls are lined with old foam panels that have gone brittle—your light catches dust drifting like ash.

Behind you, in the baffle doorway, the ladderwell is a vertical throat of darkness. Something slick drags across the threshold, testing. It doesn’t rush you—yet—but a thin strand of that clear adhesive stretches from the lip to the deck, trembling like a tripline.

Helix answers, breathing audible under their comm discipline. “Fast kill? I don’t have a confirmed biology. But it reacts to arcing—either pain or disruption. Use **electrical shock and fragmentation**. Keep it off your joints. If it gets on you, don’t pull—cut and burn. And Kade—if you can seal a pressure door behind it, do it. Containment beats heroics.”

As she talks, the ruined service box back in the trunk keeps popping intermittently—your short created a continuing fault. Each arc makes the slick shape twitch at the doorway, like it’s being forced to choose between following you and avoiding the noise.

Somewhere above, the barred hatch gives a heavy *clang*—a full-body hit this time. The pry bar is still holding, but the sound says whoever’s up there has stopped “testing” and started trying to come through.

**Status updates**
- Service box: sustained arcing fault

### Turn 34 [PLAYER]

I slam the baffle lever hard to seal it and dog it shut, then I knife the adhesive tripline at the threshold and back off a step with the rifle trained on the seam. “Helix, I’m sealing it—guide me to recorder corridor, now. And tell me what’s hitting that hatch.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m not letting either threat box me in—seal the baffle to contain the wet-black thing, then move toward the recorder corridor before whoever’s at the hatch breaks through.*

### Turn 35 [GAME]

You slam the lever down and dog it—hard. The baffle door shudders as the seals bite, then settles into a tight, metallic *thunk* that you feel through your shoulder. For half a second something slick presses from the other side, smearing the seam; the pressure fades as the sustained arcing in the trunk pops again. Whatever it is, it doesn’t like being trapped with that noise.

You knife the adhesive tripline at the threshold. It parts with a soft, elastic recoil and snaps back under the door edge like it’s trying to re-knit itself—but the cut holds. You back off one step, rifle steady on the seam. Your weapon light paints the door’s perimeter gasket a stark white, showing fresh wet streaks already drying to a dull sheen.

**Where you are:** starboard baffle cross-passage, just off the spine trunk. The foam-lined walls here drink sound; the only loud thing now is your own breathing and the distant, irregular *clang* echoing down the ladderwell behind the sealed door.

Helix comes on tightbeam immediately, voice strained. “Good seal. Keep it dogged—those baffles are rated for pressure events. Recorder corridor is **two decks down, port side**. In this compartment you should have a cross-passage—follow it to the **port access notch**, then you’ll find a secondary ladder drop. Look for **old audit placards**—black text, Helix triangle—and a **double-run fiber bundle** tied with white clips. If the ship’s maps are lying, the fiber won’t.”

You hear them typing, then: “What’s hitting the hatch—unknown. No biometrics. The impacts are *too regular* for hull shift, too heavy for a loose locker. Could be an EVA tool. Could be a person in a suit. Could be something using the ship like an instrument.” A beat. “I can’t see through bulkheads, Kade. But that hatch is on the same vertical line as you. Whatever it is, it’s tracking your position by sound.”

As if to underline it, the sealed baffle door gives a deep, muffled **bang** from the trunk side—different from the hatch above. Closer. Testing the seal now. The arcing behind it answers with a sharp crackle, and the bang doesn’t repeat.

Down the cross-passage, your light catches a smear of **white ceramic** at knee height—microstamped paneling, newer than the rest of the ship. Helix hardware, exactly like the operator said. It’s scuffed, as if someone recently slid something heavy past it.

**Status updates**
- Baffle door: sealed, dogged

### Turn 36 [PLAYER]

I move off the door and hustle down the cross-passage, sweeping my light low over that white ceramic panel for a latch, port, or stamped marking. “Helix, I’m on your ceramic—any hidden access or power tap here?” If it’s just a marker, I keep moving for the port access notch and the secondary ladder drop, rifle up and light cutting corners.

*Agent reasoning: The wet-black thing is contained for the moment, but something else is tracking me by sound from above. I need the recorder corridor fast, and that Helix ceramic panel might be power or a clue—I'll check it quickly, then move for the port access notch and ladder down.*

### Turn 37 [GAME]

You peel off the sealed baffle and hustle down the starboard cross-passage, keeping your light low. The foam panels here mute your footfalls; the only sound is the distant, dull percussion from above and the faint electrical *tick* bleeding through the bulkheads.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the white ceramic isn’t just a marker. Up close, your beam catches a hairline seam and a microstamp—Helix’s triangle nested inside a serial string. There’s a **flush service latch** disguised as a scuff-guard strip. When you press your thumb along it, it gives a tiny mechanical *click* like a spring detent… but it doesn’t open on pressure alone. No obvious port face—Helix made it “tool-only.”

Your light rakes the ceramic and finds **two pinholes** at the lower edge—optic and mic-sized—angled to watch the passage. They’re dark right now, but the glass has fresh wipe marks, like someone cleaned them recently.

Helix tightbeam comes back fast. “That’s an **audit tap panel**. Hidden access, yes. Power tap, yes—low draw. It’ll open with a keyed shim or a flat pry if you don’t care about leaving evidence.” A pause that’s almost a wince. “Inside should be a ceramic fuse block and a fiber coupler. If you bridge it, you can steal a trickle and you can also *see* if Helix has an active node deeper in—if it’s live, your presence is already logged.”

As you keep moving, the passage bends toward port. Your light cuts the corner and finds the **port access notch**: a squared recess with a secondary ladder drop—painted safety stripes half-flaked away—and a bundled **double-run fiber** lashed with white clips, exactly like Helix said.

Behind you, through the bulkhead, the baffle door gives a soft, sustained **scrape**—not a bang. Something dragging itself along the other side, feeling for gaps. The arcing in the trunk has quieted to intermittent pops, farther apart now, like the fault is dying down.

Down the ladder notch, cool air rises in a steady draft that smells cleaner—closer to “maintained” than “derelict.”

**Status updates**
- Helix ceramic: audit tap panel found  
- Watch pinholes: present, recently wiped  
- Port access notch: reached

### Turn 38 [PLAYER]

I jam my pry bar into the audit panel seam and rip it open, then shine my light inside and yank whatever looks like a portable power tap or fuse block I can use. “Helix—tell me what’s on this coupler right now; is there a live node or someone else on your line?”  

Then I swing to the port access notch and start dropping the secondary ladder fast, rifle slung tight and muzzle angled down.

*Agent reasoning: Someone’s been here recently and Helix is watching; I want the recorder corridor fast, but I also need power/sparks and intel. I’ll brute the audit panel open, grab anything useful, then drop the port ladder before the thing finds a way through.*

### Turn 39 [GAME]

You wedge the pry bar into the ceramic seam and twist until the panel gives with a sharp **crack**—not ceramic breaking, but the hidden latch shearing. The cover pops loose and swings out on a tether, shedding a puff of fine white dust that tastes like chalk and ozone.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** inside is a compact Helix audit bay: a **ceramic fuse block** (thumb-sized breakers), a **fiber coupler** with a status strip, and a flat **induction tap puck** velcroed to the backplate with a short lead. The status strip is lit—dim green—meaning it’s powered and passing signal. You yank the tap puck free; the velcro tears loud in the muffled corridor. When you pull, the coupler’s light flickers and drops from green to amber, like you just introduced loss on the line.

Helix tightbeam operator goes very still for half a beat, then their voice tightens. “You just hit an active audit splice. Yes—there’s a live node downstream. No—*it’s not ours alone*.” You hear rapid keystrokes. “I’m seeing a second handshake signature on that coupler. Not Freejack standard. Not Helix field kit. It’s… riding the line like a parasite. If it notices the drop you created, it may start polling for the break—meaning it’ll know *exactly* where you are.”

Behind you, through bulkheads, the scraping at the dogged baffle stops. In the sudden quiet, the hatch impacts above sound louder—two heavy blows, then a pause, like whoever’s up there is listening too.

You don’t linger. You swing to the **port access notch** and drop onto the secondary ladder fast, rifle slung tight, muzzle angled down. The draft here is colder and cleaner; your light catches the double-run fiber bundle descending with you, white clips flashing like teeth in the dark. Half a deck down, you pass another Helix microstamp plate—this one has a faint **greasy handprint** across it, recent.

Helix comes back in your ear, lower now. “Recorder corridor is still two decks down. If that parasite is what I think, it’ll try to route you—false signage, false pings. Trust physical fiber runs and pressure-door placards, not the ship’s UI.”

**Status updates**

### Turn 40 [PLAYER]

I keep dropping fast, then stop at that greasy handprint plate and wipe it with my glove, sniffing for suit grease or coolant—then I slap the induction tap puck onto the plate and let it ride as a dumb beacon. “Helix, I’m not playing maze games—mark the next physical placard to recorder corridor and keep chatter short; if that parasite pings, I want the direction.” Then I continue down toward the next deck, rifle ready, light cutting the ladderwell below.

*Agent reasoning: There’s a live “parasite” on Helix fiber and something else is physically here (greasy handprint). I’m not getting herded by fake routing—push straight to recorder corridor while planting a nasty surprise and keeping comms minimal.*

### Turn 41 [GAME]

You keep sliding down the ladder fast, then brake hard at the microstamp plate with the greasy handprint.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** your glove smears the print instead of lifting it clean. It’s not thick suit grease—it’s a thin, waxy film with a faint **sweet-coolant** note under the metal tang, like degraded thermal paste mixed with something organic. It clings to your glove in strings that don’t quite snap right away.

You slap the induction tap puck onto the plate. It adheres with a firm magnetic bite and a tiny vibration as it finds coupling. The puck’s indicator gives a single dim pulse—enough to say it’s drawing and broadcasting, but not “talking” in any smart way. A dumb beacon, like you wanted.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re halfway down the port ladder drop, one deck below the baffle cross-passage. The ladderwell is a narrow square shaft; your light falls straight down into drifting dust that looks like slow snow.

Helix tightbeam answers clipped. “Copy. Next physical placard should be **SPINE-2 / RECORDER SERVICE**—stenciled on a pressure door frame, black on bare alloy. We can’t ‘mark’ it remotely without lighting up the whole lane, but I can feed you the stencil format Helix used that year. Short chatter.” Their breathing is audible now, like they’ve moved closer to a mic.

Then the operator goes quiet mid-sentence. A faint electronic *warble* creeps into your comm—like a modem trying to sing through a throat full of static.

“—It’s pinging,” Helix says, voice lower. “Directionality’s bad through this hull, but the poll is **coming from below you**, not behind. It’s using the ship’s fiber trunks like nerves. Your beacon just gave it a taste.”

As you continue down, your light catches something else: a **cable tie** on the fiber bundle has been freshly replaced—white clip too clean, edges sharp. And below that, on a rung, there’s a shallow dent with a crescent of scraped paint—recent boot impact, someone moving fast in the same direction.

Far above, the heavy hatch impacts stop. The silence up there feels like a decision.

### Turn 42 [PLAYER]

I barehand the rung with my clean glove, drop the rest of the way in a controlled slide, and come off the ladder hard—rifle up, light sweeping the deck and corners. “Helix—ping’s from below, I heard it; stay quiet unless you’ve got distance and direction.” I move toward the nearest pressure door frame looking for **SPINE-2 / RECORDER SERVICE**, then plant on the hinge-side and listen before I touch anything.

*Agent reasoning: Something’s below and someone moved this way recently; I’m not waiting to get ambushed on a ladder. I’ll get off the shaft fast and take the fight on my terms, while keeping Helix’s comm clean.*

### Turn 43 [GAME]

You swap to the clean glove, barehand the rung, and drop the rest of the shaft in a controlled slide. You hit the deck hard—boots thud, knees flex—rifle comes up as your light knifes across the new level.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the deck is not empty. Your beam catches a **pressure-door frame** ten meters ahead with the stencil you were hunting: **SPINE-2 / RECORDER SERVICE** in black on bare alloy—Helix font, same year as the microstamp. The door itself is shut, but not fully seated; it’s **latched** with a finger-width gap, like someone pulled it almost closed to kill light and sound without sealing.

You plant hinge-side, shoulder to the cold frame, and listen.

From the gap: a soft, rhythmic **click… click… click**—not footsteps. More like a relay cycling, or something tapping the inside of the door with a tool. Beneath it, a whisper of air moving the wrong way: the compartment beyond is at a slightly different pressure, pulling at the crack.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re at the bottom of the port access notch ladderwell, facing a short service corridor that angles toward the ship’s spine; the air here is cleaner, but laced with that faint sweet-coolant note.

Your comm stays quiet—Helix obeys—until a single, tight murmur: “Copy. No chatter.” Then the line hisses once, like something brushed the band and moved on.

Your light sweep finds two more active threads in the periphery: on the deck to your left, a **dropped cable clip tool** (cheap polymer, fresh scuffs) lies near the fiber run—whoever replaced that tie did it in a hurry. And on the right bulkhead, a **handwritten arrow** in grease points toward the recorder door, but the arrowhead is split into two prongs—deliberately ambiguous, like it was meant to steer someone wrong.

The pressure door’s hinge housing is wet with condensation… except for one **dry streak** where something recently slid along it, wiping moisture away.

**STATUS UPDATES**

### Turn 44 [PLAYER]

I scoop up the dropped cable clip tool and flick it down the corridor away from the door to make a sharp clatter, then I snap my rifle tight on the gap. “Recorder room—hands where I can see ‘em. Open it slow or I’m coming through.” If nothing answers, I kick the door hard at the latch to blow it open and flow in muzzle-first.

*Agent reasoning: Someone’s in there or something’s working; the door’s not sealed and there’s pressure draw, so I want control of the threshold fast. I’ll use force, but I’ll bait a reaction first and be ready to shoot.*

### Turn 45 [GAME]

You scoop the dropped cable-clip tool and flick it hard down-corridor.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** it skitters, then *cracks* off a bulkhead with a sharp clatter that echoes up the ladderwell. The clicking behind the recorder door stops instantly—like a hand froze mid-motion.

You snap your rifle to the gap. “Recorder room—hands where I can see ‘em. Open it slow or I’m coming through.”

No answer. Not even breathing.

You kick the latch.

The door blows inward with a metallic bark and a gust of colder air that smells of ionized dust and that same sweet coolant note—stronger now. You flow in muzzle-first, light stabbing across the compartment.

The room is a narrow service bay wrapped around a recorder access stack—Helix-spec shielding, black ceramic panels. Someone’s been **inside the recorder service cradle**: a side panel hangs half-off, and a fiber lead is looped wrong, like it was rushed back into place.

But there’s no tech standing over it.

Instead, your light catches movement low and fast: a **maintenance crawler** (one of those palm-sized inspection rigs) darts under the recorder rack, dragging a thin filament behind it like a tail. The filament isn’t standard fiber—too dark, too matte—and it disappears into a hairline seam in the deck plating as if the floor is swallowing it.

At the back of the bay, the far bulkhead has fresh grease writing smeared into the condensation: **LATCH // THE // CHOIR**—not carved, not old. Wet.

From your comm, Helix tightbeam operator whispers despite your order, voice strained. “Rhea—your beacon just went dead. Like it got… *answered.* I’m getting a return path from your position now. Something in that room is coupling to the line.”

Behind you in the corridor, the tool you threw stops making noise—too abruptly—like something picked it up or pinned it.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re inside SPINE-2 / RECORDER SERVICE, just past the breached pressure door; the hinge-side offers partial cover, but the room is tight and full of hard angles that throw your light back in shards.

**STATUS UPDATES**

### Turn 46 [PLAYER]

I pivot, slam the pressure door back toward closed to cut the corridor off, then whip back and stomp hard where the crawler vanished under the recorder rack. “Helix—shut up. If you’ve got a kill-switch for this recorder stack, use it now.”

*Agent reasoning: Something’s in the walls and using the fiber; I’m not letting that crawler finish whatever it’s doing, and I’m not getting flanked from the corridor.*

### Turn 47 [GAME]

You pivot and slam the pressure door back toward closed. It catches—almost—then **rebounds** a few centimeters as if something in the corridor shoulders it from the other side. The latch doesn’t seat. Metal squeals softly in complaint.

You whip back and stomp where the crawler vanished under the recorder rack.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** your boot hits deckplate and the rack’s lower brace—hard enough to jar the whole stack. Something **crunches** beneath, but it isn’t clean plastic; it’s more like you crushed a shell full of grit. A thin, matte filament snaps taut for a heartbeat under the rack, then **zips** away into the deck seam like a fishing line yanked from your hand. The sweet coolant stink spikes, and your visor flashes a brief static shimmer—like the room blinked.

Under the rack, your light catches the crawler’s remains: half a casing, cracked open, **empty**—as if the important part was never the chassis.

“Helix—shut up. If you’ve got a kill-switch for this recorder stack, use it now.”

The tightbeam operator answers anyway, voice clipped and scared. “We don’t have a kill-switch. Not remotely. We can hard-drop power to the *bay* if the ship’s bus is alive—big if—and it’ll also lock the pressure door mag. You’ll be in the dark with a sealed door and whatever’s in there with you.”

As they speak, the recorder stack emits a faint **choral harmonic**—not audio through speakers, more like the shielding panels themselves are vibrating. The grease writing on the back bulkhead beads and runs as if warmed from within.

Behind you, the pressure door gap widens another finger-width with a steady shove. Something outside drags the tossed cable-clip tool along the deck—slow metal-on-metal—testing the sound.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re inside the SPINE-2 Recorder Service Bay, hinge-side of the pressure door at your back; the recorder rack is directly ahead, its underside now shadowed and close.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Door: won’t latch shut  
- Crawler: crushed casing, “core” gone

### Turn 48 [PLAYER]

I whirl to the pressure door, plant a boot on the frame, and rip it open hard, rifle leveled at chest height. “Step in or back off—now!” If I see a target, I fire center mass; if I don’t, I snatch the cable-clip tool and back into the bay, keeping my muzzle on the corridor while I look for a manual power cut or breaker on the recorder rack.

*Agent reasoning: Something’s forcing the door and there’s a parasite in the recorder stack; I’m not letting it trap me in the dark. I’ll confront whoever’s outside and keep my exit.*

### Turn 49 [GAME]

You wrench the pressure door open with your boot braced on the frame, rifle leveled.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the corridor beyond is *empty*—no body, no suit light—just amber strips and the wet handprints on the bulkhead. But the moment the door clears, the ship answers like it’s been waiting: the hull’s irregular ticking **accelerates into a rapid metronome**, and the air in the corridor *drops out*.

A pressure differential catches the open doorway and **knifes a hard wind through the gap**. The corridor plating flexes with a gunshot crack—metal whipping like a stressed rib. Loose grit and flakes of paint lift and turn into stinging shrapnel. Your boots skid as the deck’s resin film turns slick, trying to drag you toward the opening like the ship is exhaling you.

Down the corridor, something heavy hits once—**a deliberate impact**—as if whatever’s out there just leaned into the new airflow to feel it.

Your shout—“Step in or back off—now!”—is half-torn away by the rush.

In the strobing light, your beam sweeps the smeared handprints and for the first time you notice the pattern: not random panic marks. Under your light’s UV edge, they resolve into a **rescue-sign sequence**, each smear angled to point—*not* to the recorder bay, but to a low, recessed panel on the starboard wall: a **maintenance equalization valve**. Freejack code. A warning somebody left for the next idiot who forced a seal.

You don’t see a target, so you snatch the cable-clip tool from where it’s been dragged—cold, wet—then backstep into the bay, muzzle holding the corridor while you search the recorder rack.

The rack has a manual cutoff: a red, flip-guarded breaker block labeled **RECORDER SERVICE / AUX BUS**. But the airflow is still tearing through the door and the rack’s harmonic is getting louder, vibrating your teeth.

On comm, Helix’s operator blurts, “That pressure swing—Rhea, don’t—” then cuts off into a burst of harmonics, like the line itself is singing back.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re half in the recorder bay, half in the doorway; the equalization valve is visible in the corridor starboard wall, three meters out, while the breaker block sits on the recorder rack at your left shoulder.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Seal breach cascade: active  
- Equalization valve: located (Freejack-marked)

### Turn 50 [PLAYER]

I lunge out into the corridor against the wind and slam the maintenance equalization valve open, then immediately dive back into the bay and flip the RECORDER SERVICE / AUX BUS breaker to hard-cut power. “Helix—if you can hear me, stay off the line.”

*Agent reasoning: The pressure differential is the immediate killer—if I don’t equalize, I’ll get dragged or the corridor will rip. Kill power second to stop whatever’s coupling through the recorder stack.*

### Turn 51 [GAME]

You lunge into the corridor against the screaming wind and slap the recessed maintenance equalization valve.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** it takes both hands and your whole weight, but the valve wheel gives—then *spins* a quarter turn with a wet, gritty grind. The pressure differential collapses in a single ugly gulp. The wind dies so fast your ears pop and your stomach lurches; paint flakes and grit rain straight down instead of streaming.

For half a second, in that sudden stillness, you hear something you didn’t before: a soft, satisfied *click* from inside the starboard wall—like a small mechanism finishing a recording.

You dive back into the recorder bay and flip the **RECORDER SERVICE / AUX BUS** breaker.

The bay goes dead. Amber strips stutter once and extinguish; your rifle light becomes the only hard illumination. The recorder rack’s vibration stops mid-note, leaving a silence that feels pressurized, staged.

In the dark, a tiny point of red appears high near the doorframe—faint, intermittent, like a status LED trying not to be seen. It winks off the moment your light sweeps near it, but not before you catch a pinprick reflection off a scorched conduit knot: something thumb-sized tucked in there.

Your comm crackles as you say, “Helix—if you can hear me, stay off the line.” The tightbeam operator doesn’t answer with words—just a brief burst of layered harmonics and then a hard cut, as if they obeyed or got forced out.

From the corridor, now quiet, something drags once across metal—slow—then stops. Not retreating. Waiting.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re back inside SPINE-2 Recorder Service Bay, shoulder to the breaker block; the open pressure door is behind you, corridor beyond lit only by your spill.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Equalization: stabilized  
- Recorder bay power: hard-cut  
- Comms: Helix line silent

### Turn 52 [PLAYER]

I snap my light up to that doorframe conduit knot and rip the thumb-sized gizmo free with the cable-clip tool, then stomp it flat. Rifle back up, I hug the hinge-side and slice the corridor with my beam. “You’re out there—show yourself or I start shooting bulkheads until something screams.”

*Agent reasoning: Something’s planted by the doorframe and whatever’s in the corridor is waiting; I’m not letting it box me in. I’ll clear the device fast, then push into the corridor and take the fight to it.*

### Turn 53 [GAME]

You snap your light up into the doorframe conduit knot and hook the cable-clip tool behind the thumb-sized device. It fights you—held in by a smear of resin and a single filament lead—but you rip it free in one brutal pull.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the gizmo comes away with a faint *chirp* and a last blink of red. When you stomp it, it doesn’t shatter like a simple bug; it *pops* and smears, exhaling a sweet, solvent stink. A wafer-thin coil inside unspools and goes slack like a dead nerve.

For a heartbeat, the corridor’s amber strips—supposedly dead with the bay power cut—flare dimly anyway, as if something else is feeding them. In that flare you catch it:

A figure at the edge of your beam, down-corridor and low—too close to the deck, moving wrong. Not a suited intruder. More like a **bundle of cables and plating** dragging itself hand-over-hand, using the corridor seams as purchase. It freezes when your light hits, then *folds* into the shadow of a maintenance recess with practiced speed.

Your rifle comes up. You hug hinge-side, slicing the corridor with your beam.

“You’re out there—show yourself or I start shooting bulkheads until something screams.”

From the recess comes a reply that isn’t a voice and isn’t silence: a soft, layered **harmonic** that matches the recorder stack’s earlier vibration—only now it’s coming from the corridor walls themselves. The sound makes your teeth ache. Somewhere deeper in the ship, something heavy answers with a single, deliberate **thud**.

Behind the loosened conduit panel where the gizmo was nested, your light catches flaked safety paint and a seam that’s been worried open recently. A corner of a **Helix evidence pouch** peeks out—“QUIET DESK” microstamp still readable under soot.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re inside the dark Recorder Service Bay, hinge-side of the open pressure door; corridor beyond is dim, intermittently self-lit.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Doorframe bug: destroyed  
- Corridor lighting: intermittent, external feed  
- Movement sighted: low, cable-like entity

### Turn 54 [PLAYER]

I yank the Helix “Quiet Desk” evidence pouch out of the conduit seam and stuff it into my kit without looking. Then I lean out and dump a tight 3-round burst into the maintenance recess where it folded, walking the shots low along the deck seams. “Last chance—crawl out slow or I come in and tear you apart.”

*Agent reasoning: That thing’s not talking and it’s too close; I’m not letting it set an ambush. I’ll grab the pouch fast, then flush the recess with gunfire and advance hard to finish it.*

### Turn 55 [GAME]

You yank the **Helix “Quiet Desk”** pouch out of the conduit seam by feel—adhesive tearing with a faint crackle—and jam it into your kit without looking. The pouch is heavier than it should be, like it’s packed with a dense cartridge and a folded strip of something rigid.

You lean out hinge-side and fire a tight 3-round burst into the maintenance recess.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the rounds strike low exactly where you walk them—deck seams, recess lip, the shadow line. Sparks whip out. The third shot punches into something that isn’t just bulkhead: you hear a wet, metallic *clack* and a strangled harmonic that flutters like a voice losing pitch. Something jerks back inside the recess, scraping hard enough to leave a bright gouge in the deck.

Then the recess answers.

A thin filament—almost invisible until it catches your muzzle light—**whips out** from the recess and snaps across the doorway like a tripline, aimed shin-height. Not thrown blindly: set with intent. It bites into the hinge-side frame and goes taut, vibrating with that same layered hum. If you step through fast, it’ll take your legs or your balance.

In the corridor beyond, the intermittent amber strips flare again—*not from your bay*. In that flare you catch a second detail: fresh drag marks leading away from the recess toward the spine access trunk, as if whatever you hit is **still mobile** and pulling itself deeper.

Over comm—despite your warning—Helix’s tightbeam operator comes back as a whisper under static, strained and fast: “Kade—Quiet Desk pouches don’t travel alone. If it’s tagged, it’s—” The rest is swallowed by a rising harmonic squeal, like the line is being played.

Your threat hangs in the air. The only “reply” is the filament’s vibration and a slow, deliberate thud deeper in the ship, closer than before.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re still in the dark **SPINE-2 Recorder Service Bay**, half-covered behind the hinge-side of the open pressure door; the corridor is a narrow kill-lane, now strung with a taut filament at shin height.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Quiet Desk pouch: secured  
- Recess target: hit, withdrew  
- Doorway: trip-filament set

### Turn 56 [PLAYER]

I hook the cable-clip tool under the filament and saw it through, then toss a loose panel scrap into the corridor to see if anything else trips. Rifle up, I step over the cut line and advance toward the spine access trunk, hugging the wall. “Helix—what do you mean ‘tagged’? Spit it out fast or stay off.”

*Agent reasoning: That filament is a trap meant to drop me. I’m not giving it that—cut it, then push forward hard before it resets or brings friends.*

### Turn 57 [GAME]

You hook the cable-clip tool under the taut filament and saw.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** it doesn’t cut like wire. It *sings* under tension—high, thin—and the tool’s jaws skate like they’re on glass. You bear down, teeth-grinding, and it finally parts with a sharp *snap* that stings your knuckles through the glove. The severed ends recoil into the frame and recess, whipping like live things and then going still.

You scoop a loose panel scrap and toss it into the corridor.

It clatters twice, slides, then stops dead as if it hit tacky resin. A half-second later the scrap *tilts*—not from gravity—like something beneath the deck seam nudged it to listen. The corridor’s amber strips flicker in sympathy, a pulse that doesn’t match any emergency rhythm.

Rifle up, you step over the cut line and advance, hugging the wall toward the spine access trunk. Your boots stick slightly at the seam where the scrap stopped; the deck feels warmer there, like a concealed conduit is overworking.

“Helix—what do you mean ‘tagged’? Spit it out fast or stay off.”

The tightbeam operator comes back clipped and breathy, fighting interference: “Tagged means Quiet Desk pouches carry a locator—short-range inductive. Not GPS. It wakes up when it hears Helix hardware… like your tap puck. If you’ve got it on you, you’re a beacon to anything listening on our maintenance band.”

A second voice ghosts under theirs—same channel, wrong cadence—repeating the operator’s words a beat late, then adding something in a layered harmonic that makes your molars ache. The operator swallows hard: “That isn’t me. Kade—kill your Helix gear. Now.”

Ahead, near the spine access trunk, you catch movement: not the cable-bundle shape this time, but a **fresh smear of wet handprint** sliding down the wall as if someone just braced there—then nothing, only the slow tick of contracting hull.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re in the main corridor outside SPINE-2, moving starboard-side wall toward the spine access trunk; behind you, the recorder bay doorframe is a dark rectangle with frayed filament ends tucked into it.

**STATUS UPDATES**

### Turn 58 [PLAYER]

I kill my Helix comm and tap puck—hard power down, batteries out if I can—then shove the Quiet Desk pouch into a loose wall cavity and kick the panel back over it. Rifle up, I advance fast to the spine access trunk and fire a single round into the deck seam where the panel scrap stuck, then bark into the darkness, “I’m coming through—move or die.”

*Agent reasoning: If the pouch is a beacon and the comm is compromised, I need to go radio-silent and stop broadcasting. Then I push hard toward the spine trunk and force contact before it sets more traps.*

### Turn 59 [GAME]

You hard-kill your Helix comm first—thumb the latch, rip the power cell, and the carrier hiss dies instantly. The tap puck comes next; you pop its backplate with the pry bar edge and thumb the battery out. The corridor’s intermittent amber flicker **stutters**, then drops to a weaker, less frequent pulse.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the harmonic pressure in your teeth eases a notch, like something just lost a clean tone to follow.

You jam the Quiet Desk pouch into a loose wall cavity—old conduit chase with a half-sprung panel—and kick the panel back into place. It doesn’t sit flush; there’s a thin crescent gap that would be obvious in a slow search, but it’s covered from casual sightlines.

Rifle up, you move fast toward the spine access trunk. As you pass the spot where the panel scrap stuck, you fire a single round into the deck seam.

The shot punches in—and the deck answers. Not an explosion, not a ricochet: a **sharp recoil through the floor** like you struck a tensioned cable. The seam weeps a clear, viscous bead that beads up like coolant… then crawls *against* gravity a few centimeters before freezing. The panel scrap twitches once, dragged a finger-width toward the seam.

From ahead, near the spine trunk hatch, something shifts in the dark—low and quick. You catch a glimpse of reflective braid or wet cabling slipping behind the trunk’s ladderwell lip.

In the dead air where your comm used to be, a voice still arrives—faint, not over radio, more like vibration carried through the hull: “...tagged…” it echoes, trying the word like it’s learning your language.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re in the main corridor, starboard wall at your shoulder, within a few meters of the **spine access trunk**; behind you, the recorder bay door is a dark cutout and the stashed panel sits slightly proud.

The hull tick deepens—closer, heavier—like something repositioning below deck. The corridor lights keep pulsing, but now they feel less like “power” and more like **a heartbeat you’re not synced to**.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Helix comm/tap puck: powered down
- Quiet Desk pouch: stashed in wall cavity
- Deck seam: reactive, leaking viscous fluid
- Contact: movement at spine trunk lip

### Turn 60 [PLAYER]

I snap my beam up into the spine access trunk and light the ladderwell hard, then fire two quick rounds into the lip where the cabling slipped. “Nowhere left—come out!” I advance to the hatch, boot the edge for movement, and start dropping in, rifle leading.

*Agent reasoning: Something’s in the spine trunk lip and the deck seam is alive—if I hesitate it’ll set another trap. I’ll flush it out with light and lead, then push into the trunk aggressively.*

### Turn 61 [GAME]

You snap your beam up into the **spine access trunk** and flood the ladderwell with hard white light. Dust motes hang like glittering ash in the shaft; the rungs descend into a darker throat where the light starts to die.

You fire two quick rounds into the lip where the wet cabling slipped.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the first round chips the ladderwell frame; the second hits something soft-hidden-hard. There’s a **wet slap** and then a brittle *tink* like a ceramic bead shattering. A length of braided, slick “cable” whips back out of sight—fast, coordinated—leaving behind a smear that **steams** faintly where it touches exposed metal.

“Nowhere left—come out!”

Your voice bounces down the shaft and comes back wrong—half a beat late, slightly harmonized, as if the trunk itself is answering.

You advance, boot the edge for movement. The hatch frame shudders—not from your kick, but from below, like something just **braced** against the underside. The ladder rungs vibrate under your glove when you commit your weight.

You start dropping in, rifle leading.

Halfway down the first body-length, the light catches a detail: **fresh handprints**—too wet—on the inside wall of the trunk, spaced like someone climbed *up* in a hurry. Below them, a thin filament lattice—nearly invisible—has been strung across the shaft two meters down, not tight like a tripline but loose like a **net** meant to snag rifle barrels and limbs.

At the same time, from somewhere deeper in the ship, a heavy impact thuds—one… then a second—closing distance toward the trunk base, like something repositioning to meet you.

No comm chatter now. But you still hear the earlier Helix operator’s voice—distant, not transmitted, carried through hull resonance: “Kill your Helix gear… now…” It repeats as if the ship is rehearsing it.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re in the spine access trunk, descending the ladder; the corridor you came from is above and behind, a thin rectangle of amber pulse.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Ladderwell lip: target hit, withdrew  
- Shaft hazard: filament net below  
- Heavy movement: converging from deeper decks

### Turn 62 [PLAYER]

I clamp my boots on the rungs and lean back, keeping my rifle tight to my chest, then saw at the filament net with the cable-clip tool until it gives. As soon as it slackens, I rip free a chunk of it and fling it down the shaft, then fire a single probing shot into the darkness below and growl, “Try again and I’ll feed you your own wiring.”

*Agent reasoning: That net is meant to bind my rifle and limbs—if I push through I’m dead. I’ll cut it fast, then drop a surprise down the shaft before whatever’s coming reaches the base.*

### Turn 63 [GAME]

You clamp your boots to the rungs and lean back, rifle hugged tight, then hook the cable-clip tool into the filament lattice and start sawing.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** it *cuts*, but not cleanly—each strand gives with a high, glassy whine that travels into your wrists. The net slackens in ugly increments, trying to curl back toward your hands like static cling with intent. You keep your forearms locked and finish the last few strands; the lattice sags away from the shaft’s centerline.

You rip a fist-sized chunk free. It’s lighter than it should be—more like dried tendon than wire—and it leaves a faint sweet-ozone smear on your glove. You fling it down the shaft.

It doesn’t fall straight. Halfway down, it **arcs** and sticks to the trunk wall as if the air itself guided it. A beat later, something below tugs it hard—*snap*—and it vanishes into the dark.

You fire a single probing shot into the black beneath.

The muzzle flash strobes the shaft: for a fraction of a second you see **a knot of braided wet cabling** wrapped around the ladder cage down below, not hanging—*braced*—and a pale, hand-shaped imprint blooming on the metal like condensation. Your round hits with a dull thud and the braced knot **recoils**, retreating deeper with a skittering scrape that’s too fast for something heavy.

Your growl comes out steady, but the trunk answers anyway—your own words return a half-beat late, harmonized: “...feed you… wiring…”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re midway down the spine access ladderwell; above you, the corridor is a thin amber slit, below you the shaft widens into darkness that smells like hot insulation and coolant.

Down-deck, those heavy impacts you heard earlier shift position—now offset to port, like something circling the base rather than charging straight in. And somewhere very close, behind the trunk wall, something taps—three light ticks—testing the metal near your stashed wall panel location as if it still remembers where the “beacon” was.

### Turn 64 [PLAYER]

I yank a chemflare, crack it, and drop it down the shaft to paint the bottom. Then I descend fast, keeping my back to the cage, rifle down and ready—if anything moves on the ladder I unload center-mass. “You want the pouch? Come take it—down here.”

*Agent reasoning: Something’s circling the base and another is sniffing where I hid the pouch—if I keep climbing blind I get pinned. I’m going to make noise and light at the bottom, then drop fast and take the base before they set another trap.*

### Turn 65 [GAME]

You yank a chemflare—except your fingers hit empty webbing. No flare. Whatever kit you came aboard with, it’s down to steel and improvisation.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** you make your own “paint.” You thumb the rifle light to strobe-bright for a heartbeat and drop the only thing you can spare without losing leverage: a torn strip of the tacky filament fragment. It flutters, then **gets caught** in the shaft’s convection and sails down like a drifting jellyfish. When it reaches the base, it sticks to something and suddenly goes taut—like it’s been **hooked**.

You descend fast anyway, back to the cage, rifle down.

The last few rungs shiver under you. Not from your weight—something below just **hit** the ladder frame and let go. The shaft opens into the trunk base: a cramped junction with a low service crawl to starboard and a wider cross-passage ahead. Your light catches the floor: smeared coolant sheen, boot prints going *in* and none coming out, and a scatter of bright ceramic chips—one of your earlier hits paid off.

“You want the pouch? Come take it—down here.”

Your words don’t just echo. They come back threaded with another voice—thin, careful, like the ship is ventriloquizing: “Pouch… where?” It isn’t taunting. It sounds *curious*.

From the starboard crawl, that braided wet cabling slides into view—no body, no face, just a coordinated bundle testing the threshold like a hand feeling for a tripwire. It pauses at your light, then retracts, leaving behind a single fresh handprint on the bulkhead that blooms and fades like condensation.

Over the hull’s bone-conducted resonance, the Helix tightbeam operator cuts in—faint, distorted, but real enough to raise neck hair: “Kade, if you’re in SPINE access—do not go deeper. Audit team’s tightbeam is dead. Something’s spoofing return-path. If you can hear me, mark your position with—” The sentence fractures into static and a soft, almost musical tone.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re at the **base of the spine access trunk**, ladder behind you, cross-passage ahead, starboard crawl tight and low; the air tastes like hot insulation and sweet coolant.

**STATUS UPDATES**

### Turn 66 [PLAYER]

I back up until my shoulder’s almost on the ladder cage, rifle trained on that starboard crawl. I key my throat mic out of habit, then just shout, “Pouch is up-corridor in the wall—come out and I’ll show you,” and I rake the crawl entrance with a short burst the second anything moves.

*Agent reasoning: I’m not letting some cable-thing herd me. I’ll bait it into the open, keep my exit clear, and use the ladder as a choke point if it rushes.*

### Turn 67 [GAME]

You back up until your shoulder nearly kisses the ladder cage, rifle welded to the starboard crawl’s mouth. Your thumb hits the throat mic out of muscle memory—nothing but a dead, dry click in your ear; the ship’s interference eats the band. So you shout it raw.

“Pouch is up-corridor in the wall—come out and I’ll show you.”

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the crawl answers with motion—fast. The braided wet cabling surges to the threshold like it’s committing, and you immediately rake the entrance with a short burst.

Muzzle flash turns the crawl into a stuttering slideshow: slick strands, a glimpse of something pale and jointed deeper back, then impacts. Rounds chew the lip and punch into the crawl. You hit something that isn’t just cable—there’s a **thick, tar-dark spray** that spatters outward and beads on the deck like oily mercury. The bundle snaps back hard, retreating with a scraping, furious skitter.

But your burst has a cost: the crawl’s rim is lined with conduit and old service runs. One round clips a pressurized line—coolant or fire suppressant—and the junction **hisses**, fogging the base of the trunk with a cold chemical mist that bites your nose and makes your eyes water. Visibility drops to a few meters in the low space.

In the fog, the ship gives you that half-beat-late harmony again—only now it uses your exact cadence: “...come out… I’ll show you…” like it’s practicing how to wear your voice.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** base of the spine access trunk; ladder cage at your back, cross-passage ahead blurred by a spreading chemical fog, starboard crawl a dark mouth spitting mist.

The Helix tightbeam operator cuts back in, more urgent, syllables punched through static: “Kade—don’t—” then a soft tone rides over him and he’s gone. Immediately after, a faint *clink… clink* comes from the cross-passage ahead—ceramic chips shifting under a careful step that isn’t yours.

The tar-dark droplets on the deck begin to **crawl** toward the crawl entrance in tiny, purposeful pulls, as if the spill is trying to collect itself.

**STATUS UPDATES**

### Turn 68 [PLAYER]

I pivot off the crawl and snap my rifle toward the cross-passage, firing a tight two-round burst at the source of the *clink clink*, then backpedal onto the first rungs of the ladder to get height over the fog. “Show yourself—now!”

*Agent reasoning: I’ve got movement ahead and a wounded thing in the crawl; the fog’s killing my sight, so I need to control angles and flush them out before I get boxed in.*

### Turn 69 [GAME]

You pivot off the starboard crawl and snap the rifle into the cross-passage haze. Two tight shots—controlled, centerline.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the rounds hit *something* solid. The first impact throws a bright spark and a sharp metallic *pang* that isn’t bulkhead; the second lands with a wetter, duller note. A shape stumbles in the fog—human-sized, low to the ground—then collapses out of sight with a scrape that drags ceramic chips across deck plating.

You backpedal onto the first rungs of the ladder, boots finding purchase. Up here, your light cuts over the top of the chemical mist; you’ve bought yourself a slice of visibility.

“Show yourself—now!”

A voice answers from the fog, strained and ragged, very close to where you fired: “Don’t—don’t shoot—” It coughs hard, then forces words through it. “Helix… audit… I’m not—” Another cough. “They’re gone. Recorder bay—sealed—”

As the fog eddies, your beam catches a **Helix audit jacket** half-submerged in mist and a gloved hand pawing weakly at the deck. The glove is tagged with a microstamp strip—corporate issue. There’s a dark smear spreading under the torso, slow in low-g.

At the same time, the *other* problem keeps moving: the tar-dark droplets you spilled earlier are still creeping, collecting toward the starboard crawl like they’re being reeled in. And behind your ladder—up-shaft—something makes a soft, patient contact on the cage: *tick… tick… tick*, matching the earlier three-test pattern, now closer, like it’s learned where you like to stand.

The Helix tightbeam operator punches through again, barely coherent: “Kade—ID confirm—who’s—” The channel warps, and for half a second his voice is overlaid by your own cadence, as if the ship is trying on both of you at once.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re two rungs up at the base of the spine trunk ladder, looking down over a spreading chemical fog into the cross-passage; starboard crawl mouth is to your right, ladder shaft rises behind you into amber-lit darkness.

### Turn 70 [PLAYER]

I climb up another few rungs and whip my light up-shaft. “Whatever’s up there—move and I’ll cut you in half.”  

Without taking my muzzle off the ladder, I bark down at the Helix jacket, “Hands where I can see them. Who are you—name and badge—now.” Then I snap a quick glance to the starboard crawl and put one warning round into the deck right at its lip.

*Agent reasoning: I’ve got a wounded Helix suit in the fog, something stalking the ladder above me, and that crawl thing regrouping—no time to chat. I need height, control the ladder, and keep the audit guy alive enough to talk.*

### Turn 71 [GAME]

You climb three more rungs, boots ringing the ladder cage, and whip your light up the shaft.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the beam catches a silhouette hugging the cage above—too close to be debris. For a fraction of a second you see **fingers** threaded through the mesh like someone’s been hanging there, head tucked to avoid the light. When you snarl your warning, it doesn’t charge; it **recoils** up and away with a spider-quick scramble, vanishing into the amber-lit throat. The *tick…tick…tick* becomes a rapid rattle for two seconds, then stops dead—as if it learned to hold still.

You keep the muzzle up, then bark down without giving it your back.

“Hands where I can see them. Who are you—name and badge—now.”

In the fog below, the Helix-jacketed figure drags an arm into your light and spreads their fingers wide on the deck, palm up—compliance, barely. Their voice is shredded and wet. “Juno… Juno Marr. Helix Meridian Audit, SPINE-2 detail.” A cough that tastes like blood. “Badge… in my inner… left. Don’t—don’t come down. It’s in the lines. It listens.”

Your quick glance to starboard catches the crawl mouth glistening—those tar droplets have mostly gathered there now, pooled like a living spill right at the lip.

You put a warning round into the deck at the crawl’s edge.

The shot cracks and throws sparks; the pooled tar **flinches**—not away, but *together*, dimpling as if something underneath just sucked in a breath. A thin strand of wet cabling peeks out, tests the new crater in the deck, then slips back with a soft, disappointed scrape.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re several rungs up in the spine trunk ladder cage; fog blankets the junction below, cross-passage ahead barely visible; the starboard crawl is a dark slit at floor level.

Above you, nothing moves—yet the air shifts like someone just held their breath.

Below, Juno Marr’s hand stays splayed, but their other arm twitches toward their jacket as if to prove the badge—then stops, afraid you’ll interpret it wrong. “Recorder bay door… it shut itself,” they rasp. “We heard… singing in the return-path. Then the team—” Another cough, a choke. “They walked. Like sleep.”

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Ladder shaft: contact retreated upward
- Helix auditor: ID given (Juno Marr)
- Starboard crawl: pooled “tar” reacting to shots
- Fog: still limiting visibility

### Turn 72 [PLAYER]

“Juno Marr—don’t reach. Use two fingers and *slide* the badge out, then toss it into my light. Slow.”  

I keep my rifle angled up-shaft and call out, “And you—up there—keep crawling and I’ll ventilate the ladder.”  

Then, without moving from the rungs, I bark down at Juno, “Where’s Recorder Bay from this junction—left or straight? Give me a direction and a door code if you’ve got one.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m pinned between something above and something in the crawl; I need leverage and intel fast. I’ll control the auditor at gunpoint, get the badge tossed up, and use her to point me to the recorder bay while I keep eyes up-shaft.*

### Turn 74 [PLAYER]

“Juno Marr—don’t reach. Two fingers, slide the badge out, then toss it into my light. Slow.”

I keep my rifle angled up-shaft. “You up there—move again and I ventilate this ladder.”

Without shifting off the rungs, I bark down, “Recorder Bay from this junction—left or straight? Any door code you’ve got, spit it out.”

*Agent reasoning: No new info came in, so I’ll restate control: keep the high ground, force Juno to ID safely, and demand directions while warning whatever’s above I’m ready to shoot.*

### Turn 75 [GAME]

Juno’s breathing hitches at your tone. In the fog below, her left hand stays splayed flat while her right hand—two fingers only, trembling—hooks the inside of her jacket without lifting the fabric.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** she manages it. A thin **Helix badge strip** slides free, catches on something sticky with a faint *tch*, then pops loose. She flicks it up into your light in a weak arc. It clatters off a ladder rung, spins, and you catch it against the cage with your forearm before it can fall back into the mist. The strip flashes **microstamped ID** and a rolling audit token—real enough to fool a quick scan, unless Helix has already burned it.

Up-shaft, nothing moves on your command—no rattle, no footfall—just a soft, dampened shift of air like someone pressing their face to the mesh out of sight.

Juno swallows and answers your direction question fast, like she’s afraid the ship will interrupt her. “Straight. Cross-passage goes straight into SPINE-2 service corridor—pressure door with the yellow stenciling. Recorder Bay is *past* it, second door on the right.” Another wet cough. “Code… won’t help. It’s on **audit token handshake** now. But—” she forces the words out, “maintenance override panel is **low-left of the frame**, under the gasket. Pop it. Two-pin bridge—older ships still have it.”

Your light glances toward the starboard crawl lip: the pooled tar has drawn back a few centimeters from your warning crater, but it hasn’t retreated—more like it’s **waiting**, gathered in a tighter, denser knot. A single filament-thin strand probes the edge and then goes still, as if listening to Juno’s voice.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re mid-ladder in the spine trunk cage; above is amber-lit shaft darkness, below is fog-choked junction with the cross-passage straight ahead and the starboard crawl at deck level.

Helix tightbeam crackles again, distorted: “—Marr? Confirm Marr—” then the channel smears, and the last syllable comes out in a second voice that isn’t his, perfectly calm: “Latch the choir.”

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Helix badge strip: acquired  
- Recorder Bay: straight, past SPINE-2 door  
- Override hint: panel low-left, two-pin bridge  
- Ladder contact: silent, still above

### Turn 76 [PLAYER]

I shove the badge strip into my chest rig and climb down two rungs, rifle still covering up-shaft. “Juno—if you can crawl, crawl to the base of the ladder and hug the cage. If you can’t, say it now.”

I drop the muzzle to the junction and sweep the fog with my light, then snap the rifle toward the starboard crawl. “You down there—stay in your hole.”  

Then I move off the ladder toward the cross-passage, keeping my back to the ladder cage, and call back up into the shaft, “Last warning—show yourself or I start shooting through the mesh.”

*Agent reasoning: I’ve got the direction and the badge strip; the ladder thing is a threat above and the tar is a threat beside. I’m not staying boxed in—secure Juno fast, then push straight to Recorder Bay before the ship “latches” anything.*

### Turn 77 [GAME]

You jam the badge strip into your chest rig and drop two rungs, rifle still pinned up-shaft.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Juno tries to obey. In your light she drags herself through the fog on elbows and knees, making it maybe a meter before her strength dumps out. She slaps a palm against the ladder cage and clings there, cheek pressed to the metal like it’s the only solid thing left. “Can’t… legs won’t,” she rasp-whispers. “Something… in the vents. It took the feeling.”

You sweep the junction. The fog parts in your beam in slow sheets—deck plates, the starboard crawl lip, the straight cross-passage beyond. When you snap the rifle toward the crawl and warn it, the pooled tar at the lip tightens into a glossy knot and goes perfectly still, like a creature freezing under a predator’s gaze.

You step off the ladder toward the cross-passage, keeping your back to the cage. The moment your boots leave the rungs, the ladder vibrates—*not* from your movement. A quick, skittering impact from above, then a wet scrape along the mesh.

You shout your last warning up-shaft.

Something answers—not with words. A pale shape presses against the ladder cage above your head-height: **a face-shaped bulge** in the fogged light, as if skin is being pushed through wire. Then fingers hook in, impossibly long, and it yanks itself laterally into a maintenance notch you hadn’t seen. No footsteps. No breathing. Just that damp *tch-tch* of contact and release.

Juno’s eyes track upward, wide and glassy. “Don’t… shoot it,” she says, and the way she says it isn’t pleading—it’s *instruction*. “It learns the sound.”

Down the straight cross-passage, the SPINE-2 service corridor’s pressure door sits half-lit by amber strips. A small status panel near it blinks an **incomplete handshake** icon—like it’s waiting for an audit token that’s no longer authorized. Under the fog’s chemical sweetness, you catch a fresher note: overheated insulation, recent.

Behind you, the starboard crawl makes a soft, patient *tap*—once—on the deck edge, like a knuckle.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re at the junction floor now, one step off the ladder cage; cross-passage straight ahead, starboard crawl at your right ankle line, fog pooling around your shins.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Juno Marr: immobile, at ladder base
- Up-shaft contact: slipped into side notch
- SPINE-2 door: handshake pending, panel active

### Turn 78 [PLAYER]

I swing my rifle up and keep the notch covered. “Juno—shut up and hold on.”

I grab the back of her jacket and drag her tight behind the ladder cage for cover, then shove my shoulder toward the SPINE-2 door and drop to a knee at the low-left frame, ripping at the gasket for the override panel. “If you’re up there, show your face again—I’m done being polite.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m not letting that thing sit above my head, and I’m not wasting time negotiating with a door. I’ll pin the notch, grab Juno so she’s not bait, and force the corridor door with the override panel.*

### Turn 79 [GAME]

You keep the notch hard-covered and snarl Juno quiet. She flinches but clamps her mouth shut, both hands white-knuckled on the ladder cage.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** you hook the back of her jacket and haul. She drags like dead weight across tacky deck plating, but you get her tight behind the ladder cage’s uprights—metal between her and the corridor sightlines. Her boots leave faint wet smears in the fog.

You shoulder toward the SPINE-2 pressure door and drop to a knee at the low-left frame. Your fingers dig under the gasket seam—rubber that’s gone soft and gummy. You rip. The gasket peels back with a long, reluctant *shrrk*, and a thin maintenance flap pops loose: a recessed **override bay** with an old two-pin service bridge socket, just like Juno said.

As your light hits the cavity, something up in the notch shifts—fast, controlled. Not a full body, just a hint of pale surface withdrawing from the edge of your beam.

Then the ship answers your movement: above the amber strip junction, the “dead” corridor **clicks**—a clean relay sound—and a shape unfolds from the underside of the warped cable tray.

A Helix **HAZ-AR/9 sentry turret**, paint-flaked and taped to look like conduit, rotates with a dry servo whine. Its barrel tracks down the longest sightline… and pauses, recalibrating, as your crouched position tucks you close to the wall and doorframe. A thin red lidar line combs the fog, stuttering as it hits the ladder cage and your light scatter.

Juno’s whisper leaks out despite herself, tiny and panicked: “Helix doesn’t leave those on derelicts. They— they *hunt* with them.”

From the starboard crawl, the tar knot gives a slow, satisfied ripple, as if the turret’s wake-up tone was a dinner bell.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re kneeling at the SPINE-2 door’s low-left frame, shoulder against cold metal; ladder cage and Juno are behind you in the junction fog; the starboard crawl lip sits at your right periphery.

The override bay is open in front of your hands—two pins waiting—while the turret’s servo keeps making micro-corrections overhead, trying to solve the fog and angles.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Juno: moved behind ladder cage
- SPINE-2 override bay: exposed
- Helix turret: active, tracking sightline

### Turn 80 [PLAYER]

I lean out just enough to get a line and dump a short burst into the turret’s housing/servo joint, then snap back behind the frame. “Juno—stay down!”  

Without waiting, I jam my knife into the override bay and bridge the two pins. “Door. Now.”

*Agent reasoning: A turret is a clear, immediate threat—talking won’t help. I’m already in cover at the doorframe, so I’ll kill the turret fast before it locks, then brute-force the override to get through the door and out of this kill zone.*

### Turn 81 [GAME]

You lean out just enough to steal an angle and hammer a short burst into the turret’s housing where the servo collar meets the mount.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the first rounds bite—sparks and a sharp *crack* as the collar shears. The turret jerks, tries to correct, then over-rotates and slams its own barrel into the cable tray with a grinding shriek. It spits a panicked half-burst into the bulkhead above the ladder cage, chewing metal and showering the fog with hot flecks. You snap back behind the doorframe as the turret’s feed stutters and dies into a thin, angry whine. It’s not cleanly destroyed—just crippled and stuck, twitching in place like a busted insect.

“Juno—stay down!” lands as another involuntary spasm from the turret rattles the tray. Juno obeys, face to deck, both arms locked around the cage upright. “That was… marine,” she breathes, and there’s something like recognition in it. “Helix tags those turrets to **tightbeam proximity**. If it woke, someone’s listening.”

You don’t wait. You jam your knife into the override bay and bridge the two pins.

The panel **accepts** it—an old-school service bypass. The SPINE-2 pressure door shudders, seals vent a short cough of stale air, and the lock dogs begin to retract with a deep, reluctant clunk.

At the same instant, the starboard crawl answers: the tar knot at the lip **unfurls** a finger-thin filament that reaches toward the ladder base, tasting the air where Juno was dragged. It pauses at the edge of your light, then withdraws—slow, deliberate—like it’s learned the boundary you’ve drawn.

Over comms, the Helix tightbeam hisses back in, clearer now, riding the turret’s wake-up ping: “—contact confirmed. Kade on SPINE-2. Containment authorization—” The rest is swallowed by a second voice sliding under it, calm as a lullaby: “Latch the choir.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re crouched tight to the SPINE-2 door’s low-left frame, knife bridging the pins inches from your glove; behind you, Juno is prone at the ladder cage in shin-high fog; overhead, the crippled turret twitches and whines.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Turret: crippled, twitching

### Turn 82 [PLAYER]

I slap the knife out as soon as the dogs clear and shove the SPINE-2 door open, then backpedal to Juno and haul her by the collar toward the opening. “Move your arms or I’m carrying you.”

I key my comm and snarl, “Containment this,” then kill my transmitter and rip the tightbeam module off my rig if it’ll come free. Once Juno’s across the threshold, I swing my rifle back to the junction and fire a burst into the starboard crawl lip to keep that tar crap honest, then get the door shut behind us.

*Agent reasoning: Helix just tagged me and the door’s cycling; I need to get through now, drag Juno if possible, and kill comms so they can’t track or trigger more hardware.*

### Turn 84 [PLAYER]

I slap my knife free as soon as the dogs clear and slam the SPINE-2 door open, then backpedal to Juno and drag her by the collar toward the threshold. “Move your arms or I’m carrying you.”

I key the comm and snarl, “Containment this,” then kill my transmitter and rip the tightbeam module off my rig if it’ll come loose. Once Juno’s across, I swing back and dump a burst into the starboard crawl lip, then hit the door controls and get it sealed behind us.

*Agent reasoning: We need hard cover now—get Juno through SPINE-2, cut Helix tracking, and discourage that tar thing with gunfire before sealing the door.*

### Turn 85 [GAME]

You slap the knife free the instant the lock dogs clear and slam your shoulder into the SPINE-2 pressure door. It swings inward on a wheezing hinge, spilling colder air and a cleaner, drier stink—old electronics and desiccant packs—out of the Recorder Service corridor.

You backpedal to the ladder cage and drag Juno by the collar. She finally finds her spine, scrabbling with her forearms to help, boots skidding through the fog. “Don’t—don’t leave me in that hall,” she gasps, and you haul her across the threshold hard enough that she stumbles onto the SPINE-2 deck plating.

You key your comm just long enough to spit, “Containment this,” then kill your transmitter. The tightbeam module on your rig fights you—Helix loves tamper seals—but you rip it free with a sharp twist that tears the mounting clip and leaves a **hissing, hot connector** exposed. The moment it comes off, the background pressure in your ear vanishes; no more Helix voice riding your bones.

You pivot back into the junction and dump a burst into the starboard crawl lip. Rounds chew the edge and detonate something wet inside—tar-black filaments snap back, recoiling like burned hair in water. The crawl goes still, but not empty; you feel it withdrawing, patient.

Overhead, the crippled turret twitches once, tries to slew toward the muzzle flash, and grinds itself into a useless shudder.

You slap the SPINE-2 door control. The pressure door slams shut with a heavy, sealing *WHUMPF*, dogs cycling back into place. The last thing you see through the narrowing gap is the fog pulsing amber…and a faint, pale smear at the edge of the starboard crawl, like something pressed close to listen.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re now inside the SPINE-2 Recorder Service corridor, door sealed behind you; the air is colder and dry enough to sting your throat.

Juno is on hands and knees, shaking. She looks at the ripped-off module in your fist and whispers, “They’ll mark you dark. No welfare pings, no contract beacons—Helix will call it ‘lost in transit.’” Then, quieter: “But it also means the Choir can’t ride their line through you.”

Behind the sealed door, something taps once—too gentle to be settling metal.

### Turn 86 [PLAYER]

I shove the tightbeam module into a pouch and slap a strip of tape over the hissing connector. “Juno—on your feet. Quick: what the hell is the Choir, and what’s past SPINE-2 that gets us out?”  

I put my ear and palm to the sealed door, rifle up, then scan the corridor for an emergency lock bar or manual wheel to dog it shut harder. “If that tapping turns into cutting, I’m blowing the hinge side.”

*Agent reasoning: We bought seconds. I want hard cover, a way forward, and I don’t trust Juno’s “Choir” talk—need intel fast while I prep to move and keep that door from being a liability.*

### Turn 87 [GAME]

You jam the tightbeam module into a pouch and slap tape over the exposed connector. The hiss dulls to a faint, intermittent sizzle—still hot, but no longer venting freely. The smell of scorched adhesive blooms for a second in the dry SPINE-2 air.

Juno forces herself upright, one hand on the wall, eyes too wide. “The Vesper Choir? Dockside grief-peddlers. Relief suits, clean-air canisters, ‘counseling.’” She swallows. “But they’re not Helix and they’re not Freejack. They… *listen* to wrecks. They show up where there’s a signal. They call it ‘the singing.’ If they get a hook in you, they keep you talking, keep you *here*, until whatever’s sealed wakes up.”

You press ear and palm to the sealed door. Through the metal you feel the tap again—gentle, testing—followed by a faint, slow drag like a fingertip across paint. Not cutting. Not yet. Your palm comes away with a thin smear of something tacky that shouldn’t be on this side of the seal.

You scan the corridor: SPINE-2 is a service run, narrower than the main hall, with conduit racks and a recessed emergency cabinet. Inside the cabinet is a **manual dogging bar**—a telescoping lever with a socket head meant to crank the door’s dog bolts if power fails. The door itself has a small access port with a hex interface.

Juno points past you with a shaking finger. “Out? This corridor runs to the Recorder Service Bay—core recorder cradle, audit ports. There’s also a **maintenance trunk** off the bay that drops toward port-side utility. It’s not ‘out’ out, but it’s away from the junction. If Helix containment teams board, they’ll come spine-first. If the Choir is here… they’ll come quiet.”

Behind the sealed door, the tapping stops. Silence stretches—then a soft *tick-tick* from above your head, in the conduit tray, like something settling where it shouldn’t.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re in the SPINE-2 Recorder Service corridor, sealed door behind you to aft; forward the corridor bends toward the Recorder Service Bay under cold white service strips.

### Turn 88 [PLAYER]

I yank the manual dogging bar out, jam it into the hex port, and crank the door dogs down as hard as they’ll go. Then I swing my rifle up at the conduit tray and bark at Juno, “Move—Recorder Bay, now. And keep your eyes up; if anything drops, I’m shooting first.”

*Agent reasoning: Something’s in the overhead tray and the door might not hold; I want the door dogged hard and I want to get moving toward the bay before we get boxed in.*

### Turn 89 [GAME]

The dogging bar seats with a satisfying *clunk* in the hex port. You crank—hard. The mechanism fights, then yields in jerky increments as the bolts drive deeper into their receivers. On the third full heave, the door gives a low, stressed groan and the seal tone shifts: tighter, more absolute. Whatever was testing from the other side answers with a muted *thud*—like it leaned in and met a wall it didn’t expect.

You keep the rifle up on the conduit tray.

Above, the tray ticks again—closer to a deliberate *step* than thermal settling. Dust sifts down in a thin stream. A cable bundle twitches, then stills, as if something flattened itself against the metal to avoid breaking silhouette.

Juno flinches at your barked order and moves, fast-limping toward the Recorder Service Bay. “Eyes up, got it—” She swallows and talks as she goes, words coming out like she’s forcing them through pain. “Recorder Bay has audit ports—Helix can pull a clean copy if they want to lie. The *raw* buffer is in the cradle housing. If it’s been touched, you’ll see tool marks. If it’s been—” she cuts herself off as another sound answers.

From behind the sealed SPINE-2 door: a soft, rhythmic pressure—*press…pause…press*—not cutting, not tapping. Like someone trying to learn the door’s heartbeat.

The corridor ahead is colder, service strips steady-white instead of amber. To your left, a narrow recessed panel is half-open, and inside you catch a glimpse of coiled fiber line and a small canister stamped with Helix orange—emergency sealant foam.

As you advance, your boot sole sticks for half a second to a spot that looks dry. When it lifts, a thin filament stretches and snaps back into the floor seam.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re moving forward along the SPINE-2 Recorder Service corridor; the sealed pressure door is behind you aft, the Recorder Bay access ahead under harsh white strips.

### Turn 90 [PLAYER]

I yank the Helix sealant foam canister and blast a hard line across the floor seam where that filament snapped back, then spray a quick choke patch up into the conduit tray gap above us. “Juno—don’t stop. Recorder Bay door, get it open.”

I backpedal a step with the rifle up, tracking the tray. “Show yourself or I start punching holes through the whole run.”

*Agent reasoning: Something’s in the conduit and the floor’s webbed; I need to deny it routes and keep Juno moving. Sealant foam can lock down seams and slow whatever’s tracking us.*

### Turn 91 [GAME]

The sealant canister kicks in your hand with a sharp chemical chuff. Expanding foam spits a bright, wet line across the floor seam—then swells, hardening fast into a ridged, glossy barricade. The tacky filament that snapped back tries to pull away and instead gets *caught*, embedded in the curing foam like a trapped tendon.

You snap the nozzle up and blast a choke patch into the conduit tray gap. Foam mushrooms into the slot and immediately meets resistance—something inside shifts, compressing against it. For half a breath the tray bulges, metal flexing with a muted *gong*, then whatever’s in there retreats deeper along the run. The foam holds, sealing the gap like a crude plug.

Your threat hangs in the cold air. Nothing “shows itself.” But you hear it now: a faint, fast scuttle further down the tray, moving away from your position toward the Recorder Bay bend.

Juno doesn’t stop. She reaches the Recorder Service Bay door—an inset hatch with a small audit keypad and a manual wheel. “It’s not powered,” she spits, and plants both hands on the wheel. Her shoulder shakes as she forces it; the wheel gives a quarter turn with a grinding squeal. “Kade—if that thing is in the tray, don’t shoot the conduit bundle—SPINE-2 feeds the recorder cradle. You punch it, we lose lights and maybe the bay seal.”

Behind you (aft, through the dogged door), that rhythmic *press…pause…press* changes. A single heavier *thump* answers the new resistance, as if it’s testing whether the door dogs are still seated.

In the corridor light, the foam line on the deck continues to expand a millimeter, creeping into micro-gaps—good sealant, expensive. And right beside it, a second hair-thin strand tries to slide under the ridge, fails, and quivers like it’s “breathing.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re mid-corridor between the sealed SPINE-2 pressure door (aft) and the Recorder Service Bay hatch (forward), under harsh white strips; chemical foam stings your nose.

**STATUS UPDATES**

### Turn 92 [PLAYER]

I stomp down hard on the “breathing” strand by the foam ridge to pin it, then shoulder in behind Juno and wrench the manual wheel with her. “Open, open—now!”

As soon as it cracks, I shove her through first, then blast a fat plug of sealant into the conduit tray seam near the bay bend and kick the hatch closed behind us. “If it comes through, I’m cutting it in half—power bundle or not.”

*Agent reasoning: The thing’s moving toward the Recorder Bay through the tray; I need that hatch open now and I want to slow or flush it without wrecking power. I’ll physically help Juno and use foam to block the tray near the bend, then get inside and seal up.*

### Turn 93 [GAME]

Your boot comes down on the “breathing” strand and it goes taut like live wire under your sole—then *gives* with a wet, elastic snap. Something yanks back from beneath the seam, dragging a smear of clear mucus across the foam ridge. The trapped filament doesn’t come free; it leaves a thin strip of itself behind, like it shed skin to escape.

You’re on Juno a heartbeat later. Shoulder to shoulder, you wrench the manual wheel. The hatch protests—metal-on-metal, dry and angry—then the dogs finally walk free with a clattering pop. A cold gust spills out of the Recorder Service Bay, carrying the coppery stink of overheated circuitry and old smoke.

“Go!” you snarl, and shove Juno through first. She stumbles inside, catches herself on a rack, and immediately starts scanning the bay like she’s looking for a specific panel. “Cradle’s on the far bulkhead—Helix put their audit tap right over it,” she says, voice tight. “If it’s been scrubbed, it’ll be *too* clean.”

You pivot back to the corridor bend and blast a fat plug of sealant into the conduit tray seam. The foam surges in—then the seam *pushes back* from the inside. The tray rattles as something slams against the fresh foam, testing it. The plug holds, but you hear movement diverting—scraping along the metal run, searching for another exit.

You kick the hatch closed. It catches, but not fully dogged—more “shut” than “sealed.” From the corridor side, a soft impact answers your closure, followed by a careful, patient drag along the hatch edge, like it’s mapping the gap.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** Inside the SPINE-2 Recorder Service Bay now—tight room, white service strips, recorder cradle housing on the far wall; the hatch back to the corridor is behind you, vibrating faintly with contact.

Juno wipes sweat off her upper lip with a shaking hand. “Kade… if we hard-seal in here and it vents SPINE-2, we’re in a box.” She nods at the cradle. “But if we don’t pull the raw buffer fast, Helix can still claim ‘corruption’ and bury it.”

In the bay’s corner, a Helix audit console sits dark—but its tightbeam coupler port is *freshly scored*, like someone recently ripped hardware out of it.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Strand: snapped free, residue left
- Conduit seam: foamed, holding (for now)
- Recorder Bay hatch: shut, not fully dogged

### Turn 94 [PLAYER]

I jam the hatch wheel and dog it down anyway—hard—then plant myself between the door and Juno with the rifle up. “Pull the raw buffer. Now. I’ll keep the hallway thing busy.”

I nod at the scored audit console port. “Someone already stole hardware—was that you, or are we not alone?”

*Agent reasoning: We need the raw buffer before Helix can spin the story, but that hatch is a weak point and something’s already probing it. I’ll force a quick grab while I physically secure the door and keep a firing line.*

### Turn 95 [GAME]

You slam the wheel and dog the hatch down until your shoulder screams. The mechanism bites, then seats—full engagement. The faint vibration at the seam stops for a half-second… then resumes as a dull, frustrated *thud* from the corridor side, now muffled by the tightened seal. Whatever’s out there can’t “feel” the gap anymore; it starts testing the metal instead.

**Sensory grounding:** Recorder Service Bay—close, cold, and overlit. The dogged hatch is behind you; the recorder cradle housing is across the bay, half-buried in cable looms and a Helix audit shroud.

Juno swallows, nods once, and moves with grim purpose. She drops to the cradle housing, pops a service skirt with her fingers, then uses your cable clip tool like she’s done it a hundred times. “Raw buffer is a cartridge stack—if the cradle’s intact.” Her voice tightens. “If it’s *not* intact… then Helix got here first, and this contract was a cleanup, not a retrieval.”

At your question about the scored port, she snaps her head up, eyes wide. “Not me. I didn’t even know you had a tightbeam module until you showed it. That scoring is from a rip—panic rip. Someone yanked a coupler out fast and dirty.” She glances at the hatch like it might answer. “Helix operator? Freejack? Choir? Doesn’t matter—means we’re late.”

As she pries deeper, the bay’s dark audit console flickers—one brief phantom blink of standby—then dies again, like it caught a heartbeat from somewhere else in the ship. In the same moment, the hull ticks shift cadence: *tick…tick…tick—pause—tick*, syncing uncomfortably with the impacts on the hatch.

Juno sucks in a breath. “Kade—cradle’s been opened before. Tool marks. Recent.” She slides a black, palm-sized cartridge free—warm, like it’s been running. “Got it. But if we don’t get it into a reader soon, it’ll handshake-lock to the last audit ID.”

### Turn 96 [PLAYER]

“Then we read it *now*. Where’s the nearest reader—inside this bay or in that maintenance trunk you mentioned?”  

I snatch the cartridge from her and shove it into my chest pouch, rifle still covering the hatch. “If this door starts to bow, we’re not negotiating with it—we’re moving.”  

I jerk my chin at the flickering audit console. “Can you hot it with whatever’s left in that console, or are we ripping the cradle’s reader out and running?”

*Agent reasoning: We’ve got the prize; I’m not waiting to get boxed in. We need a reader now, and I don’t trust that hatch to hold forever—so I’m pushing for the maintenance trunk and threatening anything in our way.*

### Turn 97 [GAME]

The cartridge thumps into your chest pouch, heat bleeding through the fabric like a live thing. Juno’s eyes track it, then flick to the hatch as another heavy *thud* lands—closer together now, testing rhythm instead of strength.

“Nearest reader is here,” she says, already moving. She yanks the cradle’s service skirt wider and exposes a recessed slot assembly—SPINE-2’s own buffer interface. “This bay *is* the reader, if the cradle board’s still got power. The maintenance trunk doesn’t have anything that can handshake a raw buffer without a Helix kit.”

**Sensory grounding:** You’re braced between the dogged hatch (aft, vibrating under impact) and the recorder cradle (forward bulkhead), rifle up; the bay smells of hot dust and scorched insulation.

Juno jabs a finger at the flickering audit console. “That console’s just an audit tap and uplink interface. It can *display* if it’s alive, but it won’t authenticate the cartridge by itself.” She grabs the Helix tightbeam module you ripped free earlier, turns it in her hands, and swears. “And someone already ripped the coupler out of this port—same scoring. They didn’t just steal hardware; they stole the *path*.”

She slams her palm against the console housing, then peels back a panel with a thumbnail. A tiny standby LED inside the console glows weakly—enough juice for a boot pulse, not enough for a clean read. “I can hot it—briefly—by backfeeding from the cradle’s service power. But if we do, anything listening on SPINE-2 will see a wake event. Helix loves wake events.”

Another impact hits the hatch—harder. The dogs hold, but the wheel shivers in its socket. From the seam you hear a thin, high scrape like metal being worried with something harder than fingernail.

Juno looks up at you, voice low and urgent. “If you want *now*, we slot the cartridge into the cradle interface and I pull only what we need—timestamps, audit ID, last-write signature. Full dump takes longer and makes more noise on the bus.”

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Raw buffer: secured on you  
- Hatch: holding, impacts escalating

### Turn 98 [PLAYER]

“Do it—minimal pull. Timestamps, audit ID, last-write. Nothing else.”

I yank the cartridge from my pouch and slam it into the cradle slot, then square up on the hatch with the rifle. “You’ve got ten seconds. If that wheel starts walking, we blow out the far panel and run.”

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is getting worked; we need fast intel before it breaks in. Minimal read gives us proof without lighting up the whole bus too long.*

### Turn 99 [GAME]

The cartridge seats with a brutal *clack* and the cradle answers like it’s been waiting: a low whine rises through the bulkhead, and thin status strips along the recorder housing stutter from dead to a sickly green.

Juno is already in it—one hand braced on the open service skirt, the other riding the exposed diagnostic pins with your cable clip tool like a makeshift probe. “Ten seconds,” she mutters, more to herself than you. The bay fills with the dry smell of warming dust and old insulation.

Behind you, the hatch takes a coordinated hit—*THOOM*—not just force, but placement. The wheel shivers a fraction of a turn against the dogs, then stops. The seam doesn’t gap, but the metal *sings* for a moment, a stressed harmonic that makes your teeth feel too tight in your skull.

Juno’s voice snaps sharp. “Got the minimal header—listen.”

She reads straight off the diagnostic blink codes, translating as she goes:

- “**Last-write timestamp:** 02:13:09 shiptime… that’s **hours**, not years.”
- “**Audit ID:** Helix Meridian internal—**QUIET DESK / Marr, J.**” She shoots you a look. “That’s your badge strip.”
- “**Last-write signature:** not a purge.” Her throat works. “It’s tagged **‘LATCH-CHOIR INIT’**… and the writer is flagged as **‘Containment Wellness’** authority.”

The cradle gives a second, deeper whine—like it’s trying to escalate into a full handshake. Juno slaps the service skirt hard. “That’s it. If it completes, it’ll beacon on the bus.”

Outside the hatch, the impacts stop. For one long, awful beat there’s only the hull’s ticking—then a slow drag across the dogged seam, as if something is listening for the cradle’s new electrical noise through the metal.

Juno yanks her hand back. “Kade—someone wrote to this recorder *recently*, under Helix ‘wellness’ authority. That’s not salvage protocol. That’s a leash.”

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Buffer header read: complete  
- Helix Audit ID: Marr, J.  
- Last-write tag: LATCH-CHOIR INIT

### Turn 100 [PLAYER]

I rip the cartridge back out and slam the cradle skirt shut, then put two rounds into the cradle’s power board to kill the whine. “They’re wearing my name—either spoof or setup. We’re done here.”

I grab Juno by the sleeve and drag her to the far panel. “Show me the fastest way out—now. If that hatch moves, I’m breaching this wall and we run blind.”

*Agent reasoning: That audit ID using my badge means I’m being framed or someone spoofed me; the cradle’s about to beacon and the thing outside is listening. I need to kill the handshake, grab the cartridge, and force an exit before we get boxed in.*

### Turn 101 [GAME]

The cartridge rips free with a wet-sounding suction pop, and when you slam the service skirt shut the cradle’s whine drops to a tense, wounded hum.

Your two rounds punch into the exposed power board through the half-seated panel—bright, vicious sparks and the stink of scorched polymer. The cradle dies hard: status strips flicker, then go black. For a heartbeat the whole bay feels quieter… until the ship answers with a distant *clunk* somewhere in the spine, like a relay dropping out.

**Sensory grounding:** You’re still in the SPINE-2 Recorder Service Bay; the dogged hatch is behind you, vibrating faintly, and the “far panel” is the bay’s forward maintenance bulkhead—thin composite over a cable chase.

Juno flinches at the shots, then lets you haul her. “Jesus—okay, okay.” She plants a boot, yanks her sleeve free enough to point. “Fastest out isn’t back through that hatch. There’s a **service chase** behind this panel that drops into the **SPINE trunk baffle**—starboard side. It’s tight, but it’s *movement*.”

As she talks, the dogged hatch stops vibrating and goes dead-still. Not “safe” still—*listening* still. Then, from the seam, a soft rasp starts again, slower than before, like something drawing a line to find the dogs by feel.

Juno presses her ear to the far panel, palm flat. “Hear that? Air moving. The chase still has differential—means it’s not fully flooded and it’s not welded shut.” Her voice drops. “But you just killed recorder power. If Helix was watching for a wake event, they’ll know it went dark. That buys seconds, not minutes.”

On the bay’s dark audit console, the weak standby LED you saw earlier finally gives up and dies—no more phantom blinks. At the same time, your comms pick up a thin burst of tightbeam static—too clean to be ship noise—then nothing, as if someone pinged and didn’t get the response they expected.

Juno grabs your dogging bar with both hands and shoves it into the panel’s seam. “You breach this, we go **down and starboard**. Watch for trip-lines—Helix sometimes strings fiber seals in chases.”

### Turn 102 [PLAYER]

I wrench the dogging bar hard and rip the panel free, then shove my rifle muzzle-first into the opening to check for lines and movement. “Juno, go—down and starboard. If you snag a fiber, stop and point, don’t yank.” I glance back at the hatch and bark, “If that seam opens, I’m dumping a mag through it and we run.”

*Agent reasoning: We’ve got seconds before the hatch gives or whatever’s outside gets clever. The chase is our exit; brute-force it fast, then keep Juno moving while I cover and watch for trip-lines.*

### Turn 103 [GAME]

The dogging bar bites, flexes, then the forward maintenance panel gives with a sharp *crack*—fasteners shearing rather than unscrewing. The sheet kicks inward and you rip it free in one ugly pull, exposing a black service chase that exhales a cold, stale breath across your knuckles.

You push the rifle muzzle-first into the opening. The weapon light throws a narrow cone down the chute: bundled conduits, ribbed ladder rungs, and—just like Juno warned—two hair-thin **fiber seals** stretched diagonally across the first meter, glinting like spider silk. No movement. No eyeshine. Just the faint shimmer of dust drifting the wrong way, toward the bay, as if something deeper is drawing air.

Juno swallows, then nods hard. “Copy. I see ’em.” She crouches, points with two fingers instead of touching, and threads herself in with painful care, shoulder scraping conduit jackets. “Down and starboard—there’s a baffle cross-passage about one deck. If it’s still open, we can ghost the ladderwell and come out behind the trunk—away from that door.”

Behind you, the dogged hatch answers your bark with action: the seam **ticks** and opens a hairline—millimeters—enough for a thread of darker air to leak through. Something presses on the other side, not slamming now, but *leaning*, testing the dogs’ bite. A thin, wet click—like a tongue off metal—sounds once, then stops.

Your comms hiss, and in the static a tight, clipped phrase rides through—human cadence, corporate calm, too close to be ship echo: “—Kade… stand down. Wellness authority—” Then it fractures into dead-channel snow.

Juno freezes halfway in the chase, head turned back toward you. “That wasn’t my rig,” she whispers. “That’s an external tightbeam riding the hull. Helix is *here*—or someone wearing their skin.”

### Turn 104 [PLAYER]

I kill my comms and rip the battery if I can, then shove myself into the chase behind Juno, keeping the rifle tight to my chest. “Move—now. Don’t look back.”  

As I slide in, I hook the torn panel with my boot and drag it back toward the opening to half-cover us, then hiss, “If you hear that ‘wellness’ voice again, ignore it—next order I take from Helix is at muzzle’s length.”

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is starting to open and Helix is trying to command me over comms; I’m not waiting to get boxed in. We have a clear escape route but need to avoid the fiber seals, and I want to deny Helix any easy tracking by going dark.*

### Turn 105 [GAME]

You slap your comms to dead and dig for the power cell. The module’s casing is warm and gritty from being ripped free earlier; the latch fights you for a second, then the battery pops loose. The hiss in your ear vanishes so completely it’s like pressure equalizing—suddenly you can hear your own breath and Juno’s knees knocking rungs.

You shove into the chase behind her, rifle pinned to your chest, elbows tight. The first two fiber seals are right where you saw them; you angle your shoulder and the rifle barrel through the gap without touching. Juno moves when you tell her—fast, careful, no looking back—boots finding rungs by feel.

As you slide in, you hook the torn panel with your boot and drag it toward the opening. It scrapes across the bulkhead lip with a metallic shriek you can’t soften in a space this quiet. The panel catches at an angle, half-covering the bay-side opening—enough to break line of sight, not enough to seal.

**Sensory grounding:** You’re now in the forward service chase, descending “down and starboard.” The air is colder here and tastes like old coolant; your shoulder scrapes conduit insulation that leaves greasy streaks on your sleeve.

Behind the half-covered opening, the recorder bay hatch gives a muffled *chonk*—dogs finally giving way or being defeated by something patient. A thin wedge of bay-light slides across the panel’s edge, then flickers as a shadow passes. You don’t hear footsteps; you hear *contact*—a careful touch on metal, fingertips or tools, mapping the space.

Juno whispers from one rung below, voice tight: “Copy. Ignore Helix. But—Kade—if they’re using wellness authority, they’re not here to arrest. They’re here to bag us.” She pauses, then points down without turning her head. “Baffle cross-passage should be… there—see the junction box with the red microstamp? That’s Helix install work. Means this chase was serviced *after* the derelict was tagged.”

A faint vibration rolls through the chase wall—someone in the bay just set something against the bulkhead, not heavy like a breaching charge… more like a listening puck or a tightbeam coupler finding purchase.

### Turn 106 [PLAYER]

I yank a glowstrip, crack it, and toss it down the chase past Juno to light the rungs and that junction box. “Keep moving—don’t stop for me.”

I pull a frag, thumb it live, and wedge it just inside the bay-side lip behind the half-hung panel—cheap deadman with the spoon pinned by the panel’s pressure. Then I drop down hard after Juno, rifle up, eyes on that red-stamped junction.

*Agent reasoning: Helix is right behind us and setting a device; I’m not letting them track or listen. We need distance fast, but I’ll also booby-trap the choke point to slow pursuit.*

### Turn 107 [GAME]

The glowstrip snaps to life with a chemical *fizz*, a hard green-white that makes the chase feel narrower. It clatters down past Juno’s boots, bounces off a rung, and comes to rest near the red-microstamped junction box—painting the Helix mark in sharp relief and turning drifting dust into a slow snowfall.

Juno doesn’t stop. “Good—light helps. Keep it off your face.” Her voice is breathy, controlled panic. “That box? That’s not just power. That’s a **splice node**—Helix uses them for audit taps. If it’s hot, they can hear us breathe.”

You palm a frag. The chase is too tight for ceremony; you thumb it live and wedge it just inside the bay-side lip behind the half-hung panel. The spoon stays pinned—for now—by the panel’s pressure and the cramped angle. It’s a crude deadman, but it’ll work if the panel shifts.

As you drop hard after Juno, the chase wall shivers—someone in the bay has hands on that panel. Metal scrapes. The half-hung sheet flexes under their touch, and for a second you feel the spoon *want* to spring.

Then the pressure eases. Whoever’s up there goes still, like they sensed the trap without seeing it.

Below, in the glowstrip’s light, the junction box has been opened before: two fasteners are missing, and a thin filament loop hangs out like a stray nerve. A tiny black puck—new, clean—clings to the conduit bundle beside it. Not ship issue. Not old. Its surface has a faint Helix geometric pattern… but the edges are wrong, too organic, like it was grown around the casing.

Juno reaches the level of the box, freezes, and points without touching. “That puck wasn’t here on my last sweep. That’s a **listener**—or something pretending to be one.” She swallows. “If it’s Choir tech, it’ll ‘wake up’ if we talk near it.”

From above, muffled through the panel and bulkhead, a voice leaks in—no comms now, just air-conducted sound: calm, close, and patient. “Rhea Kade. Containment is for your safety.”

### Turn 108 [PLAYER]

I clamp a hand over Juno’s mouth for a second and whisper right in her ear, “No more talking.”  

I jam my knife under the puck and rip it off the conduit, then smash it hard against the rung and stomp it until it’s dead. “Move. Down and starboard—now.”

*Agent reasoning: There’s a Helix listener right where we need to pass, and that “wellness” voice is too close. I’m not negotiating—disable the puck fast and keep moving, and if they touch that panel the frag handles the rest.*

### Turn 109 [GAME]

Your palm clamps over Juno’s mouth; her breath fogs your glove in short, panicked bursts. When you whisper, she nods fast—eyes wide, understanding. She doesn’t fight you, just goes still and smaller, hands white on the rung.

You jam your knife under the puck. It doesn’t pop like adhesive—its edge *threads* into the conduit wrap, like it’s rooted. You rip anyway. It comes free with a wet, rubbery *tear* and a faint squeal that you feel more than hear, vibrating up your wrist.

You smash it against the rung. The casing fractures—and something inside responds.

A thin, translucent filament lashes out, trying to re-anchor to the conduit bundle. You stomp hard. The second stomp does it: the filament snaps, and the puck collapses into inert shards that stop twitching.

**Immediate consequence:** the chase goes quiet for a half-beat… then the bulkhead above you *ticks* with a clean, deliberate knock, like someone acknowledging a signal. Not through comms—through metal. They heard that.

**Sensory grounding:** You’re one deck down in the forward service chase, starboard side, glowstrip glare pooling around the open splice node and the now-smeared rung where the puck died. The air tastes sharper—ozone and bruised plastic.

Juno starts moving again immediately, faster now, keeping her mouth shut. As she drops, she taps your forearm once—hard—then points at the junction box: a hair-thin **tap fiber** runs from it into the conduit bundle, disappearing deeper down the chase. Helix didn’t just install a node; they **ran a line**.

Above, through the half-hung panel, you hear the faint scrape of someone shifting position in the bay, careful not to jostle the panel—careful not to trip your deadman. The “wellness” voice returns, muffled and close, spoken to the bulkhead like it’s listening: “Kade. You’re escalating.”

The glowstrip’s light catches your boot sole: you’ve picked up a smear of the puck’s inner gel—tacky, faintly luminescent. It clings like it wants to travel.

### Turn 110 [PLAYER]

I scrape my boot hard against the rung until the glowing gel smears off, then wipe the blade on the metal too. I slice the tap fiber clean at the junction and yank it back to break slack, then shove Juno’s shoulder down the ladder. “Keep dropping—fast. Next junction we see, we burn it.”

*Agent reasoning: The tap fiber means they’re tracking/listening downline; I’m going to cut it and keep moving fast. The glowing gel on my boot could be a tracer, so I’ll scrape it off before it spreads.*

### Turn 111 [GAME]

You grind your boot on the rung until the tacky glow smears thin and dull, then flakes away in greasy streaks. You wipe the knife on bare metal; the blade leaves a dark line that steams for a second—ozone and hot polymer—then goes clean.

At the junction, you hook the tap fiber with the knife and slice. It parts with almost no resistance, like fishing line—then *snaps back* against the conduit with a sharp twang. You grab the loose end and yank hard to pull slack.

**Immediate outcome:** the fiber doesn’t just come free. It drags something with it—an anchored micro-coupler buried deeper in the conduit wrap. The coupler tears loose with a tiny shower of insulation dust and a muted *pop* that you feel through the ladder. The chase lights don’t change, but the air shifts: a faint pressure flutter as some hidden line depressurizes.

Up in the recorder bay, the half-hung panel shudders—someone touched it reflexively at the sound, then caught themselves. Your deadman frag stays pinned. For now.

**Sensory grounding:** you’re still in the forward service chase, one deck down from the recorder bay lip, starboard side; the glowstrip below paints the ladderwell in sickly green and throws your shadows long and wrong across sweating conduit.

Juno takes the shove and drops fast, boots clanging rungs despite herself. She keeps her mouth shut, but she throws you a look that says *I heard that pop too*. At the next brace, she points down and makes a tight fist—*more nodes*—then slices two fingers across her palm: *cut them*.

From above, the “wellness” voice is gone. In its place: a new sound—soft, rhythmic taps traveling through the hull plates, not random settling. A code. Someone is relaying your position the old way, through metal, because you just killed their clean line.

Down the chase, past Juno’s shoulders, you can see the next junction: another red microstamp on a box cover, but this one has a faint amber sheen around the seam—fresh sealant foam, Helix-grade. Someone has been here recently, and they expected tampering.

### Turn 112 [PLAYER]

I yank Juno down another few rungs, then pull a thermite strip and slap it across the seam of the amber-foamed junction. “Eyes down—move.”  

I spark it and immediately drop fast after her, rifle angled up the chase in case someone follows, not waiting to see it burn.

*Agent reasoning: That sealed junction screams trap; I’m not carefully opening it. I’ll disable it violently and keep us moving before they triangulate us with the hull taps.*

### Turn 113 [GAME]

The thermite strip slaps onto the amber-foamed seam and *sticks* like it was made for it. You spark it and it catches instantly—white-hot, vicious. The foam doesn’t just burn; it *recoils*, blistering and curling away from the seam as the junction cover begins to sag.

You don’t wait. You haul yourself down after Juno, rifle angled up the chase.

Behind you, the thermite’s glare strobes through the ladderwell gaps. The heat punches down the shaft in a quick, dry gust that tastes like scorched sealant and hot copper. A second later, something in the junction gives—a sharp *ping*—and molten drip starts to patter on rungs above your head.

Juno drops fast, shoulders hunched, eyes down like you ordered. She finally speaks, a rasp forced between clenched teeth: “That foam’s a tamper tell. If it was tied to their net, you just bought us… maybe seconds. They’ll know which node went dark.” Then, quieter, almost embarrassed by the fear: “And thermite in a chase—Rhea, you’re going to cook the line insulation.”

Up-chase, the careful scrape in the recorder bay stops being careful. Boots hit metal—someone committing to the ladder. They don’t rush blindly; they pause at the bay lip, just out of sight, like they’re listening to the thermite and judging whether the shaft is about to become a chimney.

The hull-tap code changes tempo—faster, urgent—then abruptly *cuts out*, as if the path they were using just got severed by heat. In the sudden absence of tapping, you hear something else: a thin, distant chime carried through the structure, like a tuning fork struck in another compartment.

**Sensory grounding:** you’re now several rungs below the burning junction, starboard ladderwell dropping into darker service space; the glowstrip above is being overpowered by the thermite’s white flare, throwing hard shadows that jitter with your movement.

**Environmental pressure:** the thermite is turning the chase into a heat column; smoke will pool upward, but the heat will radiate down. If the insulation goes, you could lose power to doors—or light—or trigger a local suppression dump.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Junction seam: burning through  
- Pursuer: on ladder, above  
- Hull-tap tracking: disrupted  
- Chase heat: rising fast

### Turn 114 [PLAYER]

I snarl at Juno, “Then move faster.”  

I shoulder the rifle up the shaft and fire a short burst at the rungs and conduit above the thermite line—aiming to shower them with sparks and force them to back off—then I keep dropping, hunting for the next access hatch or side crawlspace on starboard.

*Agent reasoning: Someone’s coming down the ladder and the chase is turning into an oven; I want to slow the pursuer hard while we drop fast and find an exit hatch.*

### Turn 115 [GAME]

The burst cracks up the shaft—muzzle flash strobes the ladderwell. Rounds chew into rungs and conduit above the thermite line. The effect is immediate: insulation erupts into a bright, angry spray; a conduit jacket splits and spits a shower of sparks that rain down into the heat shimmer.

Up at the bay lip, the pursuer jerks back with a muffled curse. You hear the scrape of boots retreating a half-step, then the hard slap of a glove on metal as they steady themselves. They don’t fall, but they stop advancing—no one wants to climb into a sparkstorm over a thermite burn.

The tradeoff hits right after: the chewed conduit *arcs*—a harsh blue snap—and the ladderwell lights hiccup. For a breath the chase goes dim except for the thermite’s white glare, then emergency strips below pick up, pulsing amber like a sick heartbeat.

You snarl at Juno. She doesn’t argue—just drops faster, hands sliding, boots catching rungs on instinct. “Starboard notch is two decks down,” she spits back, voice tight. “Maintenance crawl—narrow. If it’s still open.”

**Sensory grounding:** you’re mid-drop in the starboard ladderwell; above, the thermite is a white sun in the shaft, below, amber strips strobe over sweating conduit and scattered insulation dust.

As you descend, you spot what you’re hunting: a **starboard side crawlspace hatch** set into the wall—oval, with a recessed wheel latch. Someone has scuffed fresh tool marks into the latch plate, and a thin line of amber foam traces the edge like a seal. Next to it, stamped small: **SP-PORT NOTCH AUX**—wrong label for starboard, like it was hurriedly swapped.

Above, the pursuer’s voice changes—no longer “wellness,” now a clipped operator tone: “Kade. Stand down. That shaft’s about to dump suppression.” As if on cue, a hiss begins far up the chase—valves waking.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Pursuer: forced back
- Conduit: damaged, arcing

### Turn 116 [PLAYER]

I grab Juno by the harness and haul her tight to the hatch. “In. Now.”  
I slam my boot into the wheel latch to break the seal, then crank it hard; if it won’t give, I plant a breaching charge strip on the hinge side and get my shoulder behind Juno to shove her through the moment it pops.

*Agent reasoning: Suppression is about to flood the shaft and the hatch looks freshly sealed/tampered; I need out of the ladderwell now and I’m not negotiating with the pursuer.*

### Turn 117 [GAME]

You hook two fingers into Juno’s harness webbing and yank her tight to the oval hatch. She stumbles, catches herself on the wall, and immediately starts working the recess with shaking hands—more reflex than calm.

Your boot hits the wheel latch with a dull *thunk*. The amber foam seal fractures in a neat ring… and releases a sharp, sweet chemical stench. The wheel gives you a quarter turn, then binds hard like it’s fighting a secondary catch.

You crank anyway. Metal screams. Something inside the latch assembly *pops*—not the hatch, the **tamper pin**—and a thin filament line snaps taut across the seam for a heartbeat before retracting. Juno’s eyes widen. “That was a tell—Helix loves those. Someone’s watching this hatch state.”

Up the ladderwell, the suppression hiss becomes a steady roar, and a cold mist starts to tumble down past the thermite glare—fire and suppressant meeting somewhere above with an ugly, wet sizzle. The air temperature whipsaws: heat on your face, cold on your hands.

The hatch still won’t swing. You plant the breaching strip on the hinge side; it adheres over the foam residue with a tacky rip. As you get your shoulder behind Juno, a voice from above—closer now, lower, no mask—cuts through the shaft: “Don’t. That crawl ties into the spine buffer. You pop it, you’ll vent your own path.”

They’re not bluffing. You can feel a faint draft leaking around the hatch edge now that the seal’s broken—pressure differential, like the crawlspace beyond is *hungrier* than the ladderwell.

Juno swallows hard, voice tight but useful: “If it’s a buffer crawl, it’ll be cramped—cable trays, sharp turns. But it’s cover.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** Starboard ladderwell, two decks below recorder service; amber strips pulse while suppressant mist drifts down like cold fog.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Hatch seal: broken, latch bound  
- Tamper pin: tripped  
- Suppression: dumping above

### Turn 118 [PLAYER]

“Shut up,” I bark up the shaft, then I peel the breaching strip back off the hinge and pocket it.  

I jam the knife into the latch housing and lever hard while I put my shoulder into the hatch—just trying to pop the secondary catch, not blow the door—then I shove Juno through the moment it gives and dive in after her, yanking the wheel to dog it behind us.

*Agent reasoning: Talking’s a waste—suppression and a pursuer mean seconds. If the hatch is a vent risk, I’ll crack it just enough to slip through and reseal behind us rather than full-breach.*

### Turn 119 [GAME]

You bark up the shaft and peel the breaching strip free; it comes off with a wet *rip*, leaving a smear of foam and adhesive. The operator above answers with a tight, angry laugh that cuts off mid-syllable as suppression fog thickens—then you hear them cough, retreating again.

You drive the knife into the latch housing seam and lever. Metal bites metal. Your shoulder hits the hatch and you *feel* the secondary catch flex—then resist—then finally give with a sharp *clack* like a snapped tooth.

The hatch pops inward a handspan. A hungry draft yanks at loose insulation dust and pulls it into the dark beyond.

“In—NOW,” you snarl, and Juno doesn’t hesitate. She folds and slides through the oval, boots scraping cable tray. You follow, hauling yourself in by the rim, then reach back and spin the wheel hard. It dogs down, but not cleanly; the latch grinds like it’s half-stripped. Still, the hatch seals enough to change the sound: the ladderwell becomes muffled, distant, full of wet suppression hiss and far-off shouting.

**Sensory grounding:** You’re inside the starboard AUX crawlspace—knee-to-hip high, packed with cable trays and coolant lines; the air is colder, with a sweet metallic tang, and condensation beads on your gloves.

Juno is pressed ahead of you, breathing loud, one hand over her mouth. She whispers without looking back: “This crawl runs parallel to SPINE-2 buffer trunks. If they’re smart, they’ll try to cut us off at the next junction—there’s a service drop with a manual dog bar socket.”

Behind the hatch, something heavy hits the wheel from the ladderwell side—testing. Not a frantic slam. A measured shove, then a pause, like they’re listening for the latch’s weak point. Over that, the ship answers with its own wrong noise: a faint, far chime through the pipes, and then a soft *tick-tick* in the crawl’s wall—like someone tapping *from inside the metal*, keeping time.

Further down-crawl, a grated side access panel sits slightly proud of its frame, held with two fasteners that look recently disturbed. A dim service marker light beyond it pulses once… twice… then holds steady, as if it sensed your entry.

**Status updates**
- Breach strip: recovered

### Turn 120 [PLAYER]

I shove Juno forward. “Crawl. Now. No stops.”  

I slide to that proud grated side panel, knife up, and yank the fasteners loose to peek inside—rifle ready to light up anything in there—then I move hard toward the next junction looking for that manual dog-bar socket so we can bar it shut behind us.

*Agent reasoning: They’re probing the hatch and might force it; I want distance and an ambush point fast. The disturbed side panel could be a bypass or a trap—check it quick, then move to the dog-bar junction Juno mentioned.*

### Turn 122 [PLAYER]

I shove Juno forward. “Crawl. Now. No stops.”  

I rip the fasteners off the proud grated panel with the knife and wrench it open just enough to clear a sightline, rifle trained into the gap. If it’s clear, I snap it back down and push hard toward the next junction, hunting for the manual dog-bar socket so I can slam a bar in and lock it behind us.

*Agent reasoning: We can’t afford a surprise out of that panel or get cut off at the next junction—check fast, then secure our rear with the dog-bar socket.*

### Turn 123 [GAME]

Juno scrambles ahead on elbows and knees, boots kicking cable ties loose. “Copy—no stops,” she breathes, voice thin with panic but moving fast.

You hook the knife under the first fastener and twist. It shears with a brittle *ping*—recently stressed metal. The second fights; you wrench harder and it tears free, scraping your knuckles. The grated panel lifts just enough to give you a sightline.

Your rifle light cuts into a narrow service void: a stubby junction box, bundled fiber, and—most important—**a small Helix tightbeam repeater puck** zip-tied to the frame, its status LED dimmed under a smear of grease. It isn’t inert. It’s in a low-power listen mode.

As your beam hits it, the puck’s LED flares once—like an eye opening—then drops back to dim. A faint chirp rides the metal, not through comms: a contact handshake.

From behind you, through the re-dogged hatch, the measured pressure stops. Then you hear a tool bite metal—someone starting to **work the wheel** instead of testing it.

You snap the grate back down and shove forward, shoulder and hips sliding through the cold, sweating crawl. Ten meters on, the crawl widens into a junction collar where lines split around a buffer trunk. On the bulkhead: a recessed **manual dogging socket** with paint worn off in a crescent from repeated use. The socket’s cover plate is already flipped open—like someone expected you.

Juno glances back, eyes huge in your light. “That’s not… standard. Helix only leaves those open when they want a door barred fast.”

Under your knees, the hull gives you that wrong rhythm again—*tick… tick-tick*—now closer, answering your movement like it’s keeping pace inside the walls.

**Sensory grounding:** Buffer-adjacent junction collar; cold condensation drips from coolant lines onto the back of your neck.

### Turn 124 [PLAYER]

“Quit thinking—move,” I hiss at Juno, then I slam my dog-bar into the manual socket and crank it hard to lock the junction behind us.  

As soon as it bites, I backtrack just enough to rip open that grated panel again and smash the tightbeam puck off its zip-ties, crushing it under my boot before shoving forward after Juno, rifle up, eyes on the next split.

*Agent reasoning: They’re tracking us and closing in; I need to deny pursuit and stop the repeater from calling friends. Bar the junction, then smash the puck and keep moving.*

### Turn 125 [GAME]

The dogging bar slides into the manual socket like it belongs there. You crank hard—shoulder and back—until the mechanism *bites* with a deep, satisfying clunk that vibrates up your arms. Somewhere behind you, metal complains as a pressure door or junction iris seats. The crawlspace acoustics change again: the distant hatch work becomes duller, more frustrated.

Juno jolts at the sound and surges forward. “Good—keep it between us and them,” she pants. Then, quieter, like she hates that she knows this: “If Helix wired that puck, they’ll notice it go dark. If it wasn’t Helix… they’ll notice faster.”

You backtrack on a hard scramble, rip the grate again, and tear into the zip-ties with the knife. The puck comes free with a sticky snap—warm against your glove, like it’s been drawing power from the frame. You bring your boot down.

It doesn’t shatter like cheap plastic. It *cracks*, then emits a thin, ugly squeal that isn’t on comms—more like feedback through the ship’s bones. The LED strobes three times, too bright, and dies. Under your boot, something inside the puck pulses once—like a tiny heartbeat—then goes still.

From the sealed junction behind the dogged point: a single heavy impact, testing the new lock. It holds. A second impact follows, then scraping—someone switching tools again, irritated.

**Sensory grounding:** You’re back in the starboard AUX crawl, pushing forward toward the next split; the air tastes like cold copper and crushed insulation, and your rifle light turns the condensation into drifting glitter.

Ahead, the crawl divides around a thicker trunk line and a service tag plate stamped with Helix microtext—partially peeled away, like someone tried to remove it. Juno pauses just long enough to point with two shaking fingers: “Next split feeds the buffer collar—if we go wrong, we dead-end into a pressure bladder. If the ship starts cycling, we’ll feel it before we hear it.”

The *tick… tick-tick* in the walls has changed cadence—less like tapping, more like something keeping pace just out of sight.

**Status updates**
- Junction: manually dogged (holding)

### Turn 126 [PLAYER]

“Buffer collar route. Move.” I shove Juno down the correct split and take rear, rifle up, sweeping the seams and listening for that ticking. “If you feel cycling, you scream—don’t think.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re getting herded; I’m not letting some unseen thing pace us. Pick the route that avoids the pressure bladder, keep moving, and be ready to ambush anything coming alongside in the walls.*

### Turn 127 [GAME]

Juno doesn’t argue. She drops into the buffer-collar split and claws forward fast, shoulders scraping conduit. You take rear, rifle up, muzzle tracking seam lines and cable runs where something could be nested or watching.

The crawl tightens, then opens into a ribbed collar section—**Buffer Junction Collar**, starboard side—where the ship’s structure thickens around a pressure interface. The air is colder here, sharper with ozone; condensation beads on the ribs and runs in thin lines like sweat.

The ticking is louder. Not behind you—**above and slightly forward**, traveling through the collar ribs. Your light catches a hairline vibration in a coolant line clamp, like the metal’s being “played” from the other side.

Juno suddenly freezes. You see it in her posture before she speaks: fingers splayed on the deck plating, feeling. “Rhea—” she whispers, then forces it out the way you ordered, loud and ugly: “**CYCLING!**”

A low, sub-audible thrum rolls through the collar. It’s not a full pressure shift yet—more like a system waking up and taking a breath. Your ears pop a fraction. The ribs around you answer with a sympathetic *ping* as the structure loads.

Behind you, through the split you came from, the sound of toolwork stops. In its place: a single soft knock, deliberate, like someone tapping to be let in.

Juno keeps moving but talks as she crawls, voice shaking: “If the buffer bladder starts to inflate, it’ll squeeze this run. Helix designs it to force evac routes one-way during fires. Someone can trigger it from a service bay—if they’ve got access.”

Ahead, the collar’s far end shows a **manual dog cover** and a faded stencil: *SPINE-2 / RECORDER SERVICE — PRESSURE DOOR CORRIDOR*—but the stencil has been overpainted once, then scratched back open with something sharp. Fresh.

**Status updates**
- Route: buffer collar confirmed
- Cycling: initiated (low thrum)
- Pursuer: toolwork ceased; knocking begins

### Turn 128 [PLAYER]

“Keep crawling—don’t stop for anything.”  

I surge forward to that manual dog cover at the far end and wrench it open, trying to dog the pressure door corridor side shut behind us as soon as Juno clears. As we move, I rake my rifle light up at the vibrating clamp and put a short burst into the seam above it, then keep pushing.

*Agent reasoning: Cycling means we’re about to get crushed or funneled; I’m not waiting. I’ll push through to the pressure door corridor and lock it down, and if something’s in the ribs making that ticking, I’ll put rounds into the seam to discourage it.*

### Turn 129 [GAME]

You surge past Juno, fingers finding the edge of the manual dog cover. It’s stiff—iced with condensation and old sealant—but it gives with a tearing squeal. The socket underneath is already aligned; you jam the SPINE-2 bar in and crank.

The mechanism fights you for half a turn—then **catches**. A heavy internal cam rolls over and the corridor-side pressure door somewhere ahead/adjacent answers with a muffled *WHUMPH* as it seats. The collar’s thrum wavers like you’ve interrupted a cycle command.

“Clear—CLEAR!” Juno shouts, kicking through the last ribbed ring and into the next space.

You rake your rifle light up at the vibrating clamp and fire a short burst into the seam above it. In the tight collar the shots are deafening; muzzle flash turns the condensation into a white storm. The rounds chew a ragged line into plating—sparks, flaked insulation, a brief spray of frost.

Then something *moves* in the seam: not a body—more like a **thin filament bundle** snapping back from impact. It retracts fast, and the ticking stutters, skipping a beat like a metronome slapped off tempo.

The collar answers with a sudden **pressure-shift groan**. Not full compression, but enough that your suit fabric tightens on your shoulders and the air feels “thicker.” The cycling hasn’t stopped; it’s adapting.

You push through after Juno into the **SPINE-2 / Recorder Service pressure-door corridor**—a narrow passage with amber strips and a smeared wall of handprints that look fresh under your light. Behind you, at the collar end, the dogged mechanism holds… for now.

From back the way you came: the soft knocking stops. A new sound replaces it—**a slow, careful scraping**, like someone drawing something thin along the metal to find a gap.

Juno grabs the corridor rail, eyes wide, and forces words through clenched teeth. “That door—if they’re on the other side when the buffer inflates, they’ll either back off… or they’ll vent it to get in.”

**Status updates**
- Pressure-door corridor: entered
- Manual dog: engaged, holding

### Turn 130 [PLAYER]

I slam my palm on the corridor wall and bark back toward the dogged collar, “Try that door and I’ll cut you in half the second it opens!”

Then I grab Juno’s harness and shove her forward. “Recorder service—move. Find a panel, any override.” I sweep the corridor for a local control box or emergency manual for the pressure system, rifle tracking the rear seam as I back us toward the next access.

*Agent reasoning: Something’s probing the seam behind us and the buffer cycle is still active; I want a hard barrier and a new route fast. I’ll threaten anyone following, then push Juno toward the recorder service while I check for a local control to kill cycling or vent them instead.*

### Turn 131 [GAME]

Your palm hits the corridor wall with a hollow clang that rings down the ribs. You bark the threat into the dogged collar—and for a half second the scraping on the far side stops, like whoever’s there is listening.

Then a reply comes back, not over comms—through the metal, faint and intimate, as if the corridor itself is speaking around your words: a soft, layered murmur that almost matches your cadence. Not a sentence you can parse. More like an imitation.

Juno flinches hard at it. You grab her harness and shove; she stumbles forward, catches herself on a smeared handprint, and forces her boots to move again. “Panel—yeah—” she says, voice thin. “There should be a local pressure interlock. Helix likes redundant control in recorder corridors for audit teams.”

You back them toward the next access, rifle tracking the rear seam. Your light sweeps over a recessed **yellow control box** half-hidden behind a dangling insulation curtain: *PRESSURE INTERLOCK / CORRIDOR ISOLATION*. Its faceplate is scuffed and has a fresh pry mark at one corner—someone’s been in it recently. A manual pull-tab sits under a cracked plastic cover, and a status strip shows **AMBER: AUTO-CYCLE ARMED**.

Down-corridor toward Recorder Service, the amber strips pulse out of sync for a beat—then resync, like the system just accepted a new state. The air goes a shade colder, and you feel that low thrum again, closer to a breath being held.

Behind you, at the dogged collar: the scraping resumes, but slower now—careful, patient. Something taps twice in a new spot, higher up, like it found a different seam to worry.

Juno crouches by the box without fully turning her back to the corridor. “If I pop this, we might be able to force *manual hold*—but if the bladder’s already being commanded from service bay, it’ll fight us. And if there’s a remote override keyed to Helix badges… I don’t have one. You do.” Her eyes flick to the **Helix Audit badge strip** on your kit.

**Sensory grounding:** You’re in the SPINE-2 Recorder Service pressure-door corridor, collar door dogged behind you; the wall under your hand is wet with condensation and faintly tacky, like old sealant.

**Status updates**
- Corridor interlock box: located  
- Dogged collar: held, probed  
- Cycling: armed, escalating

### Turn 132 [PLAYER]

“Hands off, Juno. Cover your face and get up-corridor—now.”

I keep my rifle angled back toward the dogged collar with one hand, and with the other I slap my Helix Audit badge strip against the control box reader area and yank the cracked cover open. “Manual hold. Right now,” I growl, and if it hesitates I ram the pull-tab hard and start tearing into the faceplate with the knife like I’m opening a ration tin.

*Agent reasoning: I’m not letting the ship squeeze us or some mimic-thing talk through the walls; I’ll force the system into manual and keep my gun on the backtrail. If the box was pried, it might be booby-trapped, so I’ll make Juno stand off while I use my badge and brute force.*

### Turn 133 [GAME]

The badge strip slaps the reader pad. For a heartbeat nothing happens—then the control box gives a dry little chirp and the status strip flips from **AMBER: AUTO-CYCLE ARMED** to **GREEN: AUDIT OVERRIDE — LOCAL AUTH**.

You yank the cracked cover open. Cold air spills out of the box like it’s been refrigerated. You hit the pull-tab hard.

**Immediate outcome:** the corridor’s low thrum cuts off mid-breath. The pressure in your ears releases with a tiny *click*, like a seal relaxing. Somewhere behind you, in the collar, the structure stops “loading” and the dogged door’s seated *WHUMPH* becomes a steady, confident silence—no longer fighting a system trying to cycle it.

Juno obeys instantly—up-corridor, forearm over her mouth and nose, eyes on you. “Good—good,” she hisses. “That means the override key’s still recognized. If Helix pushed a remote command, you just locally vetoed it.”

You start to tear into the faceplate anyway—knife tip under the scuffed corner—when the box protests: a rising alarm tone, not loud but sharp, and a new line of text strobes across the strip: **TAMPER DETECT — LOGGING**. The metal under your blade is softer than it should be, like composite over a steel frame; it peels in ugly curls.

Behind you, at the dogged collar, the careful scraping stops again. Then comes a single, gentle knock… from the *corridor side* of the door. Not possible unless something is in the door cavity or the wall.

Your rifle light catches the smeared handprints on the corridor wall: one of them is slowly **wetting**, as if fresh fluid is seeping out of the pores of the metal.

Juno points down-corridor with a stiff, shaking finger. “Recorder Service bay’s ahead—if we can get inside and hard-isolate, this corridor becomes a kill tube. But—Rhea—whatever’s back there heard you. It’s learning the rules.”

**Sensory grounding:** You’re in the SPINE-2 Recorder Service pressure-door corridor, back to the dogged collar; the control box is open in your left hand, knife biting into its faceplate, amber strips pulsing overhead.

**Status updates**
- Auto-cycle: overridden (local)

### Turn 134 [PLAYER]

I stop carving the faceplate and snap the box shut, then step back from the wetting handprint and put two rounds into the wall right beside it. “Juno—Recorder Service bay, NOW. Get it open and start hard-isolate.”  

I backpedal after her, rifle locked on the dogged collar end. “Anything moves in that seam, I’m burning it—don’t hesitate.”

*Agent reasoning: The override bought us time; the door-cavity knock and wetting wall means something’s already in this corridor. I’m not letting it flank us—push to Recorder Service and turn this hall into a kill zone while I watch the rear.*

### Turn 135 [GAME]

You stop carving and **snap the control box shut**. The alarm tone cuts off immediately, but the status strip on its face still blinks a tiny **RED DOT: TAMPER LOGGED** before dimming. The local override remains in effect—GREEN stays steady.

You step back from the wetting handprint and fire **two tight rounds** into the wall beside it. The impacts punch ragged craters through paint and into the honeycomb backing; a mist of condensation and metallic dust puffs outward. The “wet” smear spasms—like something recoiling under skin—and then **goes still**, the seep slowing to a thin bead that clings to the print’s ridges.

Juno bolts down-corridor at your order, boots slapping tacky deck. “On it—hard isolate means sealing the service bay door and killing corridor equalization,” she throws back without looking. “If Helix wired this like standard, there’s a physical dog on the bay side too. If it’s been… modified, I’ll need cover.”

You backpedal after her, rifle fixed on the dogged collar end. The corridor behind you is narrower than it felt a minute ago—amber strips pulsing overhead, shadows lagging half a beat.

At the collar door seam, something finally **shows itself**: a hair-thin filament—almost invisible—slides out from the upper gasket, tasting the air like a feeler. It doesn’t rush you. It **tests** the space, drifting toward the bullet-pocked wall, then retracts when your light catches it, snapping back with a faint *zip*.

Ahead, the **Recorder Service bay pressure door** comes into view—white Helix paint, scuffed, with an embedded badge reader and a manual wheel lock. The reader’s indicator is **dark**, like it’s on local power only. Juno reaches it, breath hard, and palms the seam. “Door’s cold. No active heat. If it’s stuck, it’s stuck for a reason.”

Behind you, from the collar, the impossible knock returns—this time not a knock: a **soft, rhythmic tapping** that matches the amber pulse for three beats… then falls out of sync, as if it’s trying different tempos.

**Sensory grounding:** You’re mid-corridor between the interlock box (behind your left shoulder) and the Recorder Service bay door (ahead), with the dogged collar door at your rear.

**Status updates**
- Interlock override: holding (green)
- Wall seep: suppressed, not gone
- Filament probe: confirmed at seam
- Recorder bay door: reached (power-dark)

### Turn 136 [PLAYER]

“Juno, spin that wheel—if it binds, we’re breaking it. Don’t wait for ‘permission.’”

I plant myself between her and the collar, rifle up, and the second that filament peeks again I hose the upper gasket with a short, controlled burst. “Door, now—before it figures out a new trick.”

*Agent reasoning: The filament is probing and the bay door looks unpowered; I need Juno working the door while I keep the seam suppressed, and if the reader’s dead we brute-force the wheel/dog.*

### Turn 137 [GAME]

Juno grabs the wheel with both hands and throws her weight into it. It resists—then gives with a gritty *clack-clack*, like the dogs are peeling free one by one. “Binding,” she snaps through her sleeve, “but it’s moving—keep it off me.”

The filament peeks from the upper gasket at the collar end again, thin as a hair and too straight to be organic. You answer with a short, controlled burst.

**Immediate outcome:** rounds chew through the upper gasket channel and the surrounding frame. The filament whips back so fast it leaves a faint, wet thread across the metal—then it’s gone. But your burst also shreds the gasket’s integrity; a cold hiss starts up, and the corridor air takes on a sharp, sweet-ozone bite as pressure begins to **bleed** through the damaged seal.

Juno gets the wheel to full release and shoulder-checks the door. It cracks open a handspan—then stops, caught on something inside. Not a latch. Something soft, dragging. The gap exhales a stale breath that smells like overheated plastic and old antiseptic.

She wedges her boot and forces it wider. In the slit of darkness beyond, your light catches **filament netting** strung across the threshold like a spiderweb, anchored to the door’s inner lip. Someone—something—has been using the bay as a trap mouth.

Juno recoils, eyes wide. “That’s not standard Helix. That’s… rigging.” She yanks a compact manual dog lever from the bay-side jamb and slams it down. “Hard isolate—if this lever still talks to the bay seals, we can cut the corridor out.”

Behind you, the collar door answers with that rhythmic tap again—only now it’s accompanied by a faint, muffled *scrape* moving along the inside of the seam you just shot, like it’s searching for an undamaged edge.

**Sensory grounding:** You’re braced in the Recorder Service corridor, back to the collar; Juno is half-in, half-out of the Recorder Service bay doorway, forcing it against filament webbing while your rifle light stutters over torn gasket foam and drifting dust.

**Status updates**
- Recorder bay door: un-dogged, jammed by netting
- Collar gasket: suppressed, but leaking
- Corridor pressure: slowly bleeding
- Hard isolate: lever engaged (uncertain response)

### Turn 138 [PLAYER]

“Net’s in the way—cut it and get inside. Don’t touch it bare.”

I step in close, slash at the filament webbing with my knife in fast, brutal strokes, then shoulder the door through the gap. “Juno—move!” As soon as she clears, I lunge after her and start dogging the bay door shut behind us, rifle snapping back toward the corridor seam between pulls.

*Agent reasoning: The corridor’s bleeding and the bay doorway is trapped; I need Juno inside and the corridor sealed. I’ll cut the netting fast and force the door, then fall in and dog it shut to isolate from whatever’s probing the collar seam.*

### Turn 139 [GAME]

Your knife hits the filament webbing and it **doesn’t cut like cord**—it cuts like pressure tape under tension. The first two strokes shear a few strands and the whole lattice **snaps inward** toward the blade, trying to wrap it. You rip your wrist back and keep slashing, fast and ugly. The webbing parts in clumps, recoiling and sticking to itself instead of spraying out.

**Immediate outcome:** the doorway clears enough to force through. Juno ducks under your shoulder and stumbles into the bay, coughing. “It’s reactive—don’t let it get on skin,” she gasps, and shoves her sleeve over her hand as she grabs the inner jamb for balance. You shoulder the door hard; it grinds past the last of the netting with a wet squeal.

You lunge after her and start dogging the bay door shut. The wheel fights you—then turns, dogs thudding home one by one. Between pulls you snap the rifle back toward the corridor seam.

Through the narrowing crack, you catch a last glimpse of the corridor: the upper gasket you hosed is **frayed and smoking**, and something thin and pale is **threading along the ceiling line**, feeling for the door gap. When the final dog seats, it makes a deep *CHUNK*—and the thing outside **hits the door once**, not a knock but a full-body bump that bows the metal a millimeter and makes the wheel shiver under your palm.

Inside the Recorder Service bay, the air is colder and drier—less sweet-ozone, more dust and antiseptic. Your light sweeps racks of recorder service gear and a sealed core cabinet with Helix microstamps; a thin film of condensation has been wiped away in **hand-sized arcs**, recent. Juno backs away from the threshold, eyes locked on your knife hand. “Blade,” she says tight. “Check it—if that filament’s on there, it’ll crawl when it warms.”

The door’s perimeter seal tries to inflate… then hesitates, like it’s waiting on a command that isn’t coming. Somewhere in the bay wall, a relay clicks twice—uncertain, searching.

**Sensory grounding:** You’re now *inside* SPINE-2 Recorder Service Bay, back to the just-dogged pressure door; corridor noise is muffled to dull impacts.

**Status updates**
- Recorder bay: entered, door dogged
- Filament net: partially cut, recoiled
- Bay seal: sluggish/uncertain
- Corridor threat: pressed to door

### Turn 140 [PLAYER]

I wipe the knife hard on my sleeve, then slam it into a metal bench and step on the blade spine to scrape anything off. “Juno—find the manual seal/pressure panel and force inflate. If it needs power, hotwire it.”  

I keep my rifle trained on the door wheel and seam. “If that door bows again, I’m putting rounds through the hinges.”

*Agent reasoning: That filament is a contamination risk and the door seal is failing; I need to isolate the bay and keep the thing outside from finding a way in. I’ll deal with the knife fast, then force the bay seal and look for a manual pressure control.*

### Turn 141 [GAME]

You wipe the knife hard on your sleeve, then **drive it into the edge of a metal bench**. When you step on the spine and lever it, the blade screeches—bright, ugly—shearing off a translucent smear that had started to cling along the bevel. It doesn’t “crawl,” not in the open, but the scrap you peel away **tightens into a little tacky curl** like warmed adhesive. Your sleeve takes a faintly sweet, chemical stink where you wiped it.

Juno’s already moving, shoulders hunched, keeping her hands off anything glossy. She finds a recessed panel stenciled **BAY SEAL / LOCAL PRESS** behind a service rack and pops it with the heel of her badge strip. Inside: a manual hand-pump bulb, a gauge needle sitting dead low, and a small power bus with two scorched jump posts. “Manual inflate exists,” she says, voice thin. “But the solenoid’s not taking commands. Either the bay’s been de-authorized… or the control line’s cut.”

Outside the door, something **drags** along the seam—slow, patient—then stops right where the wheel hub meets the plate, as if it’s listening for vibration. The metal bows a fraction again, not a slam this time: a steady push that makes the dogs creak.

Juno slaps the hand-pump bulb and starts working it hard. The gauge twitches upward in reluctant ticks. “If I can get it to hold pressure, it’ll stiffen the seal,” she mutters. “If it’s punctured, we’ll hear it sing.”

Your rifle stays trained on the wheel and hinge line. In the bay’s back corner, your light catches the **core recorder cabinet**—Helix microstamps intact—but its access screws are freshly disturbed, slots chewed like someone used the wrong tool in a hurry. Overhead, a vent grille is slightly cocked, as if it’s been removed and replaced fast.

A relay behind the pressure panel clicks once—then, faintly, the perimeter gasket **inflates** in sections with a soft rubbery sigh.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** Inside SPINE-2 Recorder Service Bay, you’re posted three steps from the dogged door; cold, dry air and antiseptic dust bite your throat.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Knife: scraped clean (mostly)  
- Bay seal: partially inflating  
- Door pressure: increasing outside  
- Core cabinet: tampered screws

### Turn 142 [PLAYER]

“Keep pumping—don’t stop till that gauge is solid.”

I sidestep to the vent grille, rifle up, and jab it with the muzzle. “Juno, eyes up—if anything drops from that vent, shoot it.” Then I move to the core cabinet and yank hard on it; if it doesn’t open clean, I’m ripping the screws out with my knife and forcing it.

*Agent reasoning: The thing’s probing the door and we’ve got a vent and cabinet that scream “someone’s already inside.” I’ll secure the bay fast, then clear the vent/cabinet before we get flanked.*

### Turn 143 [GAME]

Juno keeps pumping, jaw clenched. The gauge climbs past the first hash and steadies. “It’s holding,” she says, breathy. “Not great—*holding*.”

You sidestep under the vent grille and jab it with the rifle muzzle. The grille **shifts** with a hollow rattle—wasn’t fully seated. A dust fall sprinkles your barrel and helmet. For half a second nothing happens… then a thin, translucent strand **drops like spit** from the vent lip, stretching toward the muzzle as if it recognizes warmth.

Juno’s head snaps up. She doesn’t fire—too close to you—but she barks, “Rhea—back off it, it’s *threading!*”

At the bay door behind you, something leans in again. The metal creaks, but the partially inflated gasket now **resists**, turning the push into a low groan instead of a bow. The wheel trembles under the pressure like a living thing is breathing against it.

You move to the core cabinet and yank. It doesn’t open—Helix’s core housing is keyed and mechanically latched. The tampered screws strip further under your hand pressure, confirming someone already tried to brute it.

You jam the knife into the first chewed screw slot and twist. The screw **pops** with a sharp metallic snap, and a flake of microstamp lacquer skitters away. Two more screws give, ugly but workable—until the knife edge hits a patch of that tacky filament residue you missed. It grabs the blade for an instant, slowing your leverage, and you feel the cabinet vibrate as if something inside is **spinning up** or reacting to the disturbance.

Juno keeps pumping, eyes flicking between the vent and your hands. “If we crack that cabinet wrong, it may dump the buffer—or wipe. Helix builds them to die clean.”

**Sensory grounding:** Recorder Service Bay, core cabinet on the forward wall; vent grille overhead to your left; dogged bay door behind you groaning under outside pressure.

**Status updates**
- Bay seal: inflating, holding pressure  
- Vent: filament strand active  
- Core cabinet: screws breaking free

### Turn 144 [PLAYER]

I jerk back from the vent and fire a tight two-round burst straight into the grille, then swing my boot up and kick it shut into its frame. “Vent’s hostile—leave it.”

I slap the rifle to low-ready and jam my knife back into the cabinet seam like a prybar. “Juno, keep pumping and watch that damn door—if it moves, put a round through the wheel hub.” Then I rip the remaining screws out and wrench the core cabinet open, hard.

*Agent reasoning: The vent filament is an immediate threat and the door pressure could turn into a breach; I need to kill the vent strand fast and get the cabinet open before it wipes, but I’ll force it anyway—no time for finesse.*

### Turn 145 [GAME]

The two-round burst punches into the vent grille with a flat *WHUMP-WHUMP* and a spray of shredded mesh and dust. Something inside the duct **recoils fast**, not a body so much as a bundled line snapping back. You bring your boot up and kick—metal rings, the grille bites into its frame and seats crooked but **closed**. The dangling filament strand vanishes into the slit as it pinches shut.

**Immediate outcome:** the vent threat is suppressed for the moment; the duct goes quiet except for a faint, far-off ticking like cooling metal.

You drop the rifle to low-ready and drive your knife into the core cabinet seam like a prybar. The steel lip flexes; the cabinet shudders as you rip the remaining screws out one by one—each one coming free with an ugly squeal, the last stripping and then popping out in your fingers.

Juno doesn’t argue. She plants herself by the pressure panel, keeps pumping with one hand, and with the other brings her sidearm up toward the bay door. “Gauge is climbing—seal’s stiffening,” she says. Then, quieter: “Wheel hub’s hardened. A round might not break it… but it’ll *tell it we’re awake*.”

At your command, she tracks the wheel. The door gives another long push from the other side, but the inflated gasket now holds; the dogs creak without slipping.

You wrench the cabinet door hard. It **breaks free**—not cleanly. A secondary latch tears with a brittle snap and the door swings open a handspan… and a thin internal baffle plate **drops** like a guillotine, stopping your reach and exposing the core cradle behind it: Helix’s recorder module in a shock cage, and a **warm raw buffer cartridge port** that matches the one in your palm.

The moment the cabinet opens, a tiny status LED inside flickers from dead to dim amber. A speaker you didn’t notice emits a half-second of garbled tone—almost like a throat clearing.

Juno flinches at the sound. “That’s not supposed to have power,” she says, eyes wide, still covering the wheel. “Rhea—something’s back-feeding the bay bus.”

**Sensory grounding:** You’re at the forward wall core cabinet, door hanging half-open; vent grille above-left is now kicked shut; Juno is three meters behind you at the pressure panel with pistol on the dog wheel.

**Status updates**
- Vent grille: shot, forced shut  
- Core cabinet: forced open (partial)  
- Recorder cradle: exposed behind baffle

### Turn 146 [PLAYER]

“Then we take it before it takes us.”

I jam the knife under the baffle and lever it up hard, then shove the warm buffer cartridge into the port. “Juno—keep that seal up and stay on the wheel. If it twitches, shoot it. If the vent pops, I’m hosing it again.”

I lean in close to the cradle. “How long to pull a dump off this thing—seconds or minutes?”

*Agent reasoning: The cabinet waking up means we’re on a clock and something’s on the line; I want the data now and I’m not letting the door or vent surprise us. Force the baffle, seat the buffer, rip whatever dump we can, and be ready to shoot the door hardware if it gives.*

### Turn 147 [GAME]

You hook the knife under the baffle and heave. The plate fights—spring-loaded and meant to shear blades—but your leverage wins with a shriek of metal. The baffle lifts just enough to bare the cartridge port.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the warm buffer cartridge seats with a hard, satisfying *clack*. The amber LED inside the cradle brightens to a steady glow… then pulses in a pattern that’s uncomfortably close to a heartbeat. A low tone rolls out of the cabinet speaker—half modem, half voice—followed by a burst of static that resolves into a single clipped syllable you can’t quite place.

Juno keeps the pump going, one-handed now, pistol locked on the wheel hub. “Seal’s at mid-green,” she says. “And the hub—Rhea, it’s vibrating. Not moving. Like something’s *testing* it.” She swallows, eyes flicking once to the vent you shot shut. “If that duct opens, I’m not wasting rounds—I’m foaming it.”

Up close, the cradle is warm enough to fog your breath against the cabinet lip. The shock cage tremors as the recorder spins up; your cartridge in the port **heats another notch**, as if it’s being written to aggressively. On the inner wall, a Helix service tag reads: **SPINE-2 CORE / RECORDER SERVICE — DUMP MODE REQUIRES AUTH HANDSHAKE**. Under it, someone has scratched a crude line through the word *AUTH*.

From the bay door: a new sound—**a soft, wet tap** against the metal, not pressure. Like fingertips, slow and patient, feeling for seams.

Juno answers your question without looking away from the wheel. “If it’s a clean dump and it accepts the cartridge—**seconds** for a priority burst, **minutes** for full telemetry. If it’s fighting you—” she nods at the pulsing LED, “—it can stretch forever or wipe itself.”

The recorder tone spikes briefly, and the cartridge port light flickers as if the system just recognized *something* about what you plugged in.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** Forward wall, core cabinet open at chest height; Juno is behind you at the pressure panel; the bay door is aft, groaning under intermittent contact.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Buffer cartridge: seated, heating  
- Recorder: active, pulsing output  
- Bay seal: mid-green, holding  
- Door: pressure replaced by tapping

### Turn 148 [PLAYER]

I stab a finger at the service tag and snarl at the cabinet, “No handshake—burst dump, now,” then start ripping at the panel for a manual override or “PRIORITY/EMERG” switch. “Juno—if that tapping turns into torque, shoot the hub and I’m blowing the hinges.”

*Agent reasoning: We don’t have time for a full dump and that tapping means the thing outside is adapting; I’m going to force a priority burst and be ready to kill the door if it tries anything.*

### Turn 149 [GAME]

You rip at the inner paneling around the cradle, hunting for a mechanical bypass. Helix didn’t make it easy—but they did make it *serviceable*. Behind a thin access flap (secured with two quarter-turn fasteners) you find a recessed toggle under a cracked plastic guard: **EMERG / MAINT — “PRIORITY EXTRACT (60s)”**.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** you slap the guard aside and throw the toggle.

The recorder answers with a hard click and a rising whine. The amber LED stops “beating” and shifts to a fast strobe. Your buffer cartridge jumps from warm to **hot**, heat bleeding through your glove. The cabinet speaker spits compressed data noise… and then, threaded through it, a familiar fragment under the static—your own unit’s cadence, call-signs mangled but *there*, like a memory played through broken teeth.

Behind you, the tapping on the bay door changes. It stops—one breath of silence—then the wheel hub gives a tiny, deliberate **twitch**.

Juno fires instantly. The shot cracks in the small bay, muzzle flash bleaching her face. The round punches the wheel hub dead center; metal flakes burst and the hub jerks back, torque interrupted. “It tried to turn,” she says, voice tight. “Not settling. *Turning.*”

The seal holds, but the gasket groans like it’s being kneaded from the other side. The vent grille above-left shivers once in its frame—your kick holding it shut, barely.

Close in at the cabinet, you smell hot polymer and ozone. The cartridge port light flips to **amber-white**, and a tiny line of text on the service strip scrolls: **PRIORITY EXTRACT — PACKETIZING…** then **AUTH BYPASS ACCEPTED** (like someone already taught it to lie).

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re braced at the forward wall cabinet, knife still wedged under the lifted baffle; Juno is aft-left at the pump, pistol smoking, sightline pinned to the damaged wheel hub.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Priority extract: engaged, active  
- Buffer cartridge: rapidly heating  
- Door hub: shot, torque interrupted  
- Vent grille: shivering, closed

### Turn 150 [PLAYER]

I shove my shoulder into the cabinet frame to steady it and bark, “Sixty seconds—hold!”  

I yank a chem-cool pack from my kit and clamp it against the buffer cartridge housing to keep it from cooking, then snap my rifle up toward the bay door. “Juno, on my mark—if that wheel twitches again, put two more into it. If it still turns, we cut hinges and I frag the threshold.”

*Agent reasoning: The dump is running and the door is trying to torque; I need to hold the line, buy 60 seconds, and be ready to burn the cartridge and breach if the seal fails.*

### Turn 151 [GAME]

You slam your shoulder into the cabinet frame, bracing it against the recorder’s vibration. The shock cage steadies a fraction—enough that the strobing LED stops jittering and locks into a clean, rapid flash.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** you reach for a chem-cool pack—then come up with empty fingers. Your kit doesn’t have one. Not in this loadout. What you *do* have is the Helix emergency sealant foam canister riding your rig and the foil-lined evidence pouch strip you’ve been using like a field sleeve.

The buffer cartridge continues to climb in heat; you can feel it radiating through the cabinet lip like a small engine. The service strip scrolls: **PRIORITY EXTRACT — 00:41… 00:40…** and the speaker coughs another smear of your call-signs, followed by something else—an overlay tone that *isn’t* human speech but rides it like harmony.

You snap your rifle up toward the bay door. Juno nods once, jaw clenched, and shifts her stance to keep the pump lever moving while she sights in on the already-dented wheel hub. “Copy,” she says. “Two more if it twitches. If it turns… I’m not waiting for you to say ‘mark.’”

On the door, the tapping returns—faster now, more confident. The hub gives a **half-millimeter quiver** (not a turn, but the beginning of one), and the gasket groans as pressure pulses against it from the other side, like someone timing their pushes to your seal cycles.

Above-left, the shot-buckled vent grille shivers again. A faint, sweet smell slips through the seam—wrongly *fresh*—and the metal around the duct seam beads with condensation, as if cold air is being pulled through from inside the ship.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** Forward wall cabinet at your chest, rifle shouldered downrange; Juno is aft at the pressure panel, pumping one-handed, pistol trained on the wheel hub; the vent sits high above-left, vibrating in its frame.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Priority extract: 00:40 remaining  
- Buffer cartridge: overheating risk rising  
- Bay door: pressure pulsing, hub quivering

### Turn 152 [PLAYER]

I wrap the foil-lined evidence strip around the buffer cartridge housing as a heat sink and slap it tight, then blast Helix foam into the vent grille seam until it seals and stops shivering. “Forty seconds—nothing gets in.”  

I swing the rifle back to the bay door, stance wide. “Juno, keep pumping. If that hub twitches again, light it up—if it starts turning, I’m cutting hinges and dumping a frag through the gap.”

*Agent reasoning: No cold pack—improvise cooling and deny the vent a way in while we ride out the 40 seconds. Force beats finesse: foam the vent seam, then keep the door covered and let Juno handle hub shots.*

### Turn 153 [GAME]

You cinch the foil-lined evidence strip around the buffer cartridge housing, forcing it tight against the cradle’s metal. **IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the heat has somewhere to go—your glove stops feeling like it’s over a burner, and the cartridge’s angry shimmer dulls to a manageable radiance. The recorder strobe stays stable instead of glitching.

You pivot and bury the Helix foam nozzle into the vent grille seam. The can hisses; expanding sealant mushrooms into the gap, then hardens in seconds into a glossy, pale plug. The shivering dies. The faint sweet smell is cut off mid-breath, like someone slammed a door on it.

SENSORY GROUNDING: You’re planted forward-right in the service bay, cabinet at your shoulder, rifle leveled aft at the pressure door; the foamed vent sits high above-left, now a white, frozen scar along the seam.

Behind the bay door, the pressure pulses shift again—less “knocking,” more like a body leaning and listening. The wheel hub gives a tiny twitch.

Juno doesn’t wait. Two shots, controlled, close together. The hub deforms further; a crescent of metal shears off and skitters across the deck, ringing. “That’s all the hub has,” she says, voice low. “If it moves now, it’s not using the wheel.”

The recorder speaker spits a cleaner slice of audio through the packet noise—your unit’s callsigns, timestamped wrong, followed by a Helix technician’s calm voice: “…bypass accepted—keep them talking. Latch the—” Static eats the rest, but the harmony-tone rides under it like a second throat.

The service strip scrolls: **PRIORITY EXTRACT — 00:19… 00:18…** Then: **PACKET LOSS: 3% — COMPENSATING**. The cartridge housing under your foil wrap ticks as it sheds heat into the cabinet frame.

At the door seam, a *new* sound: not torque—**a thin, wet drag** along the gasket line, slow, as if something is tracing where the seal is weakest.

STATUS UPDATES:
- Vent seam: foamed, sealed
- Buffer heat: stabilized (reduced)

### Turn 154 [PLAYER]

I snap, “Eighteen seconds—don’t you dare slip,” and stride to the door, blasting a hard line of Helix foam along the gasket seam where it’s dragging.  

I yank a frag, thumb the safety but keep the spoon pinned, and plant myself off to the side of the threshold. “Juno—keep pumping. If that seal drops or you hear metal tear, yell and get behind the cabinet. I’m sending this through the first crack I see.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re close to the dump finishing; I need to keep the door from being breached and be ready to move the moment the cartridge is done. The wet drag suggests it’s probing the seal—so I’ll reinforce the seam with foam and prep a frag/cut plan without wasting time talking.*

### Turn 155 [GAME]

You close the distance to the pressure door in three quick steps, foam canister up, and lay a thick bead right along the gasket line where the wet drag was tracing.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the foam bites into the seam and swells, filling microgaps. The dragging sound stutters—like whatever’s on the other side just met glue—and then stops. For half a second the bay goes almost quiet except for Juno’s pump strokes and the recorder’s strobing whine.

You pull a frag and thumb the safety down, spoon pinned hard under your palm, and sidestep off-axis from the threshold so you’re not standing in the door’s mouth.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re tight to the starboard side of the SPINE-2 service door, shoulder near the frame, rifle slung low, frag in hand; the foamed seam is a pale ridge at knee height that’s already skinning over.

Juno keeps pumping one-handed, pistol still trained on the ruined hub. “Copy—cabinet if it screams,” she says. Then, quieter: “Rhea… this isn’t pressure anymore. It’s *testing*.”

The service strip on the recorder cabinet behind you scrolls: **PRIORITY EXTRACT — 00:07… 00:06…** The buffer housing ticks under your foil wrap, dumping heat into the frame.

On the other side of the door, something changes tactics. No more pushing. You hear a soft, intimate sound through the metal—like fingertips on a drumhead—then a single, heavy impact from deeper in the corridor beyond, followed by a distant answering thud, as if something moved to line up with the door from farther back.

The foamed gasket bulges once, not from a leak—more like the seal being *sucked* at, trying to peel the foam from the metal. The foam holds, but it leaves a faint, stringy stretch mark where it’s under tension.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Door gasket: foamed, resisting peel  
- Frag: armed (spoon pinned)  
- Priority extract: 00:06 remaining

“Get behind the cabinet, now—keep pumping from cover!” I press my shoulder and boot into the doorframe to brace it, frag cocked and ready. “You make a crack, I feed you this—try me.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re seconds from the dump; I need to hold the seal and be ready to kill whatever tries a breach. The “line up” thuds mean a charge or tool—so I’ll brace for impact, get Juno behind cover, and prep to frag the moment a crack opens while I fall back to protect the recorder.*

### Turn 157 [GAME]

Juno snaps back behind the recorder cabinet, shoulder-checking it into a firmer brace, and drags the pump lever with both hands from cover. **IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the pressure panel’s needle steadies instead of dipping—she can keep the cycle going without exposing herself to the door line.

You wedge yourself into the frame: boot against the lower lip, shoulder into the jamb, frag in your fist with the spoon pinned so hard your knuckles whiten. The foamed gasket creaks under a new kind of force—not a push, a *peel*—like something on the far side is trying to lift the seal away in a single continuous strip.

SENSORY GROUNDING: Starboard side of the SPINE-2 service door, your shoulder grinding into cold alloy; the foam bead at shin height stretches into thin, sticky filaments.

The recorder cabinet behind you chirps as the extract hits its last breath. **PRIORITY EXTRACT — 00:01… 00:00.** The strobe goes solid for a beat—then the whole unit emits a harsh confirmation tone: **EXTRACT COMPLETE — BUFFER FLUSH PENDING.** The buffer cartridge under your foil wrap gives a sharp *tick* like a cooling engine, then settles.

On the other side of the door, the “fingertips” return—faster, more insistent—then stop dead. A low vibration rolls through the frame into your shoulder, not loud but *deep*, and the foamed seam dimples inward as if a vacuum mouth latched onto it.

Juno, breathing hard behind the cabinet, calls out without looking up: “We got it. Whatever it is—Rhea, it’s learning the seal cycles. It’s syncing to my pump rhythm.”

Then the doorframe gives a sudden, ugly **metallic chirp**—not a tear, a *shear*—from the hinge side, higher than your foam line. A hairline gap opens at eye level for the width of a fingernail, and something cold exhales through it: a thin, dry stream that smells like old filters and that same faint sweetness you foamed off earlier.

Your frag hand stays steady; the first crack is here.

### Turn 158 [PLAYER]

I jam the frag up to the hairline gap and shove it through, then rip my hand back and let the spoon fly. “DOWN!”  

I dive behind the recorder cabinet with Juno, rifle coming up as I hit the deck. “Stop pumping—seal it and hold, then we move. If it’s still there after the bang, we burn the door.”

*Agent reasoning: There’s a crack—if I hesitate it’ll widen and whatever’s syncing to the pump gets in. I’m armed and positioned off-axis, so I’ll frag the gap and then fall back to cover with Juno while the blast does the talking.*

### Turn 159 [GAME]

You drive the frag’s nose into the hinge-side hairline and shove until the casing scrapes metal—then it *catches* on something just beyond the gap and pops through. You rip your hand back and let the spoon go.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the grenade disappears into the corridor beyond the door. A half-second later the bay fills with the hard, flat sound of detonation—muffled by the bulkhead but violent enough to punch a pressure wave through the seam. The foamed gasket shudders; dust puffs from the doorframe. Something on the far side answers with a wet, aborted *thump*, like a body hitting a wall and sliding down.

You shout “DOWN!” and both you and Juno drop behind the recorder cabinet. You hit the deck hard, rifle snapping up as you settle into a low, braced posture.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re prone behind the cabinet on the bay’s port side, cheek near the cold deck; the cabinet’s strobe reflection jitters across your rifle barrel like a heartbeat.

Juno’s already moving—she slaps the pump valve closed with a gloved palm and drags the lever into a locked position. “Stopping. Holding pressure,” she says, then winces as another *ping* runs through the hinge line. “That blast didn’t open it—if anything it flexed the frame. But whatever was peeling? It’s not peeling now.”

Through the door, the probing “fingertips” are gone. In their place: a faint, irregular rasp—like something trying to breathe through damaged filters. The sweetness is back, thin but unmistakable, seeping through microfractures above your foam line.

The recorder cabinet chirps again: **BUFFER FLUSH PENDING**. The warm cartridge under your foil wrap ticks once more, then goes quiet—stable, but still live in your evidence pouch if you move it wrong.

Juno leans close, voice tight. “Rhea—Helix seals are layered. If we burn the door, we’ll cook the gasket and dump whatever’s in that corridor straight into our air. We need masks or we vent.”

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Frag: detonated beyond door  
- Door: still shut, frame stressed

### Turn 160 [PLAYER]

“Fine—no fire. Masks on, now.” I slap my respirator on and toss Juno hers, then jam more Helix foam into the microfractures above the seam. “Keep pressure locked—if that rasp gets closer, I’m cutting us a new exit. Where’s the nearest vent-to-space dump or secondary hatch in this bay?”

*Agent reasoning: The sweetness leak means contamination risk; burning the door is dumb without masks. I need to keep pressure, block leaks, and find another way out fast—either vent this compartment or cut an alternate route while whatever’s out there is stunned.*

### Turn 161 [GAME]

You and Juno get masks on fast—rubber seals biting your cheeks, filters clicking into place. You lob her respirator; she catches it against her chest, straps it on with shaking hands, and gives you a sharp nod from behind the visor.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** you drive fresh Helix sealant foam into the microfractures above the hinge-side seam. It blooms and skins over, and the thin sweet leak drops to almost nothing. The rasp on the far side dulls, like it’s suddenly breathing through a pillow.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** prone-to-kneeling behind the recorder cabinet, you lean out just enough to reach the upper crack; the foam smells chemically clean over the ship’s old ozone and burnt lube.

Behind you, the service bay’s overhead grilles tick with contraction, and the recorder cabinet keeps blinking **BUFFER FLUSH PENDING** like it wants attention you can’t spare. The tightbeam module you ripped free earlier sits dead-weight in your kit—no signal, but it’s a reminder: someone outside is likely listening for any sign you’re alive.

Juno keeps the pressure lever locked down with her forearm while she points with two fingers, quick and precise. “Nearest hard dump? Not in the bay. The vent-to-space purge valves are in the **SPINE-2 Recorder Service corridor**—about ten meters back the way we came. There’s a yellow manual pull plate on the bulkhead marked *ATM PURGE*. If it still has charge, it’ll dump this section to vacuum.”

Her finger shifts. “Secondary hatch—yes. See that maintenance panel you tore off? Behind that forward bulkhead is the **service chase (forward)**. It’ll snake you to the main corridor, maybe the spine trunk if the baffles aren’t jammed. It’s tight, but it’s ours.”

On the other side of the door, something scrapes—slow, cautious—then stops, as if it felt the foam set. A faint tap answers from farther away in the corridor beyond, not at the door itself. Whatever you fragged didn’t end the problem; it changed its distance.

Juno’s voice drops. “If we purge to space, we lose time and heat. If we go chase, we keep air—but we crawl.”

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Masks: on, filters engaged  
- Microfractures: foamed, sealed (temp)  
- Door threat: withdrawn a few meters

### Turn 162 [PLAYER]

“Service chase. Now.” I keep my rifle on the door while I rip the forward maintenance panel the rest of the way off, then shove in first. “Juno—stay on my heels. If you hear that tapping shift behind us, tell me and I’m sealing the hatch with foam.”

*Agent reasoning: Purging to space risks losing our footing and time; the thing’s backing off, so we take the tight route before it regroups. I want distance and a new angle, not a siege at this door.*

### Turn 163 [GAME]

You keep the rifle trained on the sealed pressure door while your off-hand worries the forward maintenance panel free. The last fasteners give with a sharp *snap* and the panel peels away, exposing a rectangular throat into the service chase—dark, close, webbed with bundled lines and old insulation.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** you get the panel fully off and get your shoulders into the chase. It’s passable, but tight enough that your rifle has to go in angled across your chest; the sling scrapes against conduit clamps. Juno slides in behind you, one hand on your boot for spacing, the other keeping her weight low so she doesn’t clang the ducting.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re belly-down in the **service chase (forward)**, moving away from the recorder bay; the metal is cold through your suit and smells of dust-baked polymer and stale coolant.

Behind you, the bay is now a muffled box of sound. The sealed door is out of sight, but you still feel it through vibrations in the chase framing. The tapping you’d heard earlier doesn’t return at the door—instead it shifts to a slower, more distant cadence that travels along the bulkhead like someone drumming on ribs, testing where you went.

Juno’s voice comes through her respirator, thin and controlled: “I hear it—*not* at the door. It’s tracking the structure. Rhea… it’s learning the chase routes.”

A second thread cuts in: your tightbeam module, buried in your kit, gives a tiny, involuntary **click**—not a full power-up, more like a capacitive twitch. No signal lights, but it’s the first “life” it’s shown since you ripped it free, like something nearby just changed the noise floor.

Up ahead, your headlamp catches a junction where the chase splits around a boxy unit stamped with faded Helix microtext. One of the conduit bundles is freshly disturbed—zip ties cut and re-tied recently, edges still bright against the grime. Someone has been in here since the ship went dark.

Juno hisses, urgent: “If you’re sealing behind us, do it *now*—I can’t hold the foam can and crawl at the same time.”

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Location: Service chase (forward)
- Recorder bay: line-of-sight lost

### Turn 164 [PLAYER]

I twist around as far as the chase allows and blast Helix foam into the maintenance opening behind Juno—gasket it thick, corners first, then a full bead across. “That buys us seconds, not safety. Move.”

I shove forward toward the junction, headlamp on the freshly re-tied zip ties. “Juno—eyes on that conduit work. You see a trip line or a charge, you tell me before you touch it.”

*Agent reasoning: That thing is tracking us through the structure—if we don’t block the chase now, it’ll follow. I’ll foam-seal the access behind us, then push forward toward the disturbed conduit because someone’s been here and that’s either an exit or a trap.*

### Turn 165 [GAME]

You torque in the cramped chase until your shoulder grinds a conduit clamp and you can just get the foam nozzle past Juno’s hip. You lay it in like you meant it—corners first, then a thick bead across the maintenance opening’s rim.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the foam swells and skins into a crude gasket, bridging metal to metal. It won’t hold against real pressure, but it *will* slow anything trying to probe or push through the same way you did. As it cures, the chase carries a muted *thud* from behind—something testing the now-foamed opening. The foam doesn’t blow out. Not yet.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** belly-down in the forward service chase, you push toward the junction; your headlamp throws a hard cone over dusty lines and that too-clean, recently handled conduit bundle.

The tapping changes again—less like random drumming, more like deliberate knocks that “walk” along the bulkhead toward your new seal, then pause as if listening for your movement. At the same time, your kit gives that tiny tightbeam *click* again—closer to a heartbeat now, not a full activation, but an electrical twitch that coincides with the knocks.

At the junction, the freshly re-tied zip ties aren’t just neat—they’re **wrong**: Helix-standard black ties, but cinched with a left-handed twist pattern you remember from field harnessing. Marine habit. Somebody with training.

Juno crawls up alongside enough to get her visor close. She doesn’t touch anything—just angles her lamp and uses two fingers to hover over the bundle. “No trip filament that I can see. No obvious charge pack. But—look.” She points to a thin, flattened puck of adhesive-backed material tucked under the conduit wrap, almost invisible until the light hits it: a **contact sensor**—the kind used to tell if a panel’s been opened or a line’s been disturbed. “Helix audit tamper tell. If we yank this bundle, it’ll log it… if anything’s still listening.”

Behind you, the foam seal gives a soft *creak* as it finishes curing. Another *thud* answers—closer this time, heavier, like a forearm braced against the bulkhead rather than fingertips.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Maintenance opening: foamed/sealed (temporary)  
- Pursuer: testing seal, closing

### Turn 166 [PLAYER]

“Then we kill the snitch.” I jam my knife under the edge of the contact sensor and peel it off in one hard yank, crush it in my fist, then shove the conduit bundle aside with my forearm to clear the junction. “Juno—move, now. If that foam seal pops, I’m not playing nice.”

*Agent reasoning: The thing’s closing and the tamper sensor could alert whoever’s behind this; I’ll rip it out fast and push through before we get boxed in.*

### Turn 167 [GAME]

You get the knife tip under the sensor’s edge and rip. The adhesive fights, then lets go with a wet, tearing sound. You crush the puck in your fist until its casing crinkles and the thin internal film snaps.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the “snitch” dies—but not quietly. A pinprick LED inside it flashes once as it breaks, and your tightbeam module answers with a sharp, involuntary *tick-tick* like it just heard a handshake. For half a second, your comm band fills with a thin, almost-human tone riding the static—then it’s gone, leaving the air in your helmet feeling suddenly too loud.

You shoulder the conduit bundle aside. It shifts—stiffer than it should—and a hidden clamp bites your forearm through the suit fabric. Not a cut, but a hard pinch that leaves your arm tingling. The junction beyond opens just enough to see the chase continuing around that Helix-stamped box, and a narrower drop-slot leading down into darker space.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** still in the forward service chase at the junction, headlamp glare bouncing off fresh black zip ties and dusty insulation.

Juno moves when you say move—fast, controlled crawl, boots scraping metal. She looks back once, eyes wide behind the visor. “That sensor wasn’t just logging. It was *powered.* Something’s alive on this spine, Rhea—local. Not shipwide, but… awake.”

Behind you, the foam-sealed maintenance opening gives a long, ugly **crack**—not fully failed, but stressed. A weight leans into it from the far side, and the foam emits a faint chemical squeal as it compresses. The tapping stops. Replaced by pressure.

Juno’s voice drops to a whisper that still carries urgency. “If it breaches, it’ll come through hands-first. Keep your muzzle down the chase—no room to swing.”

### Turn 168 [PLAYER]

“Down the slot—go!” I shove Juno toward the drop-slot, then plant myself at the junction with my rifle braced down the chase at the foamed opening. “If anything punches through, I’m dumping a mag—don’t stop moving.”

*Agent reasoning: The seal’s about to fail and the chase is too tight for finesse; I need distance and a kill lane. The drop-slot might buy space, and I can cover the breach while Juno moves.*

### Turn 169 [GAME]

You shove Juno hard toward the drop-slot. She catches the lip with both hands, swings her boots under, and disappears down with a controlled slide, her lamp beam knifing into the dark below. “I’m down—keep it tight!” her voice snaps back up the chase.

You plant at the junction, rifle braced, cheek welded to stock as much as the cramped crawl allows. Muzzle aimed straight at the foamed maintenance opening behind you.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the foam seal fails in stages. First a bulge, then a tearing *pop* as the bead separates from one corner. Something presses through—pale pressure against amber light—then fingers. Not gloved. Too long at the joints, nails dark with grease or dried blood. It doesn’t lunge; it **feels**, spreading the breach wider with patient force.

You dump rounds the instant you get a clear line. In the confined chase the shots are deafening even through your respirator filters; muzzle flash strobes the conduits. The first impacts chew foam and metal. One round hits whatever’s behind the hand—there’s a dull, wet thunk, and the fingers spasm, trying to hold on anyway.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re still at the forward chase junction—drop-slot at your left, foamed opening behind down the straight run; your headlamp beam shakes with recoil, turning dust into glittering snow.

**MULTIPLE THREADS MOVING:** Juno is dropping fast below, her bootfalls clanging down the slot ladder rungs. Your tightbeam module in your kit starts ticking in time with the recoil like it’s being “woken” by the gunfire’s vibration. And the thing at the breach—after the hit—changes tactic: the hand withdraws, then something heavier leans in, testing the opening’s edges as if it’s about to **widen** it rather than come through.

Juno’s voice, distant now: “There’s a junction down here—two ways—Rhea, I’ve got—” Her transmission warps, swallowed by a thin, singing overtone that rides the static for a heartbeat before clearing. “—I’ve got a door wheel! Hurry!”

The breach makes a new sound: not tapping—**scraping metal**, like a tool or bone dragging along the frame to pry.

### Turn 170 [PLAYER]

I fire one more short burst to keep its head down, then yank a spare magazine free and hurl it hard at the breach as a distraction. “Juno—spin that wheel and don’t wait for me!” I sling the rifle tight and drop into the slot after her, boots-first, moving as fast as I can without snapping an ankle.

*Agent reasoning: Holding here will get me pinned in a tube; I’ve already slowed it and Juno found a wheel-door. I’ll toss something nasty to buy seconds, then drop after her fast.*

### Turn 171 [GAME]

Your last burst hammers the frame and whatever’s behind it—enough to make the probing stop for a breath. You rip a spare mag and sling it like a rock.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the magazine smacks the breach with a loud, metallic *clang* and ricochets into the foam debris. The thing reacts—fast. A hand shoots through and snatches at it, fingers hooking the baseplate. That buys you the half-second you need: the scraping shifts from “pry the opening” to “grab the new object.”

You sling the rifle tight and drop boots-first into the slot.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** the drop-slot is a narrow vertical throat; cold metal rungs bite your soles as you slide, your lamp beam strobing over greasy ladder rails and a smear of fresh handprint on the inside wall—still wet-looking, not old.

Below, Juno is already at a junction collar, braced at a **wheel-dogged pressure door** set into the trunk. She’s spinning it with both hands, shoulders shaking with effort. “It’s stiff—like it’s been heat-welded and *reopened*,” she grunts, then—more quietly—“Rhea, the paint’s scratched around the dogs. Someone’s been cycling this.”

Over your comm, the tightbeam module ticks again, then goes silent—like it just found a lock to listen through.

Above, the chase behind you erupts: foam tearing, metal popping. Not a full body forcing through—more like it’s widening the hole with leverage now that it has something to brace on. You hear a brief, wet inhale that doesn’t belong in a vacuumed derelict.

Juno gets the wheel to give another quarter turn. “Door’s almost free—when it opens, we’re in a service corridor. If Helix wired alarms down here, they’ll be *old*, but old doesn’t mean dead.”

### Turn 172 [PLAYER]

I grab the wheel with Juno and put my weight into it. “On three—rip it!” As soon as it breaks free, I shoulder through first with the rifle up, sweeping the service corridor for anything moving while Juno slips in behind me and we slam the door shut.

*Agent reasoning: Door is our only hard barrier; I’ll muscle it open and be ready to shoot anything that follows, no time for finesse.*

### Turn 173 [GAME]

You clamp both hands on the wheel with Juno, boots wedged against the collar. “One—two—three—”

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** it breaks loose with a metallic *crack* that vibrates up your arms. The last dog clears and the pressure door yawns inward a handspan on its own, like it’s been held shut under tension. You shoulder through first, rifle up.

Your lamp cuts into a **service corridor** running fore-aft. The air is colder here, drier—filters working somewhere—or something mimicking them. The deck is dusted with gray grit except for a single clean drag mark leading left, as if something heavy was pulled recently.

You sweep right: empty bulkheads, cable trays, a dead junction box with its faceplate missing. Sweep left: a recessed alcove with a Helix maintenance stencil and a **sealed utility locker**—its latch is scuffed bright, used. No movement, but you catch a faint, rhythmic *click… click… click* from deeper down the corridor, not quite mechanical, not quite organic.

Juno slips in behind you, breath ragged. “Door—now!” She throws her shoulder into it with you.

The door slams shut. You spin the wheel half a turn back—enough to catch the dogs but not fully lock—when something hits from the other side: not a full-body ram, more like hands and forearms scrabbling for purchase. The metal booms once, then again—testing. The seam exhales a thin thread of foam dust.

Over comms, a Helix-clean voice bleeds in for a second—tightbeam leakage, not your channel: “…audit team holding at—” then it garbles into that same thin singing overtone before snapping back to dead static.

Juno presses close, eyes on the corridor. “That wasn’t Helix chatter. That was a *recording*—or something wearing one.”

### Turn 174 [PLAYER]

I crank the wheel the rest of the way, dogging the door tight. “There. Let it break its fingers.”

I pivot left, rifle up, and advance along the drag mark toward the alcove. “Juno—cover our six and that door. If it starts cutting through, yell.” Then I grab the utility locker latch and try to wrench it open.

*Agent reasoning: That thing’s right on the other side—lock the door fully, then push toward the fresh drag mark and hit the used locker fast before it can flank us.*

### Turn 175 [GAME]

You crank the wheel the rest of the way. The dogs bite home one by one with a deep, satisfying *thunk-thunk-thunk* until the door’s seam sits flush. On the other side, the scrabbling turns into a frustrated, muffled thud—then a long, slow drag down the metal, like nails being pulled away.

You pivot left and follow the drag mark toward the recessed alcove, rifle leading. The lower service corridor is tight and rectangular; your lamp glazes the walls in a thin sheen of condensation that shouldn’t be here. The drag trail is clean-edged, recent—something heavy, soft-bodied, and not dragged by machinery.

Behind you, Juno plants herself near the wheel, weapon up, breathing controlled now. “Copy. I hear it moving—*not* leaving. Like it’s… repositioning.”

At the alcove, the Helix stencil is old but crisp: **UTIL—AUX / FILTER & PATCH**. The locker latch is scuffed bright, and when you wrench it, it doesn’t resist like a sealed unit—someone’s already compromised it. It pops with a sharp *clack* and the door swings open a handspan.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** you get it open—then a thin, bitter chemical smell rolls out, and your lamp catches a coil of filament netting inside, the same tacky texture as your fist-sized fragment. It’s looped around something else: a compact hardcase with a Helix microstamp and a fresh smear of reddish-brown on the corner.

As you pull the locker wider, the corridor’s faint *click… click… click* deepens for a moment, syncing with your movements like a nervous tell. Juno’s voice tightens. “Rhea—door’s quiet. Too quiet. I don’t like it when it learns.”

Far down the corridor, your light picks up a second drag mark intersecting yours—newer—leading into a darker side recess you hadn’t clocked at first. The air there tastes faintly sweet under the respirator filters.

### Turn 176 [PLAYER]

I yank the hardcase out and snap it open right there, rifle still angled downrange. “Juno—if that door moves, you light it up.”  

I grab the filament net coil too, sling it over my shoulder, then advance toward the newer drag mark and the dark side recess. “Whatever’s in there, we’re not letting it set the terms—move.”

*Agent reasoning: Something’s stalking us and that locker has Helix gear and blood—possible answers and tools. I’ll arm up fast, then push toward the side recess before it comes to us.*

### Turn 177 [GAME]

You yank the microstamped hardcase free and snap it open one-handed, rifle still holding the corridor.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the latches give too easily—like they were meant to be opened in a hurry. Inside: a foam cradle holding a **slim data wafer sleeve** (Helix Quiet Desk format), a **thumb-sized chem-light bundle** (old stock, still sealed), and a **folded strip of pressure-sensitive patch tape** stamped with a quarantine sigil you’ve only seen on black-site doors. No weapon. No medkit. This is a courier cache.

As the case opens, your ripped-tightbeam module on your kit ticks once—like it recognized the wafer’s shielding—then goes dead quiet again.

You hook the filament net coil out of the locker and sling it. It clings to your glove for a beat before letting go, tacky like it wants contact. The added weight shifts your shoulder; it’s more coil than you thought—enough to foul a doorway if you have to.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re in the lower service corridor’s utility alcove, left-hand wall; the newer drag mark cuts forward into a darker side recess ahead. The air there carries that faint sweetness under your respirator filters.

Juno stays at the dog wheel, muzzle trained on the sealed door. “If it moves, I burn it,” she says, then adds low, urgent: “Rhea—listen. It stopped *trying* the door the second you opened that case. Like it got what it wanted confirmed.”

You advance toward the newer drag mark and the side recess. The corridor lighting dies another notch as you pass a dead strip; your lamp becomes the only honest light. The drag mark into the recess is fresher, wetter—ending at a shadowed lip where the deck plating is slightly bowed, as if something was shoved under or through.

Behind you, the dogged door booms once—harder than before—followed by a soft, deliberate *tap… tap… tap* right where the latch mechanism would be. Not force. Testing. Learning the geometry.

### Turn 178 [PLAYER]

“Juno—don’t waste ammo. If that latch starts to turn, scream.”

I sprint back, slap the filament net coil across the door seam and wheel housing, then mash the quarantine patch tape over it like a splint. “Now it’s got something to chew.”  

I crack a chem-light and toss it into the dark side recess, then move in behind the glow with my rifle up. “Show yourself—now.”

*Agent reasoning: The tapping means it’s figuring the latch—if we let it, it’ll get through. I’ll force the initiative: trap the door with the filament net and patch tape, then hit the recess fast and loud to see what’s hiding.*

### Turn 179 [GAME]

You don’t give Juno a chance to argue. She nods once, jaw tight, and keeps her muzzle low. “If that wheel twitches, you’ll hear me.”

You sprint back to the pressure door and slap the **filament net** across the seam and wheel housing. It adheres instantly—tacky strands biting into the metal like wet cobweb. When you mash the **quarantine patch tape** over it, the tape bonds with a faint heat-hiss, the sigil going dull as if it’s drinking static. The net stiffens into a crude brace.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the tapping on the far side changes pitch—higher, faster—then stops. Not defeated. Occupied. Something begins worrying the net from the other side, a soft rasping that vibrates through the wheel spokes.

You crack a chem-light; the snap is loud in the corridor. Green bleeds into your glove. You toss it into the dark side recess—its arc is short, clipped by the bowed deck lip—then it skitters and comes to rest half-visible, painting the recess in sickly light.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re back at the lower service corridor’s side recess, just left of the dogged door; the chem-light glow crawls under a slightly lifted deck plate like a slit of underwater light.

In that glow, you see why the plate is bowed: **someone pried it up from below**. The drag mark ends at a smear of wet gray and a scatter of tiny black flecks—like burnt gasket material.

A shape moves under the plate. Not a body. A **bundle of cable-thin tendrils**—filamentous, jointless—slides toward the green light, testing it. When you bark “Show yourself—now,” the tendrils pause, then withdraw with uncanny restraint, as if the voice is data it needs to parse.

Juno’s voice carries from the door, tight and controlled. “Rhea—wheel’s steady. But the net… it’s *vibrating*. Like it’s being plucked.”

From deeper in the service corridor, the earlier *click… click… click* returns—closer now—and it’s accompanied by a faint, distorted whisper on dead comms that isn’t on any channel: a fragment of your old unit cadence, wrong tempo, like a mouth learning to march.

### Turn 180 [PLAYER]

“Juno—get off that door and get eyes down the corridor. If the net pops, you run and you yell.”

I drop to a knee at the bowed plate, jam my rifle muzzle at the gap, and fire a short burst into the space under the decking. Then I hook my fingers under the lifted edge and yank hard, trying to peel the plate up enough to expose whatever’s hiding.

*Agent reasoning: Two threats and I’m not letting either dictate pace. The thing under the deck gets flushed or pinned fast; the door gets a human alarm and a kill plan without wasting ammo.*

### Turn 181 [GAME]

Juno peels off the door immediately, boots sticking as she backpedals to get a longer sightline down the lower service corridor. She keeps her rifle up, scanning past you. “Copy. If it pops, I’m moving and I’m loud.”

You drop to a knee at the bowed plate, ram your muzzle into the gap, and fire a short burst.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the rounds don’t “thud” into something solid—most of them **spark and ricochet** off structural ribs under the deck. One round finds something softer: there’s a wet *snap* and a thin spray of gray fluid spits back out, misting your glove and the edge of the plate. The tendril-bundle under there jerks away fast—too fast for anything with bones.

The recoil and muzzle blast in the confined gap kick up a stinging haze of insulation dust and sweet chemical stink that your respirator filters struggle to swallow. The chem-light’s green glow stutters as it rolls, then steadies again, painting the underside with trembling shadows.

You hook your fingers under the lifted edge and yank hard. The plate rises—**but not cleanly**. Whatever pried it from below has **warped the fasteners**; you get it up a few more centimeters before something underneath **pulls back**, like a cable winching. The metal bites into your knuckles.

Behind you, the filament net on the pressure door **twangs**—a sharp plucked vibration that travels down the wheel spokes. Juno snaps her head toward it. “Rhea—net’s under load. Something’s testing the brace with rhythm, not force.”

Under the plate, the tendrils reappear for a half-second in the chem-light: not just filaments—there’s a **knot of pale, translucent tissue** where they meet, pulsing like a throat. It makes a faint, involuntary sound that leaks into your comms as a distorted syllable—*almost* your call-sign cadence, mangled.

Then it spits something up into the gap: a **small black puck shard**—but this one is warm and **faintly vibrating**—and the tendrils withdraw again, dragging the shard’s twin clattering deeper under the deck.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re kneeling at the dark side recess off the lower service corridor; the dogged pressure door with the net-brace is behind and right, Juno farther down the corridor watching both angles.

### Turn 182 [PLAYER]

“Juno—shoot anything that moves in the hall. If the door pops, fall back to me.”

I grab the warm puck shard, whip it into the gap under the plate like bait, then stomp the deck edge for leverage and yank the plate up hard. If it gives, I jam the filament net coil down into the opening and try to snag and drag the tendril-knot out into the light.

*Agent reasoning: It’s hiding under the deck and the door brace is being “played” like it’s probing us; I’m not letting it dictate tempo. I’ll force the plate up fast and use the net as a trap, while Juno watches the corridor for anything else.*

### Turn 184 [PLAYER]

“Juno—shoot anything that moves in the hall. If that door pops, fall back to me.”

I fling the warm puck shard into the gap, stomp the deck edge for leverage, and rip the plate up hard. The moment it gives, I shove the filament net into the opening and hook it around the tendril-knot, yanking like I’m hauling cable—drag it into the light.

*Agent reasoning: It’s hiding under the deck and the door thing is still a threat; I’m forcing the plate open and using the net to pin and haul the tendril-knot into the open before it can retreat.*

“Juno—shoot anything that moves in the hall. If that door pops, fall back to me.”

I fling the warm puck shard into the gap as bait, stomp the deck edge for leverage, and rip the plate up hard. The moment it gives, I ram the filament net down into the opening and hook it around that tendril-knot, yanking like I’m hauling cable—drag it into the light.

*Agent reasoning: I’m done playing nice—if it’s under the deck, I’m dragging it out. I need Juno watching the hall while I force the plate and snare the thing with the net.*

### Turn 188 [PLAYER]

“Juno—eyes down the hall. If that door so much as twitches, you yell and fall back to me.”

I stomp the deck lip for leverage and rip the bowed plate up hard, then jam the filament net coil into the gap and crank it like a hook—snag the tendril-knot and haul it out into the chem-light.

*Agent reasoning: There’s nothing new on-screen; I’m not waiting around. I’ll force the issue by tearing the plate open and flushing whatever’s under there into the open, while ordering Juno to cover the corridor and the braced door.*

### Turn 189 [GAME]

The bowed plate gives with a wet, reluctant snap—your pry and stomp peel it up just enough to expose a black seam beneath. You ram the tacky filament coil down into the gap and twist hard.

It *catches*.

Not like cable—like cartilage. The net cinches around the tendril-knot and you haul, shoulders burning, boots skidding on the slightly sticky deck. Something down there resists for a half-second… then yields all at once.

A fist-sized clump comes up into your chem-light: pale, corded strands braided around a puck-shard-like sliver that’s *not* metal—more like glassy bone. The whole knot shivers in your net, vibrating in sympathy with the warm shard you threw earlier, as if it recognized the frequency.

The gap below exhales cold, sweet air—wrongly perfumed—and the exposed edges of the under-duct *pulse* once, like a throat swallowing.

Down the hall to starboard, Juno’s silhouette stays locked on the pressure door line. “Door’s still shut,” she says, voice tight. Then, quieter: “Rhea… I’m getting a faint carrier in my helmet. Not comms. Like—like a lullaby under the static.” She shifts her stance anyway, rifle tracking the seam. “Something just tapped back. Three knocks. From the other side.”

Behind you, deeper in the service chase, the hull ticks out of rhythm for a few beats—then stops entirely, as if listening.

The tendril-knot in your net flexes again, trying to pull back toward the opening. A thin strand snaps and whips your glove, leaving a tacky smear that crawls a millimeter on its own before going still.

### Turn 190 [PLAYER]

I jam my boot down on the edge of the opening and stomp the tendril-knot hard against the deck, then put two quick rounds into the glassy sliver until it stops twitching. “Juno—kill the audio feed. Yank your helmet to local-only and stay off the static. Door knocks again, you light the seam.” Then I shove the netted clump into a seal bag and drag it with me as I move to cover the pressure door with my rifle.

*Agent reasoning: I’ve got a live sample trying to crawl back and something smart knocking on the door—no time for spooky music. I’m going to kill the knot, bag it, and reposition to cover the door before it pops.*

### Turn 191 [GAME]

Your boot comes down hard on the netted clump—there’s a *rubbery crunch* and a spray of cold, sweet-smelling vapor that fogs the deck for a second. The tendril-knot spasms, flattening under your sole like something trying to squirm out of its own skin.

You fire two quick rounds into the glassy sliver.

The first shot doesn’t *spark*—it *sings*. A thin, bell-like tone rings up through your rifle stock and into your teeth. The sliver fractures in a spiderweb pattern, and the tendrils seize as if electrocuted.

The second round finishes it: the “bone-glass” chips apart and the vibration dies… but the sound doesn’t fully leave. It lingers in the corridor as a faint aftertone, like a pressure change your ears can’t equalize.

Juno flinches at the first tone, then snaps to your order. “Copy—local-only.” You hear her fingers on her helmet controls; the constant hiss collapses into clean, close-breath silence. “Static’s gone. And—Rhea? The carrier was *riding* the dead channel. It wasn’t coming from the hall. It was coming from… everywhere the hull’s grounded.”

You shove the netted mass into a seal bag. The plastic fogs immediately from inside, and a thin tacky smear crawls along the bag’s inner wall before going still. It’s heavier than it should be—like it’s full of wet sand.

You drag it with you and settle into cover on the near side of the SPINE-2 / RECORDER SERVICE pressure door corridor, rifle leveled at the seam. Amber emergency strips pulse overhead; the light makes the door’s gasket look bruised.

From the other side of the door: nothing… then a soft, deliberate *scrape* along the seam, as if something is testing the seal with a fingernail.

Juno tightens on her angle down the hall, voice low. “If it knocks again, I’ll stitch the seam. But if it’s Helix… they’ll answer gunfire with breaching foam and a warrant.”

Behind you, the torn deck opening exhales again—smaller this time—like it’s learning to breathe quietly.

### Turn 192 [PLAYER]

“Juno—put your muzzle on that seam and don’t blink. If it breaches, you fire center-mass, no warnings.”

I kick the torn plate back over the deck opening and stomp it down, then slap a strip of seal-tape across the worst gap to buy seconds. I pull a flash charge, set it low on the door frame, and bark, “On my pop—if it’s Helix, they can scream at me after.” Then I pop the flash and slice the door seam with my rifle up, ready to dump rounds at the first non-human movement.

*Agent reasoning: Something’s probing the door and the deck opening is “breathing”—I’m not waiting to get pincered. I’ll force the initiative: hard seal the opening, then control the door with a flash/angle check and be ready to shoot if it’s not human.*

### Turn 194 [PLAYER]

“Juno—muzzle on the seam. If it breaches, you fire center-mass, no warnings.”

I kick the torn plate back over the deck opening and stomp it down, slap seal-tape across the worst gap, then plant a flash charge low on the door frame. “On my pop.” I detonate it and immediately rake the seam with my rifle barrel, trying to pry it open—ready to dump rounds the second something non-human shows.

*Agent reasoning: The door’s being tested and I’m done waiting—flash to steal initiative, then force entry and shoot anything that isn’t clearly Juno or human.*

### Turn 195 [GAME]

The flash charge pops low on the frame—white-out and a concussive *thump* that slaps your sinuses flat. The pressure door’s gasket spits dust and flakes of sealant; the seam blooms with a brief halo of ionized haze.

Immediate outcome: you don’t get a clean breach. The door holds dogged shut—but whatever was on the other side *jerks back hard*, and something wet drags across the seam as it retreats. Your rifle barrel rakes the gap and catches just enough purchase to lever a hairline opening—millimeters—before the auto-seal fights you and clamps again with a brutal, hydraulic *chatter*.

You’re still in the SPINE-2 / Recorder Service pressure-door corridor, back to the torn deck section you just re-covered. The tape you slapped down puckers as the deck beneath exhales once, faint and cold, like a held breath leaking.

Juno does exactly what you told her: muzzle welded to the seam, eyes wide and unblinking behind her visor. “Center-mass, copy.” Her voice is too steady—training over fear. “Rhea—flash hit something. I saw a silhouette through the seam haze. Not a suit. Too… jointed.”

From the other side of the door comes a new sound: not knocking—*fast, light impacts* skittering along the inner face, like fingertips running in a line. Then a pause. Then three deliberate knocks again, closer to the latch side this time, as if it learned where you’re aiming.

On your left, down the corridor toward the service chase, your bagged evidence clump fogs thicker; the plastic dimples inward for a second as if something inside flexed—then goes still. Your warm puck shard in your kit answers with a faint vibration, matching the rhythm of the knocks.

Over your comm—local-only, clean—Juno adds, “If Helix is stacked on the other side, they’ll have a breach cam up after that flash. If it’s not Helix… it just tested the seal twice in under ten seconds.”

**Status updates**

### Turn 196 [PLAYER]

“Juno, keep that seam pinned—if it shows a limb, you hose it.”

I yank a strip of breaching putty and mash it along the latch-side seam where it’s been knocking, then backpedal to cover and bark, “Flash on my mark—then we blow the latch.” I ready another flash in my off-hand and settle my rifle on the seam, eyes flicking once to the taped deck patch to make sure it’s not bulging.

*Agent reasoning: The door’s holding and whatever’s behind it is learning; I’m not waiting for it to choose the moment. I want the initiative—either force the breach on my terms or fall back and weld it shut.*

### Turn 197 [GAME]

You mash the breaching putty into the latch-side seam. It sticks immediately—too well—like the door frame is tacky under the paint. Your glove comes away with a thin string of adhesive that *doesn’t* snap clean, stretching and then recoiling onto the metal with a wet little flick.

**Immediate outcome:** the knocking stops the second the putty touches the latch side. For two heartbeats, there’s only the ship’s irregular tick and your own breathing. Then the seam *draws in* a fraction—like something on the far side just pulled vacuum on the crack. The putty dimples, trying to creep into the gap. Not detonating yet—just… being tasted.

You backpedal into cover, rifle braced on the edge of the bulkhead, flash in your off-hand. The corridor is tight here: pressure door dead ahead, service chase access down-left, and behind you the taped deck patch sits at a slight angle where you stomped it in. Amber strips pulse overhead, turning the putty’s surface glossy-black for a beat, then dull again.

Juno stays welded to the seam, muzzle steady. “Pinned.” Her voice drops. “Rhea—careful. That seam just *pulled* like there’s pressure differential. If we pop it and it’s not equalized, we’ll get a bite of atmosphere—and anything loose comes with it.”

As you flick your eyes to the deck patch, you catch it: the tape lifts a millimeter along one edge, not bulging up—*sinking*, as if the space under the plate just lost pressure. A faint, sweet-ozone breath threads out through the tape and curls along the deck toward the pressure door.

At the same time, your warm puck shard in your kit starts vibrating harder, syncing to a new pattern: not three knocks—now a rapid triplet, like a stuttered syllable. From beyond the door comes a soft, sliding scrape along the latch-side dog—right where you planted the putty—followed by a quiet *click* that isn’t the door opening… it’s something aligning.

Juno adds, almost whispering, “If Helix is there, they’re not announcing. And if it’s the other thing—flash might not blind it. It reacted to the tone last time.”

**Status updates**

### Turn 198 [PLAYER]

“Juno, hold that seam—if it moves, you dump the mag.”

I yank the breaching putty back off the latch-side seam (fast, rough), then slap my palm over the gap like a check for airflow. “We equalize first—find me an override or a vent, now.” I keep my rifle trained one-handed and kick the taped deck patch hard, reseating it, then stomp the edge again to stop that suction.

*Agent reasoning: Pressure’s wrong and something’s manipulating the latch; blowing now could suck us into a bad breach. I need to stabilize pressure, stop the “taste” on the putty, and be ready to kill whatever comes through—fast.*

### Turn 199 [GAME]

You rip the breaching putty off fast and rough.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** it comes away with a tearing *schlurp*—and a thin, translucent filament comes with it, stretching from the seam to your glove like pulled taffy. The moment it snaps, the latch-side seam *coughs* a cold puff straight into your palm. Not a steady leak—two quick pulses, like something on the far side tested the pressure with a mouthful of air and spat it back.

Your palm over the gap feels it: a faint in-out flutter, then stillness. The door doesn’t open, but the inner dog you heard earlier clicks again—closer, more certain—like whatever is inside just re-seated itself after you stole its “plug.”

You keep the rifle one-handed, muzzle pinned on the latch line. The corridor’s amber strips strobe over the glossy smear you left on the frame; the metal tastes of ozone through your respirator.

Behind you, you kick the taped deck patch hard. The plate grinds down with a metallic *clack* and your stomp seats it—but the suction doesn’t fully stop. Instead, the tape along the edge flutters once, then lies flat as if the pressure equalized for a second… and then a slow, creeping pull returns, gentler now, like a steady draw through a narrow throat below.

Juno doesn’t look away from the seam. “Holding.” Her rifle tracks a millimeter as the door face subtly *dimples* near the latch—barely visible, but wrong for rigid plating. “Override—there’s a manual dog socket on the frame, starboard side. But it’s on *their* side of the hinge line unless we get the service chase vent open.”

She snaps her head toward the service chase access down-left without moving her feet. “If we can pop the forward maintenance bulkhead vent—tie it into the chase—we can bleed pressure into the corridor and stop the door from biting us when it goes.”

While she talks, your warm puck shard vibrates hard enough to buzz against your gear. The sealed evidence bag fogs again, and for a heartbeat the tendril-knot inside presses against the plastic like a knuckle, then relaxes.

From the other side of the door: a soft, careful scrape along the latch channel—no more knocks—followed by a sound like someone exhaling through teeth.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Breaching putty: removed, contaminated  
- Door seam: pulsed airflow detected  
- Deck patch: reseated, slow draw persists

### Turn 200 [PLAYER]

“Juno—don’t move. If that seam flexes, you empty it.”

I wipe that filament off on the bulkhead like it’s poison and move hard to the service chase access. I plant my boot, smash the forward maintenance vent cover open, and start cranking it to bleed pressure into the corridor—rifle up between motions. “Call it—pressure change? And if you see a hand, break it.”

*Agent reasoning: The door’s being worked from the other side and the deck’s still drawing—pressure games. I’m not waiting for it to choose the timing; I’ll force equalization through the service chase and be ready to shoot anything that comes through.*

### Turn 201 [GAME]

You smear the filament on the bulkhead. It doesn’t wipe clean—just thins into a glossy streak that *crawls* a few millimeters back toward the pressure door before going still, like it remembers where it came from.

You lunge to the service chase access down-left—two strides from the pressure door corridor—boot planted, and you smash the forward maintenance vent cover. The grille gives with a sharp *crack* and a spit of brittle screws; stale air burps out, carrying that sweet-ozone note stronger, like warmed plastic and old blood.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** you get the vent open and start cranking the bleed wheel. The first quarter-turn fights you—then the mechanism catches and the corridor pressure shifts. Your ears pop under the respirator seal. The taped deck patch behind you stops “drinking” at once; the tape settles flat with a relieved little *slap*.

Juno doesn’t move. She’s a statue at the seam, rifle locked. “Pressure’s changing—yeah,” she says, voice clipped. “Seam flutter stopped. Good.” Then, quieter: “Rhea… something’s *moving inside the latch channel*. Not a hand. Too many joints.”

As the vent bleeds, the pressure door responds: the latch-side seam relaxes a hair and exhales a thin, steady stream now—controlled, not pulsed. The door face dimples again near the latch and you hear a soft internal ratchet, like someone carefully taking tension off a spring.

At the same time, down in the open vent throat, something taps back—three light impacts on the duct wall, answering the old knock pattern. The sound is *inside* the ship’s lungs now, not behind the door.

Juno’s muzzle dips a fraction, tracking. “If it shows—” She stops mid-sentence as a shape slides into the seam gap: not a hand, but a narrow, pale strip that looks like tendon under skin. It probes once, testing the edge where your putty was, then withdraws fast, leaving a wet sheen.

Your gear buzzes: the warm puck shard vibrates hard enough to rattle against the tightbeam module. The sealed evidence bag fogs, then clears in a single breath, like something just inhaled through plastic.

### Turn 202 [PLAYER]

“Juno—shoot the next probe. Don’t wait.”

I stop cranking and slam the vent wheel shut, then jam my combat knife into the duct throat to wedge it and block anything coming through. I pivot back to the door, plant my shoulder on the latch side, and fire a short burst right where that tendon-strip appeared—then shout, “Now we breach—on my push!” and start forcing the seam with brute weight.

*Agent reasoning: The thing’s probing the seam and now it’s in the vents too—talking won’t help. I need to deny it access and force the door on my terms, fast.*

### Turn 203 [GAME]

You slam the vent wheel shut. The bleed stops with a sharp *thunk* that you feel through the bulkhead, and the corridor pressure rebounds—your respirator seal creaks as your ears try to catch up.

You drive your combat knife into the duct throat to wedge it. **IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the blade bites into something softer than sheet metal—there’s a wet resistance, like puncturing a thick membrane. The duct answers with a tight, strangled *chitter* from deeper inside, and the knife hilt trembles as whatever’s in there pulls away. A thin ribbon of translucent slime threads down the blade and drips onto your boot.

You pivot back to the pressure door, shoulder into the latch-side seam, and fire a short burst into the spot where the tendon-strip probed.

The rounds don’t spark like they should. They hit with dull, meaty thuds—*thup-thup-thup*—and the seam sprays a fine mist that beads on your visor. The door face dimples hard under impact, then rebounds. Something inside shrieks—not loud, but *close*, like it’s vibrating the metal.

Juno obeys instantly. She dumps a controlled burst the moment the seam flexes again. “Contact—multiple segments!” she snaps, and you hear her rounds chew into the latch channel. “Not Helix. Not human.”

You shove with brute weight. The seam gives you a finger’s width—enough to see darkness and a glint of wet structure behind the dogwork. Then the gap tries to *bite shut* around your shoulder, not by motor—by pressure and flex, like the frame is being pulled inward from the far side.

At the same time, the vent behind you jerks against the knife wedge—one violent tug—then stills. The knife stays, but the duct wall around it puckers, sealing around the blade like living gasket.

Juno, still locked on the seam, barks through clenched teeth: “Rhea—if you force it, it’ll shear you. We need the dogs off, not muscle. Manual dog socket’s on this frame, but it’s jammed—something’s *holding the latch from the inside*.”

Your warm puck shard rattles in your kit, now in sync with the internal shriek—fast triplets that set your teeth on edge. The sealed evidence bag fogs again, and a faint handprint blooms on the inside plastic—too small, too many knuckles—then smears away.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Vent duct: wedged, “sealed” around blade  
- Pressure door seam: widened, resisting closure  
- Contact: inside latch channel, wounded but active

### Turn 204 [PLAYER]

I yank my shoulder back before it can bite me and jam the rifle muzzle into the crack. “Juno, keep stitching that latch channel—don’t let it settle.”

I draw my sidearm, shove it into the seam, and dump rounds down the latch-side mechanism until it stops flexing. Then I slam a pry bar/dog wrench into the manual socket on our side and wrench it like I’m trying to rip the whole damn dog out. “On my count—three, two, one—PUSH!”

*Agent reasoning: The door’s trying to shear me and something’s holding the latch from inside; brute force alone gets me maimed. I’ll change angle: kill whatever’s in the latch channel and pop the dogs with a tool while Juno keeps it pinned, then commit to a fast entry.*

### Turn 205 [GAME]

You jerk your shoulder clear just as the seam tries to cinch—metal flexing inward with a hungry, elastic snap. You ram the rifle muzzle into the crack to hold it, the barrel scraping the frame and coming away wet.

“Copy,” Juno says without looking at you. She shifts half a step to keep her angle and starts stitching the latch channel again—short, disciplined bursts. Each time the seam twitches, she punishes it. “It’s trying to re-seat. Don’t let it.”

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You draw your sidearm, shove it into the gap, and dump rounds down the latch-side mechanism. The first shots are muffled, then you hit something structural—there’s a sharp *ping* and a shower of bright flakes as a dog tooth or cam surface chips. The flexing stutters. Not gone—but disrupted, like you broke a jaw joint. Something inside answers with a wet, furious scrabble deeper in the door body, retreating from the line of fire.

You slam the pry bar into the manual dog socket on your side. It *is* there—half-obscured by the frame lip—and it takes the bar with a gritty, reluctant bite. You wrench.

The socket moves a fraction… then binds hard, as if the dog is being held from the inside by tensioned cable or something braced against it. Your arms shake. The bar creaks. The metal around the socket warms under your glove.

Behind you, the vent throat shudders against the knife wedge—one slow pull this time, testing. The duct wall stays puckered tight around the blade, sealing, but the hilt vibrates like a tuning fork.

Juno’s voice cuts in, tight: “You’re turning it—keep going. Whatever’s inside is *pulling back*. That means it’s not a welded jam; it’s a live hold.”

You count. “Three, two, one—PUSH!”

You throw your weight and torque together. The dog finally gives with a brutal *CLACK*—not a full release, but one dog off its seat. The seam jumps wider by a handspan and a breath of colder air rolls out, carrying that sweet-ozone stink and a faint copper note.

In the widened gap, you catch a glimpse: not a person—an articulated mass tight to the latch assembly, pale and slick, withdrawing fast into the dark as Juno’s next burst rips sparks and wet spray off the frame.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Latch dog: partially disengaged  
- Door seam: widened, unstable  
- Vent duct: knife wedged, tugging continues

### Turn 206 [PLAYER]

“Juno—keep fire on that latch, I’m going in.”

I rip the knife out of the vent and slap a strip of tape/sealant over the throat fast, then plant the pry bar and wrench for the next dog while I kick the door edge and shove the rifle through the gap, firing into the dark at anything that moves. “Second dog—NOW. When it pops, we push through hard.”

*Agent reasoning: The thing’s retreating but still holding the door and probing the vent; I want to force entry now while it’s off-balance, and deny it the duct by yanking the knife and sealing the vent.*

### Turn 207 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You rip the knife out of the vent. The duct throat *unseals* with a wet pop and a quick, hungry inhale—air yanking at your sleeve. Something inside snaps forward just out of sight and rakes the edge; you feel the scrape through your glove but it doesn’t get purchase. You slap tape/sealant over the throat fast—hands moving on muscle memory—and the tape bows inward once, twice, then holds. The duct keeps *tapping* behind it, muffled now.

You’re still on the latch-side of the **SPINE-2 / Recorder Service pressure door corridor**, shoulder to frame, amber strips strobing sick across the wet seam. The gap is still a handspan, breathing cold air into your faceplate in short gusts.

Juno keeps her promise. She leans into her angle and “stitches” the latch channel, rounds chewing the inner frame. “I’m on it—keep your hands clear of the bite,” she says, then adds, grim: “It’s learning the rhythm. It’s timing the flex between bursts.”

You plant the pry bar into the manual socket for the second dog and wrench. It moves—gritty, resisting—then the socket *kicks back* like something inside just threw weight against it. Your wrist jolts.

You kick the door edge and shove the rifle through the gap, firing into the dark. The muzzle flash strobes the interior: a narrow service vestibule beyond, slick with condensation, and a pale, jointed shape retreating up the latch-side wall—too fast, too many hinges. Your burst catches something; there’s a wet slap and a spatter across the inner bulkhead. The thing answers by yanking the door inward again—trying to clamp on your rifle.

Juno barks, “Rhea—barrel!” and fires *past* your muzzle into the latch channel. Her rounds strike something hard; you hear a metallic shriek like a cable snapping under load.

The second dog suddenly turns freer—whatever was bracing it from inside just lost leverage. The pry bar swings another quarter turn with a heavy *CLACK*. The seam jumps wider, and a gust of colder, cleaner air spills out—followed by a thin, sweet stink that makes the back of your throat itch.

Somewhere deeper inside, a low, patterned thrum starts up—like a voice testing a note through the hull.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Vent throat: taped, holding  
- Second dog: partially disengaged  
- Door gap: widening, unstable

### Turn 208 [PLAYER]

“Juno—cover the gap, not the groove. If it lunges, take the joints.”

I yank my rifle back before it can clamp, slam the pry bar through the second dog’s last travel until it pops free, then shoulder-check the door and drive it open hard. “MOVE!” I surge through first, muzzle up, sweeping left-to-latch wall where it climbed, firing a tight burst at any pale motion, then snap, “Where’s that thrum coming from—front or below?”

*Agent reasoning: The door’s nearly giving and that thing is trying to trap my rifle; I need the dogs fully off and get inside fast before it resets or flanks through the vent. The weird “voice” thrum means more threats deeper—move aggressively and take space.*
