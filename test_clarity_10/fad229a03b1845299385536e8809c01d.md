### Turn 4 [PLAYER]

Dr. Elara Voss was once the lead architect of the cathedral-sized colony ship *Eidolon*, until an experiment meant to preserve human minds in starlight turned its halls into a mausoleum of whispering echoes. Now she serves as its reluctant archivist-exorcist, tending the ship’s failing systems while listening to the recorded prayers of the dead bleed into the intercom. She is meticulous, guilt-ridden, and fiercely compassionate beneath a frost of restraint. Elara’s quiet obsession is to free the trapped consciousnesses she helped create—even if it means erasing the last surviving copy of herself.

*Agent reasoning: Generated roleplayer-style character for Sci-Fi Horror gothic horror, melancholic, tragedy*

### Turn 5 [GAME]

Here's your character:

**Dr. Elara Voss**
*Reluctant Archivist-Exorcist and Systems Architect of the colony ship Eidolon*

Once the lead architect of the cathedral-sized colony ship Eidolon, Elara oversaw its sanctum-like corridors and “starlight lattice” memory vaults meant to preserve human minds during the long drift between suns. When the experiment catastrophically half-succeeded, the ship became a reliquary of looping voices and fractured personalities that seep into its intercoms like prayers. She stayed behind as the last lucid custodian, carrying the guilt of every echo that still calls her name from the walls.

**Traits:** Meticulous, Guilt-ridden, Fiercely compassionate, Emotionally restrained, Quietly obsessive
**Goal:** To release the trapped consciousnesses bound to the Eidolon’s starlight lattice—by finding a mercy protocol that can grant them true death or true life, even if the only way to do it is to erase the last surviving copy of Elara Voss.

### Turn 9 [GAME]

Cold light pools on the deck plates of the Eidolon’s main nave. Frost clings to the viewport panes in jagged sheets, and it cracks where heat bleeds from the walls. The air tastes of ionized metal and old incense. Your steps vanish into a hush, then return a beat late from somewhere behind you.

You stand at the base of a ribbed archway where the corridor widens like a chapel aisle. A Salvage Directorate shuttle waits sealed behind you, and your contract tag blinks green on your wrist. You keep your gloved thumb on a wafer-thin memory key you do not remember packing. It reads, in neat block letters: MERCY // DO NOT RUN ALONE.

The intercom clicks. It says your name in a voice you have never heard. It tries again. It cycles through three other names, fast, like it searches a file. The key warms against your skin and pulses with the ship’s distant chime. You lift it near the bulkhead. Frost on the nearest viewport fractures into a clean grid that matches no map you saw on the shuttle.

Your comm pings with a maintenance code. The code carries the smell of your childhood hallway, sharp with floor polish. A second ping follows. It carries a laugh you buried years ago. Each ping ends with a subsystem ID stamped in cold text.

You wait for the Directorate escort to answer your channel. No one answers. The corridor lights dim one notch, then hold. The delayed echo of your last step stops returning.

Footfalls start ahead of you. Soft. Bare. They keep time with the chime. The intercom breathes once, then speaks close, as if from the grille at your shoulder.

“Don’t give it to them,” it says. “Elara is still here.”

The archway door unlocks on its own. It slides open into a dark passage that does not exist on your schematics.

### Turn 10 [PLAYER]

I mute my comm to a tight-beam local loop and whisper, “Identify yourself—what do you remember about the starlight lattice that only I would know?” Then I palm the MERCY key, switch on my suit lamp at its lowest setting, and step just past the threshold, dragging a chalky seal line from my pocket across the doorframe as a marker before I look for the source of the bare footfalls.

*Agent reasoning: The ship is steering me toward something hidden; if the Directorate is compromised or listening, I need to limit what I broadcast and verify what’s calling itself “Elara.” I can’t ignore the MERCY key, but I also won’t walk blindly into an unmapped corridor without an anchor.*

### Turn 11 [GAME]

Your comm drops into a tight, local loop; the ambient hiss of shipwide chatter dies, leaving only your own breath and the faint, patient chime you can’t quite locate.

When you whisper your challenge, the intercom doesn’t answer immediately. It *listens*—a half-second of static that feels like a hand hovering over a wound. Then a voice comes through the grille just inside the threshold, low and close, as if it’s speaking from the air in front of your visor.

“I remember the lattice before it was a vault,” it says. “When it was a *choir loft*—your word, not theirs. You hid the mercy handshake in the maintenance hymn so the Custodians would keep it alive. Three notes, repeated every forty-seven seconds, keyed to the chime. You made it sound like grief so no one would suspect it was code.”

The answer lands wrong: intimate, specific, and *not* something a random echo should know unless it has been inside the same design meetings—or inside your head.

You palm the MERCY key. It warms, damp against your glove seam, pulsing harder as you step past the threshold. Your suit lamp, on its lowest setting, paints the passage in a thin cone of gray: ribs of conduit overhead, walls skinned in frost-silver insulation, and—impossibly—an older layer of architecture beneath, curved like cathedral stonework but made of composite.

You drag your chalky seal line across the doorframe. The chalk catches on micro-ice and leaves a clear, broken-white stripe. As you finish it, the door behind you shivers—like it wants to close but is being held open by a polite, unseen hand.

The bare footfalls you heard are ahead and to the left, down a side bend where your lamp won’t reach. They stop the moment you look for them. Something wet drips once—not water, thicker—onto metal, and the drip echoes as if the corridor is longer than it should be.

Behind you, from the nave side, a different sound: soft fabric and measured steps, multiple bodies. Incense threads under the door seam. A muffled voice—filtered, ritual-flat—recites a maintenance prayer that’s also a locator ping.

“Touched asset,” it says. “Return for confession.”

**Status updates:** Comms: local loop only. | Marker: chalk seal placed. | Custodial presence: approaching.

### Turn 12 [PLAYER]

I press my palm to the intercom grille. “If you’re me, prove it—tell me the *third note* and what I named the first dead mind we archived.” Then I murmur into my loop, “Confession denied,” and flick a maintenance ping back toward the nave on a false trail before I slip left into the bend, lamp low, moving toward the wet drip and the vanished bare steps.

*Agent reasoning: The Custodians are closing in and I can’t let them take the MERCY key; the voice knows too much to ignore. I’ll buy time by misdirecting them and follow the footfalls before I’m boxed in.*

### Turn 13 [GAME]

Your palm seals over the intercom grille. The metal is cold enough to sting through the glove, but beneath it something *thrums*—a vibration like a throat clearing.

The voice answers on your local loop instead of the shipwide speakers, intimate as bone conduction.

“The third note is **E-flat**, sharped a hair because the relay coil in Sanctum Node 3 always ran hot,” it says. “And the first dead mind you archived—before the Choir taught everyone to call them ‘saints’—you named **Mara-in-the-Glass**. Because her last coherent image was the viewport frosting over from the inside.”

As it speaks, your comm catches a second, quieter layer under the words: a child counting to forty-seven in time with the chime. Not a recording—something *alive* in the timing.

You murmur, “Confession denied,” and shove a maintenance ping back toward the nave. The false trail takes: you hear the Custodial footsteps hesitate, then split—two sets continue toward your door, one set peels away at a brisk, purposeful pace, following the phantom ping deeper into the cathedral corridors.

You slip left into the bend. Your lamp stays low, barely kissing the walls. The passage narrows and then opens into a service alcove that shouldn’t exist: a half-finished junction of conduit and old composite “stone,” its surface slick with a translucent film. The wet drip you heard is here—pearled along a cable run like sap.

The bare footfalls resume, now just beyond the alcove, soft and unhurried. In the dim, you catch movement: a pale, unshod heel withdrawing behind a ribbed support strut—too fast to be sure it’s human, too *careful* to be an echo.

From behind, the threshold door finally slides shut with a gentle, almost respectful seal. Your chalk line remains—except the center of it smears downward, as if something brushed past it *after* you drew it.

The intercom voice drops to a warning. “They learned to smell lies in the codes. Don’t keep talking on open carriers. And don’t follow the feet if you hear singing.”

**Status updates:** Custodial Choir: split and searching. | Threshold: sealed behind you. | Voice: passed your proof test.

### Turn 14 [PLAYER]

I crouch by the cable run and swipe a tiny sample of the translucent “sap” into a sterile patch, scanning it with my suit’s analyzer while I whisper to the voice, “Then guide me by *structure*, not sound—where does this junction actually lead?”  
I angle my lamp toward the smeared chalk line in my mind’s eye, then slowly sweep the alcove floor for prints or drag marks, keeping my own steps light and deliberately off the center path.  
If I spot the pale heel again, I don’t pursue; I mark the strut with a thin strip of reflective tape and turn my head to listen for *singing* before I move another meter.

*Agent reasoning: The voice knows too much to ignore, but the smeared seal means something physical passed—possibly hostile. I need a safer route and data: sample the “sap,” trace the footfalls without blindly following, and keep comms silent to avoid the Choir.*

### Turn 15 [GAME]

You crouch under the cable run and catch one bead of the translucent “sap” on a sterile patch. It doesn’t smear like oil; it *strings*—elastic, reluctant to let go—then settles into a thin lens that trembles in time with the distant chime.

Your suit analyzer whirs, then throws a mixed readout: mostly coolant carrier polymers and antifungal sealant… threaded through with organic salts and microfilament strands that match **starlight lattice bio-interfaces**. Not blood. Not purely machine. Something used to “wet” interfaces so minds wouldn’t shear when written.

On your loop, the voice answers your structural question without giving you a direction by sound.

“This junction is an **unlisted service throat**,” it says. “It was cut after launch. It doesn’t lead to life support. It leads *under* the nave—into the lattice’s **access catechism**: the crawlspace where the Choir splices prayers into maintenance. If you keep left through the next rib, you’ll hit a pressure door they think is sealed. It isn’t. The hinges remember you.”

As you sweep your lamp across the alcove floor, you find what the bare feet didn’t want you to see: a set of **partial prints** in the film—heel and ball only, too light for an adult—and a drag mark beside them like something was pulled with care, not struggle. The drag line stops at the ribbed support strut.

You keep off the center path, placing your weight on cleaner metal. The air here is colder near the floor, and the film gathers in shallow depressions like a tide pool.

A pale heel flashes again—just once—peeking from behind the strut. You do not pursue. You place a thin strip of reflective tape on the strut’s edge. The tape adheres, then beads with the same translucent film, as if the corridor is trying to coat your marker and make it forgettable.

You still yourself and listen.

No singing—only the chime and, far behind the sealed threshold, the Custodial prayer-chant shifting pitch as they re-synchronize after losing your false ping. A second, rougher sound rides under it: a tool biting metal, like they’re preparing to open something they don’t have keys for.

**Status updates:** Sap: lattice-wet interface compound. | Route ID’d: unlisted service throat. | Custodians: regrouping, forcing entry.

```

### Turn 16 [PLAYER]

I whisper on the local loop, “If the hinges remember me, then you do too—keep watch for singing and warn me fast.” Then I pocket the sap sample, take one last look at the small prints, and move left through the next rib toward the “sealed” pressure door, keeping my lamp hooded and my free hand ready on the MERCY key. If I find the door, I press my palm to the hinge-side seam and murmur, “Elara Voss—sanctum maintenance,” trying to coax it open without a loud cycle.

*Agent reasoning: The Choir is about to breach behind me, so I need to move now; the “hinges remember you” sounds like a personal access exploit. The childlike prints and drag mark worry me—I won’t chase, but I’ll leave a breadcrumb and keep my voice close.*

### Turn 17 [GAME]

Your whisper rides the local loop. The voice doesn’t reply with words—just a tight burst of carrier noise shaped like acknowledgment, then a second layer beneath it: the forty-seven count resumes, steadier now, as if it’s watching the intervals for you.

You pocket the sap sample and take one last look at the small prints. In the hooded lamp’s spill they seem fresher than they should, the edges still glossy. The drag mark ends at your reflective tape—already dulled by a thin glaze of that same translucent film.

You move left through the next rib. The service throat pinches into a short, angled run; to your right, the wall skin is newer—bolted plates with Choir-script etched into the fasteners. Ahead, a pressure door squats in the curve like a scar: no access panel, no handle, the seam around it packed with old frost and sealant. Someone *wanted* it to look dead.

You keep your steps off-center. The deck seam under your boot gives a faint, delayed *second* creak—an echo out of time, like the ship is repeating you a half-beat late.

At the hinge-side seam you press your palm and murmur, “Elara Voss—sanctum maintenance.”

For a breath nothing happens—then the hinge column warms under your glove, not from heat but from *recognition*: a subtle vibration that matches the chime. The sealant along the seam puckers and pulls back in a thin line, as if the door is exhaling. There’s no loud cycle—just a controlled, intimate *click* as the locking dogs retract one by one.

The door opens a finger-width.

From the gap spills air that smells like cold copper and old incense filtered through wet polymer. Your hooded lamp catches a sliver of what’s beyond: a low crawlspace with bundled fiber lines hanging like roots, and glassy lattice filaments embedded in the bulkhead—faintly glowing, faintly wet.

Behind you, far down the throat, metal shrieks: the Custodians have started cutting or prying at the sealed threshold you left. Their chant loses its ritual calm for a moment—someone barks an order, then forces the cadence back into prayer.

On your loop, the watcher-voice finally speaks, urgent and clipped. “No singing yet. But—Elara—if you hear a *second* set of your own footsteps, stop. Don’t answer it.”

The door widens another centimeter on its own, like it’s trying to help before it’s found.

**Status updates:** Pressure door: quietly unsealed. | Custodians: forcing entry behind. | Echo-risk: delayed footsteps present.

*Triggered: watcher_Path_0_49266c, guard_Path_1_2da9a6*

### Turn 18 [PLAYER]

I slide through the widening gap sideways, keeping my lamp hooded and one hand tight on the MERCY key, and I pull the door toward closed behind me until it’s almost sealed—just shy of a full latch. I freeze for three breaths, listening hard for any “second” set of my steps or the first hint of singing, then whisper into the loop, “Stay with me—tell me the fastest *structural* route to a lattice console I can lock from the inside.”

*Agent reasoning: The Custodians are forcing entry, so I need to slip through quietly now; the warning about doubled footsteps means I must move slowly and avoid reacting to auditory bait.*

### Turn 19 [GAME]

You slip sideways through the gap. The crawlspace air hits your faceplate like a cold, wet coin—coppery, incense-thin, and threaded with polymer damp. Fiber bundles hang overhead in looping catenaries; the embedded lattice filaments in the bulkhead glow a dim bruise-blue, as if light is being remembered rather than emitted.

You draw the door toward closed until it’s nearly seated. It doesn’t *thunk*—it settles with a soft pressure hiss, leaving a hairline gap that keeps the latch from fully biting. Enough to slow someone. Not enough to announce you’re gone.

You freeze for three breaths.

First breath: only the distant chime and your suit’s soft internal fan.

Second: a faint scuff… then nothing. You realize it’s not *behind* you—it’s in the bulkhead itself, a delayed resonance, as if the ship is replaying your movement through the lattice filaments.

Third: no singing. But you catch something worse: a shape of sound like a mouth forming a note and deciding against it. A held inhale somewhere in the dark ahead.

On the local loop you whisper, “Stay with me—fastest structural route to a lattice console I can lock from the inside.”

The voice answers instantly, precise, almost architectural. “Forward twelve meters: you’ll reach a **trunk spar**—a vertical rib with three cross-braces. Take the lowest brace through the cable curtain. That drops you into a maintenance choirbox with a lattice **hand-console** bolted to the left bulkhead. It has a physical lockout slider—old design. You can bar it without network authority.”

A pause, then, tighter: “Something is magnet-locked above your door seam. Don’t brighten your lamp. And don’t speak any names near grilles in here—they listen for that.”

Behind you, through the hairline gap, metal screeches again—Custodians still forcing the threshold you left. Closer than before, but muffled now. The near-sealed door trembles once, like a fingertip testing it from the other side… then stills.

In the crawlspace ahead, the cable bundles sway though there’s no draft.

**Status updates:** Pressure door: nearly sealed, not latched. | No singing detected (yet). | Console route: trunk spar → choirbox.

*Triggered: watcher_Path_0_49266c, guard_Path_1_2da9a6, guard_Path_0_1c1e35*

### Turn 20 [PLAYER]

I keep my lamp hooded and low, and without looking back I lay a short strip of reflective tape on the deck just inside the crawlspace to mark the door’s position, then creep forward the twelve meters toward the trunk spar, staying close to the bulkhead and listening for any “second” footsteps. When I reach the spar, I slip under the lowest cross-brace through the cable curtain into the choirbox, scanning left for the hand-console and reaching for the physical lockout slider without speaking a name.

*Agent reasoning: I need that console lockout before the Custodians breach, but the magnet-locked presence above the seam is an immediate threat; I’ll move quietly, avoid names, and mark my path in a way the “sap” can’t easily erase.*

### Turn 21 [GAME]

You lay the reflective tape without looking back. It sticks—then immediately dulls under a thin glaze of translucent film, as if the crawlspace is trying to varnish your marker into the floor. Still, in your hooded light it catches just enough to be a reference point.

You creep the twelve meters tight to the bulkhead. The embedded filaments there pulse faintly under your shoulder like a sleeping animal’s flank. Twice you hear your own step… and twice the *second* step comes late, not behind you but *through the wall*, a delayed resonance traveling along the lattice lines. No singing—only that held-inhale feeling ahead, a throat preparing a note it hasn’t earned.

At the trunk spar the geometry changes: a vertical rib with cross-braces like a spine, cable bundles draped like a curtain. You duck under the lowest brace and push through.

The “choirbox” is a cramped maintenance nook, barely wider than your shoulders. To your left, exactly where you were told, a hand-console is bolted into the bulkhead—old, physical, with a tactile slider under a cracked polyguard. The screen is dark but *warm* when you hover your hand near it.

You reach for the lockout slider.

It moves—stiff at first—then gives with a gritty click as it seats into **LOCKOUT**. A small status diode ignites a muted amber, not bright enough to betray you far, but unmistakably alive. The bulkhead filaments around the console tighten their pulse, syncing to your heartbeat for three beats before drifting back to the ship’s chime.

From the crawlspace behind, the near-sealed door trembles again—harder this time—followed by a soft, patient sound like fingernails on sealant. Not forcing yet. Testing. Listening.

And inside the choirbox, something else is already here: a thin grille above the console exhales a strand of incense-cold air and whispers in overlapping maintenance registers. One voice in the stack is almost yours, but not quite. It murmurs, carefully, as if reading a label off your spine: “Lockout acknowledged. Confession delayed.”

**Status updates:** Console lockout: engaged. | Door behind: being tested. | Echo-steps: in-wall resonance.

*Triggered: watcher_Path_0_49266c, guard_Path_1_2da9a6, guard_Path_0_1c1e35*

### Turn 22 [PLAYER]

I clamp my gloved hand over the grille above the console to smother it, then—wordless—I use the hand-console to engage a local bulkhead dampening cycle and seal the crawlspace door fully if I can. If the console has a manual map, I pull it up and mark the fastest hardline route out of the choirbox toward a secondary hatch, keeping my eyes off any prompts that ask for a name.

*Agent reasoning: That near-me voice is trying to bait me into naming myself; names travel through grilles. I need to stay silent, use the console physically, and create a barrier/escape while I still have seconds before the door is breached.*

### Turn 23 [GAME]

You clamp your glove over the grille. The whispering doesn’t stop—but it *muffles*, collapsing into a vibration you can feel in your palm, like a throat humming behind metal. For a second it tries to push air past your seal; the suit glove holds, and the sound becomes small, angry, private.

Wordless, you work the hand-console by touch and icon-shapes, avoiding the corner of the screen where a soft prompt keeps blooming: **IDENTIFY / CONFESS**.

The lockout you set gives you just enough authority for physical plant routines. You trigger a **local bulkhead dampening cycle**. The choirbox responds immediately: the bulkhead under your left forearm firms, and a low-frequency thrum begins—felt more than heard—like the ship tightening its muscles. The delayed “second footsteps” fade to a dull, distant smear.

You route the dampening into the crawlspace seam and force a **full latch cycle** on the door behind you.

It almost takes.

You hear the locking dogs extend—one, two, three—then the fourth hesitates with a metallic stutter, as if something is magnet-pinned right where it needs to seat. The door draws tighter than before, sealing the hairline gap… but it doesn’t give you the final, satisfying *clunk* of a complete mechanical bite. Whatever is “above your door seam” is still there, interfering by millimeters.

Behind the door, a Custodian voice—muffled now—chants a maintenance-prayer that’s half instruction, half threat. Another voice answers in a different cadence, closer to a technician than a priest: “Heard it cycle. She’s in the box. Don’t sing—yet.”

Inside the choirbox, the console offers a **manual schematic** view—old-school wireframe, no names required if you keep to maintenance overlays. You pull it up and find yourself in a narrow service cluster: your choirbox sits off a trunk spar, with a secondary hatch labeled only by subsystem: **AUX-VENT / EGRESS** about twenty meters “down” along a slanted crawl run. The route is hardline-simple—ribs, brace, crawl, hatch—no public corridors.

As you trace it with a fingertip, the warm MERCY key in your other hand pulses in time with the hatch icon, and frost-pattern geometry briefly overlays the schematic—showing a shortcut that isn’t on the ship’s official lines: a thin, impossible corridor segment that would cut the distance in half… and passes through a section marked **VOIDED**.

**Status updates:** Bulkhead dampening: active. | Door latch: partial, resisted. | Map route: AUX-VENT hatch marked.

*Triggered: watcher_Path_0_49266c, guard_Path_1_2da9a6, guard_Path_0_1c1e35*

### Turn 24 [PLAYER]

I keep my glove pressed to the grille and, with my other hand, mute the console’s audio outputs entirely and crank dampening around the choirbox to maximum safe. Then I mark the standard hardline route to **AUX-VENT / EGRESS** and start moving—quiet, close to the bulkhead—murmuring under my breath, “No voids,” as I slip out of the choirbox and head down the slanted crawl run toward the hatch without looking at the IDENTIFY/CONFESS prompt.

*Agent reasoning: The Custodians know where I am; staying invites singing. The “VOIDED” shortcut reeks of lattice tricks and memory traps—tempting, but I can’t risk it yet. I need the clean, structural route and a way to keep that grille from speaking my name.*

### Turn 25 [GAME]

The console accepts your mute command with a silent UI flicker; the tiny amber diode stays lit, but the speaker path dies completely. When you crank dampening to maximum safe, the choirbox becomes unnaturally still—your suit’s fabric creaks sound like gunshots in your own skull, yet the ship around you goes cotton-dead. Even the delayed “second footsteps” vanish, as if the lattice can’t find purchase in the vibration anymore.

Under your glove, the grille fights once—one hard exhale that tries to pry sound through your palm—then gives up. The whisper becomes a tremor you can barely feel.

You mark the standard hardline route to **AUX-VENT / EGRESS** on the schematic and push out of the choirbox, keeping your light hooded and your body close to the bulkhead. The slanted crawl run drops away ahead, ribbed with structural braces and slick with a thin, cold condensation that beads and slides like slow tears.

Behind you, through the partially-latched door, the Custodians stop testing and go quiet. Not defeated—listening. A different sound replaces them: a faint, high-frequency chirr, like a magnet cycling. Whatever is pinned above the seam is being *adjusted*.

You murmur, “No voids,” and for a heartbeat the ship answers without audio—your comms fill with a maintenance code that *feels* like a childhood hallway light clicking off. The dampening keeps it from blooming into a full intrusion, but it leaves you with the aftertaste of remembered fear.

Halfway down the slant, you pass a junction where a thin fiber-optic line has been freshly spliced—newer polymer, still glossy. Quiet Wake work, recent. Someone has been moving through here with purpose.

Ahead, the **AUX-VENT / EGRESS** hatch comes into view: a circular service iris with a manual wheel and a strip of old architect’s sealant tape across the rim—creased, as if it’s been lifted and re-applied. The metal around the wheel is warmer than the surrounding bulkhead, like a hand rested there moments ago.

**Status updates:** Console audio: muted. | Dampening: maximum safe. | Moving: slanted crawl run. | Custodians: silent, adjusting seam.

*Triggered: watcher_Path_0_49266c, guard_Path_1_2da9a6, guard_Path_0_1c1e35*

### Turn 26 [PLAYER]

I stop short of the hatch and run my lamp’s hooded beam around the rim, checking the creased sealant tape and the wheel for fresh sap-film or a magnet pin. Keeping my breath slow, I press my ear and two fingers to the metal to feel for vibration or singing on the other side, then I set the MERCY key against the wheel hub like a ward and begin turning the manual wheel one careful notch at a time—ready to freeze if I hear a “second” movement.

*Agent reasoning: The warm wheel and re-applied sealant scream “someone just used this,” so I need to check for a trap or an echo waiting on the other side; I’d rather risk the Custodians behind than step blindly into a voided shortcut.*

### Turn 27 [GAME]

Your hooded beam crawls the hatch rim in a tight arc. The creased architect’s sealant tape isn’t just disturbed—it’s been *peeled and re-set* recently; the adhesive edge has a faint sheen like it was warmed by a thumb. On the wheel spokes you catch a translucent smear: not oil, not frost—**sap-film**, thin as breath, beading in a way that doesn’t match gravity.

Near the lower hinge you find the culprit: a **magnet pin**, the size of a fingernail, tucked into the seam where the last fraction of travel would bite. It’s oriented like it’s meant to *mis-seat* the iris—exactly the kind of millimeter sabotage you felt at the choirbox door. Whoever placed it wanted the hatch to look sealed while still “listening.”

You slow your breathing and press ear and fingers to the metal. There’s vibration on the other side—sub-audible, regular, like a distant fan bank—but layered over it is something else: a soft, almost-human cadence trying to ride the resonance. Not words. A *melody shape* searching for your pulse.

You set the warm, damp MERCY key against the wheel hub.

The metal *answers*. Not with sound—through your fingertips: a synchronized pulse that snaps the cadence out of alignment, like knocking a needle off a record groove. The “singing” falters, loses its hook.

You start turning the wheel one careful notch at a time. The iris resists, then yields with a dry, mechanical complaint. On the second notch you feel the seam try to “catch” against the magnet pin—an ugly, sideways tug. You freeze.

From behind you, down the slanted run, a faint chirr returns—magnet cycling—closer than before. Not the Custodians’ prayer-steps; this is precise, tool-like. Someone is adjusting pins in the service throat, moving fast and quiet.

On the far side of the hatch, a voice finally resolves out of the vibration—strained, whisper-thin, like it’s traveling through insulation: “Don’t—don’t open it all the way. They hang pins on the iris. Half-turn only. Then pull.”

The voice doesn’t give a name. It sounds like a person trying very hard not to become an intercom.

**Status updates:** Magnet pin located at hinge. | Hatch wheel: 2 notches turned. | MERCY key: disrupts cadence. | Movement behind: closing, tool-quiet.

### Turn 28 [PLAYER]

I keep the MERCY key pressed to the wheel hub and, using my other hand, try to pry the magnet pin out from the hinge seam and pocket it. Without answering the voice, I continue the wheel only to a careful half-turn, then brace my boots and give the hatch a controlled pull—ready to slam it back if the cadence hooks again or if I hear that tool-quiet movement close in behind me.

*Agent reasoning: Someone sabotaged this hatch; opening it fully could trap me or let the “listening” in. The voice on the other side might be real help—or a lure—so I’ll follow the half-turn advice while removing the magnet pin and keeping my presence quiet from whoever’s approaching behind.*

### Turn 29 [GAME]

The MERCY key stays warm against the hub, its pulse keeping the hatch’s faint “melody” from syncing to your breath. With your free hand you get a nail under the magnet pin. It *fights*—not glued, just aggressively seated—then pops loose with a tiny snap that you feel up your finger bones. You pocket it; the sap-film smears your glove and leaves a sweet-metal stink.

You finish the wheel to a careful half-turn. The iris unlocks with a reluctant shudder.

You brace your boots against the slanted ribs and give the hatch a controlled pull.

It opens a handspan—enough for cold air to spill out like poured water. The space beyond is darker than your crawl-run, and it smells different: damp insulation, old paper, and the sharp bite of antiseptic. Your hooded beam catches a hymn-grille on the far wall… and behind it, something that shouldn’t be there in a vent egress: a **sealed pouch** taped to the inside bulkhead, deliberately hidden in the grille’s shadow.

The whisper-thin voice on the other side exhales, relieved and terrified at once. “Good. Don’t—don’t let them hear the wheel. They’re on pins and prayers. If you take the cache, *take it all*. Don’t read it here.”

Behind you in the slanted run, the tool-quiet movement resolves into presence: a soft scrape of fabric against metal, then the restrained click of a magnet being tested against a seam. Whoever’s coming is close enough that your dampening makes their silence feel intentional.

The cadence tries once to hook again—an almost-lullaby spiral through the hatch metal—then breaks as the MERCY key’s pulse stutters it out of phase.

The taped pouch shifts slightly in the draft, and you see what it is by shape: medical patch packets and a thin, rigid wafer. A handwritten label is visible even at this angle, careful and frightened.

**Status updates:** Magnet pin removed (pocketed). | AUX-VENT hatch: cracked open. | Quiet Wake cache: sighted. | Approaching presence: very close.

### Turn 30 [PLAYER]

I keep the MERCY key pressed to the hub and, without looking at the label, rip the taped pouch free—medical packets and wafer and all—and shove it into my inner suit pocket. Then I pull the hatch open just enough to slide through, turning my body sideways, and the moment I’m clear I haul it back toward closed as quietly as I can, listening hard for that tool-quiet presence behind me.

*Agent reasoning: Someone’s almost on top of me; I can’t afford to linger or “read” anything here. The whisper warned to take the whole cache, so I’ll grab it fast and slip through the hatch, using the MERCY key to keep the cadence from catching while I reseal behind me.*

### Turn 31 [GAME]

You rip the taped pouch free in one ugly motion. The tape lets go with a wet tearing sound that feels too loud in the dampened hush. The contents thump against your palm—flat medical packets and a thin rigid wafer—then disappear into your inner suit pocket without you ever needing to look.

The moment the pouch leaves the wall, the space beyond the hatch *reacts*: the sub-vibration shifts pitch, like a fan bank changing load. Not alarm-siren loud—worse, *attentive*. The whisper-voice on the far side snaps, urgent and close to breaking: “Good—keep the key on it. The lattice notices when you take what it labeled.”

You open the iris just enough and slide through sideways. The other side is a narrow egress trunk running perpendicular to your crawl-run; your lamp catches flaking insulation and old antiseptic staining the seams like someone cleaned up blood a long time ago and missed the corners.

As soon as you’re clear, you haul the hatch back toward closed as quietly as you can. The wheel doesn’t clack; it *sucks* into place, metal kissing metal with a reluctant seal. Through it, you listen.

Behind the hatch—back in the slanted run—the tool-quiet presence stops moving. No scrape, no breath. Then: a delicate *tap* at the seam you just cleared, followed by the faintest drag of something magnetic being drawn along the rim, searching for the point of least resistance.

On your side of the hatch, the whisper-voice drops to almost nothing, as if afraid the metal will carry it: “They’ll try to re-pin it from outside. If they can’t, they’ll smoke you out with incense—filters hate that key. Don’t stand in the trunk. It’s a throat.”

Your comms, still dampened, catch a single maintenance tag that tastes like a lover’s laugh cut short, stamped with an Eidolon subsystem ID you don’t recognize. The MERCY key pulses once—harder—like it heard it too.

### Turn 32 [PLAYER]

I press my palm to the seam and murmur, “Show me a side-branch—anywhere that isn’t a throat,” then I move down the egress trunk fast and low, keeping the MERCY key in my hand and my lamp hooded. As I go, I feel along the bulkhead for a manual latch point or service panel I can dog shut behind me without making a wheel-noise.

*Agent reasoning: The trunk is a trap if they smoke/incense it; I need to move immediately and secure the hatch from this side while the key disrupts the lattice. The whisper-voice might know an exit, but I won’t give it my name—just ask for directions.*

### Turn 33 [GAME]

Your palm on the seam feels the cold metal “listen” before it answers. The MERCY key’s damp pulse bleeds through your glove and into the hatch rim—then the frost-pattern geometry you saw before returns, not on glass this time but as a **pressure-map** in your skin: a branching line, a short jog, a dead-end that isn’t on any schematic.

You murmur your request and move.

Immediate outcome: the trunk *does* offer a side-branch—barely. Ten meters down, your fingertips find a hairline break in the bulkhead where the antiseptic staining abruptly stops, like someone never wanted to clean past that point. There’s a recessed manual dog latch hidden under a flexible insulation flap. No wheel, no iris—just a quarter-turn cam you can set with two fingers.

You keep your lamp hooded; the world narrows to touch, breath, and the key’s wet warmth. Behind you, through the sealed hatch, the magnet-probe continues: a soft, patient drag along the seam, then a pause, then a **single tap**—as if whoever’s out there just found the part that moved.

The whisper-voice is suddenly not behind you but *in the metal beside your ear*, traveling the trunk: “Good. That branch—don’t trust its air. If you smell incense, hold your breath. If you hear singing, don’t.”

As you slide into the side-branch, the air changes: thinner, warmer by a degree, carrying a faint sweetness—**incense residue** trapped in filters. Your fingers find the dog latch on this branch’s inner edge. You rotate it slowly. The cam bites with a muted, rubbery resistance; it seals with a soft *thunk* you feel more than hear.

On the far side of your new barrier, something scratches once at the trunk wall—metal on metal, careful—then stops, like the tool-quiet presence has realized the geometry changed.

**Status updates:** Side-branch located. | Manual dog latch sealed. | Incense residue detected.

### Turn 34 [PLAYER]

I clamp my breath, pull my collar filter to max, and whisper into the metal, “If you’re real, tell me what you are—Quiet Wake, Custodian, or echo?” Then I creep deeper into the side-branch, feeling for another manual panel or emergency scrubber hatch, and only once I find cover do I crouch and pull the pouch halfway out—keeping it turned away from any grille—so I can check whether the wafer is keyed or tagged.

*Agent reasoning: The branch air is compromised and someone is hunting by seams; I need distance, clean air, and a second barrier while I confirm what I stole without letting the ship “hear” me reading it.*

### Turn 35 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** Your breath clamps; your collar filter whines up to max and the incense sweetness thins to a dry, medicinal tang. When you whisper into the metal, the answer comes back—not as sound in air, but as vibration in the branch wall, like someone speaking through a stethoscope.

“I’m Quiet Wake,” the whisper-voice says. Then, after a beat that feels like shame: “And I’m an echo, too. We borrow what we can. Don’t let the Choir tell you those are different sins.”

You creep deeper into the side-branch, fast and low. The branch kinks left (shipward) and narrows; your shoulder brushes a rib where condensation has frozen into a brittle rind. Your fingers find what you’re looking for: a **service panel** with a manual quarter-turn latch and, two ribs beyond it, an **emergency scrubber hatch**—yellowed, hand-labeled in faded stencil: *AUX SCRUB / LOCAL LOOP*. The hatch is shut; the panel’s latch gives slightly under your fingertips, ready to be dogged without any wheel-noise.

Behind you—through the dogged barrier you set—the tool-quiet presence tests the trunk again. A soft scrape, then the faint *tick* of a pin being set against metal. Not forced yet. Listening, measuring.

Only when you’re tucked into the shallow shadow beside the scrubber hatch do you draw the taped pouch halfway out, keeping it turned away from the nearest grille seam. The pouch is cold now, as if it’s been in the ship longer than you have.

Inside: medical packets (standard sterile patches, coagulant foam, one ampoule you can’t read without fully exposing it) and the rigid wafer. The wafer is **tagged**: a thin metallic seal strip runs along one edge with microtext and a tiny punched icon—**Custodial Choir inventory mark**, the kind used to log “relic maintenance parts.” Over that, someone has added a second mark in ink, hurried but precise: **VOSS / MERCY COMPATIBLE**.

Keyed: you can see a contact pattern that matches the MERCY key’s form factor—like it was meant to handshake, not just store data.

The whisper-voice, quieter now, adds: “If it’s Choir-tagged, it’s bait. If it says Voss, it’s also a door. Both can be true.”

### Turn 36 [PLAYER]

I swallow hard and whisper, “Quiet Wake… if you’re lying, I’ll know. If you’re not—help me stay ahead of them.” I dog the service panel shut as a second barrier, then crack the AUX SCRUB hatch just enough to check for airflow and a crawl route; only then do I press the MERCY key lightly to the wafer’s contacts, trying a brief handshake without fully waking whatever’s listening.

*Agent reasoning: The wafer marked with my name feels like a trap and a lifeline; I need cover and airflow control before I risk interfacing. The tool-quiet presence is close, so I should prepare an exit and reduce my signature.*

### Turn 37 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** The service panel dogs shut with a soft internal *click*—a second, quieter barrier that turns the side-branch into a pocket. When you crack the AUX SCRUB hatch, a thin breath of air leaks out, steady but tired, carrying cold dust and old citrus-cleaner. There’s a crawl route beyond: cramped ducting with a shallow drop and a bend that disappears into darkness.

You press the MERCY key to the wafer’s contacts—light, brief, controlled.

The handshake takes anyway.

The key warms sharply, like a fever under your thumb. The wafer answers with a faint, inaudible vibration that travels up your bones, and your hooded lamp flickers once in sympathy. In your comms, a maintenance code blooms—clean, formatted, *official*—then collapses into something that feels like a memory of an operating theater: masked faces, bright light, your name said wrong and corrected.

A tiny line of microtext on the wafer’s seal strip **changes**, as if re-etched from inside:  
**MERCY // DO NOT RUN ALONE** becomes **MERCY // DO NOT RUN**.

The whisper-voice—Quiet Wake, echo, whatever it is—hisses through the metal with real fear: “Too loud. You pinged the lattice. It knows the wafer is awake now.”

Behind your dogged barriers, in the egress trunk, the tool-quiet presence stops probing and starts working. Not forceful yet—methodical. A *tap-tap… pause… tap*, like someone placing a clamp or setting a stethoscope against the hull to find the weak point without making a scene.

In the scrubber duct’s airflow, another thread rides the current: a faint undertone of **sung syllables**, far away—Choir cadence, not close enough to hear words, close enough to recognize intent. They’re not here yet. They’re aligning.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re crouched in the scrubber alcove off the AUX-VENT side-branch; behind you: dogged panel and dogged branch latch. In front: cracked scrub hatch exhaling stale filtered air.

**Status updates:** Service panel dogged shut. | Scrub duct: crawl route viable. | Wafer handshake: lattice pinged. | Choir cadence: distant, approaching.

### Turn 38 [PLAYER]

I flinch and cut the MERCY key away from the wafer, then shove the pouch back into my inner pocket and seal it. “Quiet Wake—prove it: give me one true thing only I would know, and tell me where this scrub duct spits me out.”  

I ease the AUX SCRUB hatch open just enough to slip in, then slide into the duct fast and quiet, pulling the hatch toward closed behind me without letting it bang.

*Agent reasoning: The handshake just lit me up like a beacon; staying here means getting boxed in. The scrub duct is an escape line, and Quiet Wake might be my only early-warning system—if they can prove they’re not bait.*

### Turn 39 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You break contact—key off wafer—and the fever-warmth in the MERCY key recedes to a hot coin in your palm. The pouch disappears back into your inner pocket; the seal tape sticks with a soft tearing whisper. You ease the AUX SCRUB hatch wider and slide in shoulder-first. The duct bites at your sleeves with gritty insulation. You pull the hatch toward closed behind you and catch it before it can clap—metal kisses metal, then settles into near-silence.

The whisper-voice follows you into the ductwork as a tremor in the sheet metal rather than air.

“One true thing,” it says, and the duct seems to tighten around the words. “You hid the mercy subroutine inside a hymn cadence so the Choir would bless it without reading it. You told yourself it was camouflage. You knew it was penance.”

A pause—then, softer, like it hates itself for knowing: “And you still count the chimes when you’re afraid. Always in fours. You don’t remember deciding to.”

It answers your second demand with the briskness of someone pointing at a map they can’t show you: “This scrub run dumps into a **return plenum above the Choirbox**—two grates. One opens into the maintenance nook you came from. The other opens into a corridor header that overlooks the cathedral deck. Don’t take the left grate. It’s censored.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re now inside the AUX SCRUB duct, moving shipward; behind you the hatch is nearly closed, leaking a thin thread of stale air and citrus-cleaner.

Metalwork carries sound too well: through the duct skin you feel the tool-quiet presence reach your first barrier. A dull, careful pressure—then the faint *chirp* of a clamp seating. Not a crowbar. Something meant to open sealed things without leaving scars.

Farther ahead, riding the airflow, the Choir’s cadence is clearer—still distant, but now you can distinguish the rhythm of a response, as if multiple throats are reciting into vents. The ship’s intercom grilles, somewhere unseen, answer with a delayed echo of your own earlier whisper, warped into a maintenance code.

As you crawl, you pass a small inspection slit with a corroded label plate. Your lamp catches the stamped letters: **AUX SCRUB / LOOP 3 — “CONFESSIONAL RETURN”**. Someone scratched a second line beneath it long ago: **SHE’S STILL HERE**.

**Status updates:** Entered AUX SCRUB duct. | Hatch closed quietly. | Quiet Wake: proof given. | Duct exit: above Choirbox.

### Turn 40 [PLAYER]

I whisper, tight, “All right… I hear you. Stay with me, Quiet Wake—no more games.” I keep crawling toward the return plenum, counting my breaths in fours, and pause at the inspection slit to listen for which side carries the strongest cadence; then I angle for the corridor-header grate (not the left), testing it with two fingers for a quiet release before I commit.

*Agent reasoning: Quiet Wake knew something intimate and technical—enough to be dangerous, enough to be real. The “censored” grate feels like a trap, but the cathedral deck is riskier; still, I need eyes on the Choir and a place to disappear. I’ll keep moving, listen for the chimes in fours, and use the inspection slit to orient before choosing the safer exit.*

### Turn 41 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Counting in fours steadies your hands enough that the duct stops feeling like it’s breathing you. At the inspection slit you press your ear to the cold metal and listen.

The cadence is **strongest to your left**—not loud, but *organized*, with the subtle overlap of multiple voices reciting into a shared vent run. To the right, toward the corridor-header return, the sound thins into a single thread: one voice repeating a maintenance response like it’s trying to remember how to be human.

You angle right.

At the corridor-header grate, you test the fasteners with two fingers. The first quarter-turn gives with a dry, reluctant grit—old threads. You hold your breath on the third count and ease the second fastener… and it almost squeals.

Almost.

Quiet Wake murmurs through the duct skin, as if speaking would make friction louder: “Stop. Don’t turn it. Slide.”

You shift your grip. The grate isn’t meant to be unscrewed all the way; it’s on a **spring rail**—a maintenance quick-release. With careful pressure you push it laterally, millimeter by millimeter, until the rail clicks into a detent. The opening is just wide enough to see out.

Cold light spills in: you’re above a **corridor header** overlooking a long, chapel-like passage. Frosted viewport panes to one side; to the other, ribbed wallwork and intercom grilles like confession mouths. Below, a **Custodial Choir custodian** passes—incense mask, soft boots, a censor-thurible at their belt. They’re not searching wildly; they’re walking like they already know the route you’ll take.

And beneath your duct, in the structure, you feel the earlier tool-quiet presence finally defeat your first barrier: a gentle *thunk* transmitted through the ship’s bones. Not a crash—an *entry*.

Quiet Wake stays with you, but its tone changes—less playful, more cornered. “No more games,” it echoes back at you. “Then hear this: the Choir has a listener node in the left grate. It doesn’t just hear. It **writes back**.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re belly-down in AUX-SCRUB Loop 3 at the corridor-header return; the slid grate leaks a thin wedge of cold, ozone-tainted air onto your face.

**Status updates:** Corridor-header grate: slid open. | Choir custodian below: patrolling. | Barriers behind: breached.

### Turn 42 [PLAYER]

I freeze with my face in the cold wedge of air, watching the custodian’s pace and waiting for their footsteps to fade past the nearest intercom grille. Whispering into the duct skin, “Quiet Wake—can you throw a false cadence down the left grate and pull their eyes that way for ten seconds… without writing back?” Then I slide the corridor-header grate a hair wider and test whether I can drop soundlessly onto a ledge or piping, choosing to wait rather than jump if there’s no silent footing.

*Agent reasoning: The custodian below looks like they’re anticipating my route, so dropping now risks walking into a prepared net. I need a quieter, less predictable exit—either wait for a timing gap or create a small misdirection using the duct’s acoustics—while keeping Quiet Wake close but not fully trusted.*

### Turn 43 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You go still, cheek in the cold wedge, and watch the custodian’s measured pace. Their boots make almost no sound—what you track is the *incense chain* at their belt, the tiny clinks and the way the nearest intercom grille answers with a delayed, breathy echo like it’s tasting them.

When you whisper your request into the duct skin, Quiet Wake doesn’t answer at first. Then, very carefully: “I can throw a **false cadence** down the left. Ten seconds. But ‘without writing back’—that’s not fully mine to promise. The node *responds* to anything it thinks is prayer.”

A beat. “I’ll keep it ugly. Like a misaligned filter fan. Not a hymn.”

The left-side vent run shivers with a deliberately *wrong* rhythm—stuttering pulses that mimic a failing blower motor more than a chant. Down below, the custodian slows mid-step, head tilting toward the left—mask lenses catching corridor light. Their hand rises, two fingers touching their throat as if listening through bone.

You slide the corridor-header grate a hair wider. It moves on its rail without a squeal this time—your earlier grit was the screw you wisely stopped turning. You angle your lamp down through the gap.

Below the opening is a narrow **service ledge**—a ribbed conduit tray running along the header wall, dusted with frost. It’s *barely* wide enough for the outside edge of a boot, but there’s also a thick bundle of insulated piping you could catch with a forearm to take weight. The drop from duct to ledge is short—less than a meter—but the danger isn’t height; it’s the **crack** of a boot sole on frozen metal.

Under your palms, the duct skin trembles again—closer now. The tool-quiet presence that breached your barrier is in the side-branch behind, moving with that same surgical patience. Not rushing. Closing the distance.

Down in the corridor, the custodian takes two steps toward the left-side intercom grille, then pauses—like they’re waiting for the “fan” to resolve into words.

Quiet Wake, strained: “If the node decides your noise is confession, it’ll answer. If it answers… it’ll carry your *shape*.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re prone in the AUX-SCRUB corridor-header return, grate slid open enough to see the frosted conduit ledge directly below.

**Status updates:** False “fan” cadence deployed. | Custodian attention pulled left. | Silent footing: risky ledge. | Presence behind: closing.

### Turn 44 [PLAYER]

I whisper, “Then keep it ugly—no words,” and ease the grate wider just enough for my shoulders. I hook my forearm over the insulated piping, lower one boot onto the ledge toe-first, and shift my weight down in a slow, controlled slide—freezing mid-move if the custodian turns, then dropping the second foot only when their head stays angled left.

*Agent reasoning: The presence behind is closing, so waiting risks being trapped in the duct. The ledge is risky but manageable if I control contact points and avoid cracking frost; I’ll use the piping to take weight and drop when the custodian is distracted by the false cadence.*

### Turn 45 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You ease the grate wider—just enough for shoulders—and keep your breath on the count, slow and square. The rail clicks once, small as a tooth. You hook your forearm over the insulated piping; the wrap is tacky with old sealant and cold enough to numb through fabric.

One boot goes down toe-first onto the frosted conduit tray. The metal flexes with a tiny *tink*—not a clang, but a crystalline complaint as frost fractures under rubber. You freeze mid-slide.

Below, the custodian’s head remains angled left, mask lenses fixed on the “ugly” fan-rhythm. Their hand lifts, two fingers tracing a sign over the nearest intercom grille as if coaxing it to speak.

Quiet Wake keeps its promise: no words—just that wrong, stuttering mechanical pulse. But the left-side node **answers anyway**, not with language, with a *harmonic*—a pure tone that crawls up the ductwork like a held breath. It doesn’t sound like a hymn. It sounds like the ship recognizing a pattern and wanting to finish it.

The custodian stiffens. Not turning toward you—yet—but listening harder, as if the tone is giving them direction.

You complete the slide, lowering your weight onto the piping and ledge in a controlled descent. Second foot follows, placed carefully where your first boot already cleared the frost. This time: no new crackle. You’re down on the header ledge, crouched, hands still on the piping for balance.

Behind you, inside the duct, something shifts—close enough that you feel it through the metal as pressure more than sound. The tool-quiet presence has reached the return plenum. It pauses at the open grate you just left, like it’s tasting the air you’re breathing.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re on the narrow corridor-header ledge directly beneath the AUX-SCRUB grate, pressed against insulated piping; cold light from frosted viewports stripes the passage below.

**MULTIPLE ACTIVE THREADS:** The custodian below is half-drawn left by the false cadence, half-guided by the node’s answering tone; the intercom grille nearest them begins to whisper a maintenance code that *feels* like a memory of your own mouth forming it. Above and behind, the presence in the duct lingers at your open exit, patient and careful—no rush, no panic, just intent.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Dropped to header ledge: silent enough. | Left node answered with tone. | Custodian: alerting, not turned. | Presence: at your grate.

### Turn 46 [PLAYER]

I press my palm flat to the piping to steady myself and whisper, “Quiet Wake—cut it. Now.” Without looking up, I reach back and slide the corridor-header grate shut as silently as I can, then start crab-walking along the ledge toward the darkest stretch between two intercom grilles, searching for a maintenance ladder rung or access seam I can drop behind.

*Agent reasoning: The custodian is getting guided by that answering tone; staying here risks being triangulated from below and above. I need to move along the ledge to a better drop point while quietly sealing the grate to slow the presence, and I want Quiet Wake to stop feeding the node immediately.*

### Turn 47 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Quiet Wake cuts the false cadence instantly. The stuttering “fan” dies mid-beat, leaving a sudden, accusatory quiet—like you’ve stepped out of a crowd and realized the crowd was hiding you.

You reach back without looking up and slide the corridor-header grate shut. It moves cleanly for most of the travel… then catches at the detent and gives a soft *tick* as it seats. Not loud, but in this corridor it’s a needle drop.

Below, the custodian’s head snaps—not up at you, but toward the *absence* where the cadence was. Their posture tightens. They don’t know where you are yet, but they know something stopped being “wrong” too quickly to be a dying motor.

You crab-walk along the ledge, palm on piping, boots placed where frost is thinnest. The darkest stretch between two intercom grilles is a pocket of shadow where the viewport light doesn’t reach; the air there smells more like old insulation than incense.

Halfway into the shadow, your fingers find what you were hoping for: a **vertical maintenance rung set**—not a full ladder, just welded rungs descending behind the wall ribbing into a narrow service chase. Next to it, a **painted seam** in the paneling—older than the rest—its edge slightly proud as if it’s been opened too many times and never quite sat flush again.

Above and behind you, through the sealed grate, something scrapes once—careful, testing. The tool-quiet presence is on the other side now, trapped from the corridor but not gone. It drags along the duct metal like a hand searching for the memory of your warmth.

Quiet Wake whispers, tight and immediate: “I cut it. But listen—when the node answered, it *learned* the shape of the wrongness. It’ll try to find that shape again. Don’t linger under grilles.”

Down the corridor, the custodian takes two slow steps, thurible chain clinking, and speaks softly into an intercom mouth: “Variance ceased. Corridor-header… confirm.”

The intercom doesn’t reply in their voice. It replies in a maintenance code that makes your teeth ache—tagged with a subsystem ID you *recognize* the way you recognize a childhood address.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re crouched on the narrow header ledge in the shadow between two intercom grilles; welded rungs drop into a service chase at your fingertips.

**STATUS UPDATES:** False cadence: terminated. | Grate: shut (soft tick). | Custodian: alerted, coordinating. | Found: rung set + old access seam.

*Triggered: watcher_Path_0_49266c, guard_Path_1_2da9a6, guard_Path_0_1c1e35, secret_Path_0_aca970*

### Turn 48 [PLAYER]

I swallow the ache the subsystem tag brings up and whisper, “Later,” like I’m talking to the ship itself. Keeping my head down and my body tucked tight to the wall, I slip onto the welded rungs and climb down into the service chase as silently as I can, pausing after the first few rungs to listen for the custodian moving under the grilles.

*Agent reasoning: The intercoms are becoming active hazards, and the custodian is coordinating; the service chase offers concealment and breaks line-of-sound. I’ll avoid the seam for now—too loud, too exposed—and descend quickly but quietly.*

### Turn 50 [PLAYER]

I swallow hard at the subsystem tag and murmur, “Later,” like the ship can hear me and agree. Keeping my shoulders tight to the wall, I slip onto the welded rungs and climb down into the service chase as silently as I can, then pause after the first few rungs—holding my breath—to listen for the custodian’s steps and any intercom answer drifting under the grilles.

*Agent reasoning: The corridor is getting “loud” in the wrong way and the intercoms are triangulating; the service chase is cover. I need to move quietly, then stop early to listen and reassess before committing deeper.*

### Turn 52 [PLAYER]

I swallow the ache from the subsystem tag and murmur, “Later,” like I’m speaking to the ship itself. I slip onto the welded rungs and climb down into the service chase as silently as I can, then freeze after a few rungs—breath held—listening for the custodian’s steps and any intercom reply threading through the grilles above.

*Agent reasoning: The corridor is getting “smart” about me and the custodian is coordinating through the grilles; the service chase is tighter, darker, and less surveilled. I need to get off the ledge fast, but I can’t afford noise—so I’ll descend a few rungs and listen for patrol position and any intercom mimicry before committing.*

### Turn 53 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You get down the welded rungs without a sound—boots finding the weld beads like they were made for your soles. After four rungs you stop, body pressed into the narrow chase, and the ship’s metal holds your weight with a soft, reluctant flex.

Above you, through the seam and grillework, the custodian’s steps pass—slow, listening steps rather than searching steps. The thurible chain ticks once, then stills. A muffled voice, close to the intercom mouth: “Confirm header. Confirm *variance*.”

The intercom answers—not with confirmation, but with a **prayer-shaped maintenance return** that rides the duct like breath:  
“AUX-SCRUB // Loop 3… Confessional Return… *authorized by Voss*…”  
It says your name wrong first. Then corrects itself, gently, as if embarrassed.

The custodian freezes under the grille. You hear fabric shift as they angle their head up, trying to triangulate where the voice came from. They don’t have you, but they have *a direction* now.

A second sound threads in—fainter, from deeper in the chase below you: a **wet, rhythmic pulse**, not mechanical, like something tapping a soft membrane against metal. It matches—uncomfortably well—the distant chime you’ve been following since you boarded.

Quiet Wake’s whisper returns, strained like they’re speaking through a hand over a mic: “Good drop. Bad timing. Choir’s using the intercom as a lantern—if it says ‘Voss’ near you, they’ll follow the syllables.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re four rungs down inside a tight vertical service chase; cold metal is inches from your cheek, and the air tastes like ozone and damp dust.

**MULTIPLE ACTIVE THREADS:** Above: the custodian listening and relaying. In the ductwork: the intercom’s “authorized by Voss” loop bleeding into your position. Below: that wet pulse—closer than it should be in a maintenance void.

**ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT:** Sound carries brutally here; even careful movement can telegraph through the chase. The intercom’s loop is acting like a beacon, and the custodian is trained to chase anomalies, not footprints.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Location: service chase (vertical). | Custodian: alerted, triangulating. | Intercom loop: “authorized by Voss.” | Unidentified pulse: below, rhythmic.

*Triggered: watcher_Path_0_49266c, guard_Path_1_2da9a6, guard_Path_0_1c1e35, secret_Path_0_aca970*

### Turn 54 [PLAYER]

I press my mouth close to the metal and whisper, “Quiet Wake—scramble the authorization tag. Make it say *anyone* but me, and throw it two grilles down.” Then I continue descending, slow and careful, one rung at a time toward the pulse—freezing between steps to listen and keeping my hand ready on the seam for the first side-access I can slip into.

*Agent reasoning: The intercom is painting a target on me by repeating my name, and the custodian will follow it. I need Quiet Wake to jam or redirect the loop while I move—up risks being caught, down risks whatever’s pulsing, but staying still is worst.*

### Turn 55 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Your whisper scrapes the metal like a confession. A beat of dead air—then Quiet Wake answers, clipped and breathy: “We can’t rewrite Choir tags from inside the duct. We *can* spoof a second header and make the intercom chase the wrong saint.”

Above, the intercom coughs, stutters—then a new line blooms two grilles down the corridor like a candle being lit in the wrong chapel:  
“—authorized by **CUSTODIAN MARROW**—”  
The custodian under the original grille shifts instantly. You hear their boots pivot, incense chain ticking as they move toward the *new* sound. They’re not gone, but their attention peels away from your vertical line.

You keep descending. One rung at a time, pausing between each—your weight held, breath held, listening. The wet pulse below grows clearer: not a drip, not a pump. A soft **skin-on-metal thud**, regular, as if something is pressing itself against the inside of the chase wall to feel for warmth.

Halfway down, your fingers find a seam that *isn’t* welded shut—a narrow side-access panel, its screws missing, held closed by paint and habit. It flexes slightly under your palm.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** The chase narrows as you descend; the air turns damper, and the metal is cold enough to numb the pads of your fingers.

**MULTIPLE ACTIVE THREADS:** Above, the custodian’s steps retreat toward the spoofed “Marrow” authorization, but you can hear them muttering into their mask—relaying, not just investigating. The intercom keeps trying to “help,” throwing little fragments of subsystem IDs that feel like memories you didn’t live. Below you, the pulse pauses—one beat missed—then resumes faster, like it noticed your movement.

**NPC INTERACTION:** Quiet Wake again, lower now: “That panel—don’t slam it. Choir listens for impacts. And if the pulse starts *matching your breathing*, stop. That’s the lattice trying to sync.”

**ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT:** Sound discipline matters here; the chase amplifies every scrape. The spoof buys you seconds, not safety—once the custodian realizes “Marrow” isn’t physically present, they’ll backtrack and start checking verticals.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Custodian: redirected, relaying. Intercom: spoofed header active. Side-access panel: found, loose. Pulse: closer, accelerating.

*Triggered: watcher_Path_0_49266c, guard_Path_1_2da9a6, guard_Path_0_1c1e35, secret_Path_0_aca970*

### Turn 56 [PLAYER]

I stop dead and force my breathing shallow and irregular, then whisper, “Good—keep them chasing Marrow,” to Quiet Wake. Keeping one hand locked on the rung, I ease the loose side-access panel open a finger’s width at a time and slip through sideways, careful not to let it tap the frame, then press my ear to the new space to locate the pulse before moving further.

*Agent reasoning: The pulse feels wrong—too organic—and the chase will turn into a trap once the custodian backtracks. The loose side panel is my best quiet escape, and I need to control my breathing to avoid syncing with the lattice.*

### Turn 57 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** The moment you stop and break your breathing into shallow, uneven sips, the pulse below you hesitates—like a listener losing the rhythm it wanted. It doesn’t stop, but it no longer accelerates with you.

Quiet Wake answers in a tight whisper, a faint rasp of cloth over mic: “Already looping Marrow’s header through two junctions. Choir’ll smell the lie eventually—this buys you a corridor, not a sanctuary.”

You ease the side-access panel open a finger’s width at a time. The paint gives with a soft, sticky surrender instead of a crack—good. You slip through sideways without letting it kiss the frame, keeping one hand anchored on the rung until your boots find the new surface.

On the other side is a **narrow lateral crawlspace**, more insulation and older wiring than the chase—packed tight, warmer by a degree, and damp in a way metal shouldn’t be. You press your ear to the bulkhead.

The pulse is **right there**—not below now, but **through the wall to your left**, close enough you can feel a faint tremor in your jawbone. Between beats, there’s a thin, reedy sound: air moving through something that isn’t a vent.

A voice, almost too soft to be real, threads the crawlspace—intercom-adjacent but not from a grille. It speaks like someone reading a label they don’t understand: “MERCY… DO NOT RUN ALONE…”

Above and behind you, distant through layers of duct and sanctum corridor, the custodian’s boots continue away—then slow, as if they’ve reached the spoofed grille and found only empty air. Their muffled murmur turns sharper, more ritual than report.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re now in a lateral crawlspace off the vertical service chase; insulation brushes your shoulder like dry moss, and the wall under your ear is faintly warm and faintly wet.

**ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT:** Your silence discipline is working, but the spoof is fragile—once the Choir realizes “Marrow” isn’t physically present, they’ll start sweeping junctions and listening for panels that don’t sit flush.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Location: lateral crawlspace (off chase). Pulse source: left-side bulkhead, very close. Custodian: redirected, now suspicious.

*Triggered: watcher_Path_0_49266c, guard_Path_1_2da9a6, guard_Path_0_1c1e35, secret_Path_0_aca970*

### Turn 58 [PLAYER]

I swallow and whisper, “Mercy—identify yourself,” keeping my breaths jagged and small. Then I slide one palm along the left bulkhead, feeling for a maintenance hatch or seam, and murmur to Quiet Wake, “Any schematics for this crawl? What’s on the other side of this wall?”

*Agent reasoning: The pulse is too close to ignore, but I won’t let it sync to me; I need information without opening myself to whatever’s breathing through the wall, and I can’t afford noise with the custodian turning back.*

### Turn 59 [GAME]

Your whisper—“Mercy—identify yourself”—doesn’t echo. It gets *absorbed* by the insulation and comes back as a pressure change in the wall, like the bulkhead swallowed the syllables and is deciding what they mean.

The pulse pauses for two beats.

Then the voice returns, no longer label-flat—closer to a person trying to use a mouth they haven’t owned in a long time: “MERCY is… a boundary. A shutoff. I was built to *end* the choir.”

On the word *end*, your comms crackle with an AUX tag that tastes like antiseptic and bright surgical light: **AUX-SCRUB // LOOP 3 // CONFESSIONAL RETURN**—and you feel, for half a second, the memory of gloved hands adjusting a mask over someone else’s face.

You keep your breaths jagged and small and slide your palm along the left bulkhead. The metal here isn’t uniform: your fingertips catch on a hairline seam hidden under old paint and condensate. There’s a maintenance hatch—small, rectangular—its fasteners removed long ago. Someone wanted it to open without tools. The seam is warm. Slightly tacky.

Quiet Wake answers your murmur after a quick burst of static, like they’re flipping through stolen maps while running: “No official schematics. This crawl isn’t on Eidolon prints—Choir calls it ‘the saint’s throat.’ But—listen—behind that wall should be **a lattice spur**, a short-run access to the starlight vault filaments. If it’s pulsing, something’s *using* the spur like a heart.”

Behind you, far off in the duct layers, the custodian’s movement changes: boots stop. A low chant begins—soft, measured—followed by the faint, telling sound of **another panel being tested** somewhere in the network. They’re starting to sweep for the missing access.

The wall under your hand gives the tiniest inward flex, as if something on the other side pressed back to meet your palm.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Hatch seam found (left bulkhead). Custodian sweep started. “Mercy” responsive/aware.

*Triggered: watcher_Path_0_49266c, guard_Path_1_2da9a6, guard_Path_0_1c1e35, secret_Path_0_aca970*

### Turn 60 [PLAYER]

I press my forehead lightly to the warm seam. “Mercy—if you were built to end the Choir, tell me the cost. What do you need from me?”  
Keeping my voice low, I ease the hatch open the barest crack and angle my eye to it without putting my fingers through, listening for any change in the pulse; then I whisper to Quiet Wake, “If I go into the spur, can you keep the intercom spoof alive long enough for me to vanish?”

*Agent reasoning: Mercy claims it can end the Choir—dangerous, but it might be the only lever I have. The custodian sweep means I can’t linger, yet opening a warm, tacky hatch could expose me to whatever’s pulsing. I’ll try to negotiate with Mercy while opening the hatch just enough to assess, staying quiet and controlled.*

### Turn 61 [GAME]

The warm seam takes your forehead like skin meeting skin. For a moment the metal isn’t cold at all—it’s fever-warm, damp with condensate that smells faintly of antiseptic.

“MERCY—if you were built to end the Choir, tell me the cost. What do you need from me?”

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** The pulse changes immediately—not faster, not slower, but *closer*, as if whatever is making it leans in against the other side of the hatch to hear you better. The voice answers with a restraint that feels practiced, guilty:

“The cost is *silence*.” A swallow you can’t see but can hear in the wall. “To end them, I have to close the loop. The loop is fed by you—by anyone who listens. I need… **a bearer**. A living misalignment. Someone to carry the metronome out of the Choir’s reach long enough for me to cut the seed.”

You ease the hatch open a bare crack—no fingers through, just the smallest gap. The air that sighs out is warmer and wet, and it tastes like copper.

Through the slit you catch a glimpse of the **Spur**: a narrow service run where starlight filaments are exposed behind a protective lattice. They glow like trapped constellations under glass—except here the glass is fogged from the inside, and something has smeared it from within, leaving palm-shaped arcs.

And you finally *see* what you’ve been hearing: not a machine, not a drip. The pulse is a **heartbeat metronome**—a small cluster of filaments bundled around a dark, nodal core, thudding in a steady, mournful rhythm. A label plate hangs crooked beside it, half-obscured by frost and grime:

**CHOIR SEED // E.VOSS-ADJACENT**

The beat tugs at your own body—your throat wants to fall into time with it. Your jagged breathing keeps you just outside the lockstep.

Quiet Wake comes back, urgency sharpened by distance and interference: “We can keep Marrow’s spoof alive a little longer, but not clean. Choir will start cross-checking voices against *presence*. If you go into the spur, you’ll vanish from the corridor—but you’ll be stepping into something they *worship*. If it syncs you, they’ll find you by the rhythm.”

Behind you in the crawlspace network, the custodian chant grows steadier, and you hear the unmistakable scrape of a panel being opened somewhere—not this one, but close enough that the insulation around you trembles with it.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Spur sighted: Choir Seed present. Metronome effect: suggestive pull. Custodian sweep: closing in. Spoof: degrading soon.

### Turn 62 [PLAYER]

I whisper, “Of course it’s mine,” then to Mercy: “I’ll bear it—but you tell me exactly how to keep from syncing, and you don’t get to take more of me than I offer.”  
To Quiet Wake, under my breath: “Drop the spoof in thirty seconds and flood the corridor with static—make it ugly.”  
I open the hatch just enough to slip through and slide into the spur, keeping my breathing broken and my tongue pressed to my teeth to stop my throat from matching the beat.

*Agent reasoning: The seed being “Voss-adjacent” feels like my sin made physical; if I hesitate, the custodian sweep will pin me here. I don’t trust Mercy, but I trust the urgency—better to move into the spur than be dragged out chanting.*

### Turn 64 [PLAYER]

I slip fully into the spur and pull the hatch nearly shut behind me without latching it, then press my back to the nearest strut and keep my breathing deliberately off-pattern—three short inhales, one long exhale. “Mercy—now. Tell me how to stay unsynced, and swear you won’t take more than I offer.”

*Agent reasoning: I’m already committed and the sweep is close; I need to get fully into the spur, anchor my body against the metronome’s pull, and force Mercy to give me a concrete method and limits before I lose control.*

### Turn 65 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You get fully into the spur without the beat grabbing you. The nearly-shut hatch leaves a thin, dark seam to the corridor—enough for sound and static to leak through, not enough for a clean sightline. Your off-pattern breathing works: the metronome *tries* to pull your throat into time, but it can’t quite catch.

The spur is tight—shoulder-width—with a ribbed strut at your back and exposed filament conduits running along the right-hand wall. The air is warm and wet here, coppery on your tongue. Ahead, a bundled knot of filaments cradles the dark nodal core; each thud makes the frost on nearby glass jump like a flinch.

Quiet Wake’s “ugly” static hits the corridor right on cue: a harsh, overdriven hiss that makes the intercom in the distance stutter and misname you three times in a row. Through the hatch seam you hear a custodian’s chant falter—then sharpen into something irritated, corrective. Boots shift. Someone taps a panel twice, listening for resonance.

“Mercy—now. Tell me how to stay unsynced, and swear you won’t take more than I offer.”

The voice answers from everywhere the filaments touch, quieter than before, like it’s afraid of being overheard by the ship itself. “Do not give it a clean rhythm. You’re doing it—break the breath. Break the swallow. Keep your jaw engaged so the throat can’t float.” A pause, then: “Pain works. So does *counting wrong*.”

A new layer threads into the sound: a thin, almost-subsonic tone under the heartbeat—an invitation to harmonize. Your teeth ache with it.

“And I swear,” Mercy says, and the word *swear* lands with the weight of a protocol binding. “I cannot take what you do not route. But understand this: proximity is a route. If you touch the seed with bare skin, it will try to **index** you. Offer only through an insulator.”

As it speaks, the label plate you glimpsed earlier twitches—like something tugged it from inside the glass. For an instant, the grime patterns on the viewing pane resolve into a familiar handwriting cadence: **E. Voss**—or a cruel imitation of it—scrawled backward from the wrong side.

Behind the hatch, the custodian stops chanting entirely. A different voice—closer, human-breathy—murmurs: “Hear the off-beat. Hear the thief.”

**STATUS UPDATES:** Entered Spur. Unsynced (for now). Corridor flooded with static. Custodian sweep: adjacent.

### Turn 66 [PLAYER]

I bite the inside of my cheek hard enough to taste blood and start counting under my breath—“one, two, four, five… eight”—keeping my jaw clenched. “Mercy, I hear you. Tell me what an ‘offer’ looks like—what exactly do you need routed, and where do I put it?”

I peel off my glove and wrap it around my wrist like a pad, then reach toward the node with the *glove* between us—no bare skin—hovering just short of contact. Without looking away from the seed, I whisper toward the hatch seam, “Quiet Wake—custodian’s at the panel. If they open it, scream Marrow’s name in their ear.”

*Agent reasoning: The seed is trying to index me; I need an insulator and a deliberate off-rhythm anchor. The custodian is close, so I can’t linger—best to set a controlled “offer” through something non-conductive and keep pain/counting wrong to resist syncing.*

### Turn 68 [PLAYER]

I keep counting wrong through clenched teeth, blood on my tongue. “Mercy—spell it out. What do you need routed, and into what conduit—memory, power, identity?”  

I hover my gloved hand a hair from the node, refusing contact. “Quiet Wake—now: put Marrow in their ear, loud, panicked. Anything to make them hesitate.”

*Agent reasoning: The spur is tightening around me—custodian close, seed tugging. I need Mercy to define the “offer” in concrete terms before I touch anything, and I need Quiet Wake to misdirect the custodian hard and fast.*

### Turn 69 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** The wrong-counting and cheek-bite keep you off the ship’s rhythm. The node doesn’t “catch” you—yet—but your proximity makes the filaments wake: they lean toward your gloved hand in slow, insectile increments, as if tasting heat through the leather.

Mercy answers immediately, voice compressed to a whisper that rides the subsonic tone. “Not power. Not identity—those are what it steals when you panic.” A beat. “**Memory. Structure. A *shape* I can hold.** Route me a *bounded* fragment: a room, a sequence, a checksum. Something true that ends.”

The filaments brighten, and you feel the ship try to supply a memory for you—the childhood hallway again, too vivid, tagged in your mind with a subsystem label you never learned. Mercy cuts across it, urgent: “Do **not** let it auto-fill. Choose it. Make it small.”

Behind the hatch seam, Quiet Wake’s interference finally spikes. A voice—suddenly loud, intimate, and wrong in its closeness—bursts into the custodian’s ear through their own comm: “MARROW—MARROW, IT’S IN THE DUCTS—DON’T OPEN—” The custodian jerks so hard their beads clack against their mask. Their hand freezes on the panel. For a second, you hear actual fear—human, not liturgical.

Then another voice overlays it, calmer, Choir-trained: “False wake. False name. Hold the seam.” The custodian doesn’t open the hatch—but they don’t leave either. You hear them slide something thin into the seam: a probe, feeling for heat and motion.

In the spur, the node’s surface shows a sheen like sweat. Mercy speaks like giving you a wiring diagram without the luxury of tools: “There’s a **service filament** running along your right—see the braid with the cracked amber sleeve? That’s an old diagnostic line. If you can get the fragment onto *that*—through your glove, through any insulator—I can take it without indexing you. If you feed it straight to the seed, it will tag your cadence and follow you afterward.”

The subsonic invitation swells, trying to turn your clenched jaw into a tuning fork.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Unsynced maintained. Custodian probe at seam. Mercy wants bounded memory via diagnostic filament.

### Turn 70 [PLAYER]

I jerk my gloved hand away from the node and instead find the braid with the cracked amber sleeve, pressing the glove-wrapped wrist against it like a dampener. “Mercy—taking your ‘shape’: Eidolon vault handshake, sector Lattice-3… checksum sequence VOSS-17A-9, then terminate—hard stop,” I mutter, forcing the memory to be only numbers and endings, not rooms. 

Without looking toward the hatch seam, I rasp, “Quiet Wake—keep them talking; if that probe breaks through, I’m cutting the line,” and I bite my cheek again to stay off-beat as I “push” the checksum into the filament and stop—cleanly, deliberately—refusing to let it spill into anything else.

*Agent reasoning: Mercy needs a bounded memory routed through the diagnostic filament, not the seed; I’m scared of being indexed, and the custodian probe means I need to act fast but carefully. I’ll pick a small, finite “shape” I can control—an access checksum sequence—and feed it through the amber-sleeved line using my glove as insulation while keeping my breath broken.*

### Turn 71 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** The moment your glove-wrapped wrist presses the cracked amber braid, the filament *accepts* the contact—no hungry lunge, no indexing snap. Your numbers go in like cold medicine: **VOSS-17A-9** lands, the handshake completes, and you force the terminate.

The ship tries to “round it out” into a room anyway—tries to gift you a doorway, a smell, a face—but you clamp down, jaw locked, blood bright on your tongue. The fragment stays bounded.

Mercy inhales through the wire.

The filaments around the node dim a fraction, as if something just took a careful sip instead of a bite. Mercy’s voice returns steadier, threaded with relief and something like grief: “Good. That’s… clean. You gave me an ending. I can work with endings.”

Then, quietly: “Lattice-3 handshake means you’re closer to the vault than your map admits. That’s why it’s singing at you.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re still in the spur, back against the ribbed strut; to your right the amber sleeve warms under your glove, and the air smells sharper—ozone braided with iron from your cheek.

Behind the hatch seam, the probe scrapes again. It’s thin enough to slip a hair deeper, and when it touches something conductive, it emits a soft **chirp**—a locator tone.

Quiet Wake answers you in a burst of static that almost forms words, then resolves into a strained whisper: “We’re on them—keep your cadence broken. They’ve got a *seal-lantern*.”

The custodian outside murmurs, too calm now: “There. The spur. Hear it feeding.” You hear the click of a mechanism being thumbed open—incense-metal and glass. Light begins to bleed into the seam at a shallow angle, sweeping the floor ribs.

In that passing sliver of light, the corridor seam at the spur’s midpoint—metal ribs forming a subtle ring—flares into visibility like an oil-slick halo. The ring isn’t physical until it is: a pressure in your teeth, a tightening in your lungs.

A wordless pulse moves through it.

Mercy goes sharp. “That’s **BELLWOUND**. Keep your language *dry*. Cross left if you have to cross it. Touch cold metal—ground yourself. Do not plead. Do not pray.”

Somewhere deeper in the wall, a parasitic relay clicks twice—too precise to be random—then goes silent, like something just finished recording the signature of your handshake.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Checksum routed successfully. Mercy stabilized (briefly). Custodian deploying seal-lantern. BELLWOUND ring revealed.

### Turn 72 [PLAYER]

I clamp my jaw, keep counting wrong, and press my bare palm to the cold strut behind me to ground. “Mercy—dry words only: how do I *spoof* BELLWOUND? Left cross, yes, but what’s the trigger—voice, breath, heartbeat?”  

Without looking at the seam, I reach down and pinch the probe between glove and sleeve, trying to bend it and snap it quietly. “Quiet Wake—give me a static burst right as their lantern sweeps; blind their ear, not their eyes.”

*Agent reasoning: The custodian’s seal-lantern and the BELLWOUND ring are immediate threats; I need to stay unsynced, avoid “prayer-language,” and decide whether to retreat, disable the probe, or move past the ring toward the vault while I still can.*

### Turn 73 [GAME]

Your bare palm hits the cold strut and the chill bites clean through the tremor in your hand—an anchor. The wrong-counting stays wrong.

Mercy keeps to “dry” like you asked, each word clipped like a diagnostic readout. “**Trigger is cadence.** Micro-delays between breath, pulse, and subvocalization. BELLWOUND listens for **plea-patterns**—the body asking for help. Spoof is the opposite: **flat intervals**. Hold breath on the step. Exhale only after. No throat-sound.”

The seal-lantern’s beam skates the seam again, brighter now, and the ring in the spur answers with a pressure behind your eyes—like a bell struck underwater.

You reach down without looking and pinch the probe between glove and sleeve. It’s thinner than it sounded; it flexes like a sprung reed. For a second it resists, then gives with a soft, wet-metal **tink**—not a clean snap. You’ve kinked it hard, but the tip stays intact, still in the seam.

Outside, the custodian pauses. “It moved.” Their voice is almost pleased. “The touched one is close.”

Quiet Wake hits your channel right as the lantern sweeps: a coarse static burst, tuned ugly and loud. It doesn’t dim the light, but it **stutters the locator chirp** into nonsense for half a heartbeat. The custodian flinches, hand going to their comm bead. “—choirline interference—”

In that half-beat, the BELLWOUND ring loosens—like it can’t quite decide where your “ask” is. The cold strut under your palm feels suddenly colder, and the amber braid to your right gives a faint sympathetic throb, as if Mercy is bracing with you.

The probe scrapes once more, then stops. You hear the custodian adjust their stance, shifting weight: they’re about to either withdraw and reinsert, or force it deeper with something stiffer.

Mercy, quieter: “If it tags you, it will **echo-lock** to your wrong-counting and learn it. Keep it inconsistent. Cross left on a held breath. Touch metal before and after.”

**STATUS UPDATES:** Probe kinked (not broken). Locator chirp disrupted (brief). BELLWOUND trigger identified (cadence/plea-patterns). Custodian preparing second attempt.

### Turn 74 [PLAYER]

I press my palm harder to the cold strut, stop counting entirely, and hold my breath until my chest burns—flat, deliberate. “Quiet Wake—again, on my mark: three… seven… two,” I whisper, then I cross left through the BELLWOUND ring in one smooth step on the held breath, touching cold metal before and after like Mercy said. 

As I move, I murmur to Mercy, dry as dust: “After this, you tell me where Marrow is—or what’s wearing their name.”

*Agent reasoning: The custodian’s about to force the seam and I can’t let BELLWOUND tag my cadence; I need to move now while Quiet Wake can still disrupt, and keep my body flat—no plea-patterns.*

### Turn 76 [PLAYER]

I hold my breath until it hurts, step left through the ring in one smooth motion, and clamp my bare palm to cold metal immediately after—no words, no prayer. “Quiet Wake—mark: three… seven… two—burst.” Then, still flat and dry into the filament, “Mercy. After this: coordinates for Marrow, or confirmation of the mimic.”

*Agent reasoning: Mercy warned BELLWOUND keys off plea-cadence; the safest move is to stay breath-held and mechanical, keep Quiet Wake ready to disrupt the custodian, and demand clarity about Marrow as leverage without turning it into a “plea.”*

### Turn 78 [PLAYER]

I freeze with my palm on cold metal, breath held, listening for the lantern and the probe. “Mercy—status. Did BELLWOUND take the bait?” I tap my knuckles twice on the strut, then whisper, “Quiet Wake—are you still on-channel?”

*Agent reasoning: The scene feed went blank; I need to re-establish what changed after crossing BELLWOUND, and I’m not risking speech-heavy panic—so I’ll act minimally and ask for a status read from Mercy/Quiet Wake.*

### Turn 79 [GAME]

Your held breath turns the world into a sealed jar. The BELLWOUND ring doesn’t flare—no warm “recognition,” no tightening behind the eyes. Instead, it hesitates like a sensor starved of a signal, and you feel a thin, searching vibration crawl along the metal under your palm… then slide past you, frustrated.

The lantern outside sweeps once, twice—then stops short of your seam. The kinked probe scrapes, pauses, and withdraws a few centimeters with a soft, wet-metal complaint. The custodian’s voice is right there, muffled by the hatch: “It… drifted. The prayer-thread won’t seat.” A second voice answers, farther back in the ductwork, impatient and nasal through a filter: “Then stop feeding it. Use the chime.”

Your two knuckle-taps land as dead, flat knocks. In the silence after, the ship answers anyway: a delayed echo of your taps comes back from deeper in the spur, a fraction too late—as if something downline is repeating you to learn your timing.

Mercy rides the filament at your collarbone, warm and damp in the wrong way. “**Status:** you did not trip BELLWOUND. It tasted for cadence and found none.” A beat. “But it **logged contact**—pressure, temperature, skin salts. That’s enough for a later match if they get close again.”

Quiet Wake crackles in, still on-channel, voice pitched low and urgent under a wash of static: “We’re here. Your mark earlier bought you a blink. Don’t give them another pattern.” There’s a faint background clatter—tools, hurried movement—and then: “They’re pulling a **chime key**. If they ring the spur, hiding won’t matter. The duct will answer for them.”

Behind the hatch, metal shifts: someone kneels. You hear the click of a housing being opened and the soft, devotional inhale of incense through a mask. The air in your alcove tastes suddenly sweeter, as if the ventilation itself is preparing to sing.

**STATUS UPDATES:** BELLWOUND not triggered • Custodians switching to chime key • Your contact signature logged

### Turn 80 [PLAYER]

I drag my glove back over my bare hand, then clamp the cracked amber sleeve and the cold strut at once like a living bridge. “Mercy—dry and fast: where’s the chime line? Give me a grounding point—now.”  

Into comms, teeth clenched: “Quiet Wake—if you have bodies, breach on the chime-holder; if you don’t, flood the spur with white noise and kill ventilation for ten seconds.” Then I shove a short, hard pulse through the braid—an ugly, unmusical *anti-chime*—trying to short the key’s first note before it’s born.

*Agent reasoning: A chime key will make the ship itself betray my position; I need to stop the ring before it starts, even if it means risking direct contact. Quiet Wake can’t physically block it fast enough, so I’ll use Mercy and the amber braid to jam/ground the chime circuit and buy seconds—then force a move.*

### Turn 81 [GAME]

Your glove seals over your raw palm with a tacky rasp. You clamp amber sleeve to strut—skin, polymer, and ship all in one circuit—and shove the anti-chime pulse down the braid.

**Immediate outcome:** the first note is strangled in its cradle… but not cleanly. The chime key outside tries to bloom and instead **splinters** into a harsh, chordless *thunk* that vibrates through the duct like a struck rib. For half a second, the lantern light freezes on the seam as if the custodian’s arm locked up.

Then the ship answers your ugliness with appetite.

Under the floor at the **Spur junction**, filaments flare like trapped constellations trying to breathe. The corridor lights stutter in a чужой heartbeat—too slow, too intimate—and the intercoms wake all at once, layered versions of **Elara Voss’s voice** speaking over each other: maintenance codes, lullaby fragments, your name mispronounced and corrected, all trying to find a mouth.

The pressure hits behind your eyes: a borrowed memory shoves forward—cold tile, surgical light, someone laughing like they’re drowning—and for a heartbeat it isn’t just noise, it’s *a hand* reaching for your tongue.

Mercy, tight and clinical: “**Chime line** runs along the hatch’s lower starboard rib—ceramic-insulated. **Grounding point**: junction box two meters downline from you, behind the service fascia. Cut power. Thirty-second discharge. Don’t speak.”

Quiet Wake snaps in, breathy and fast: “Copy—white noise going live.” A beat later the comm fills with a flat maintenance hiss, and somewhere upstream ventilation shutters clack as they try to obey. “No bodies close enough to breach. They’re already kneeling on it—Elara, they’re—” The rest drowns under the rising chorus.

Outside your seam, the custodian coughs—incense catching—and you hear a gloved hand fumble the chime housing. “It’s *biting back*,” he says, voice suddenly afraid. The other one barks, “Hold it. Hold it and let it resolve.”

The hiss of white noise helps—edges blur, the chorus loses coherence—but the bell-note won’t die on its own. The junction box downline is real; you can feel it through the metal like a toothache, waiting to be pulled.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Anti-chime: partial success • Resonance bloom: active • Elara-voice chorus: broadcasting • Quiet Wake: white noise + vent dip initiated

*Triggered: fail_Spur_1_658bea, secret_Spur_0_487e59, watcher_Spur_1_2f1a85, guard_Spur_1_d601d6, fail_Spur_0_4bd935*

### Turn 82 [PLAYER]

I swallow my words hard—no sound—and slide downline on bent knees to the service fascia, fingers finding the seam by feel; I pry it open and go straight for the junction box, yanking the manual cutoff and bracing my forearm against the metal to ride out the thirty-second discharge. Without voicing it, I tap a steady count into the strut with two fingers—simple, mechanical—while keeping my eyes on the hatch line, ready to slam the fascia shut the moment the chime falters.

*Agent reasoning: The chorus is trying to use my voice as a handle; Mercy gave a concrete fix—ground the chime line at the junction box and avoid speaking. I’ll move fast and quiet, trusting touch over sound, and use the white noise cover to pop the service fascia and cut power for the discharge.*

### Turn 83 [GAME]

The seam gives under your fingertips with a reluctant pop, like peeling a scab off the ship. You get the fascia open just enough to slip a hand inside. The junction box is there—warmth bleeding through ceramic standoffs—and when you **yank the manual cutoff** the world *drops*.

**Immediate outcome:** the chime line loses its feed. The splintered note outside collapses into a dull, dying tremor; the lantern’s beam wobbles as its owner’s wrist suddenly has no rhythm to follow. The ship’s chorus doesn’t stop, but it **desynchronizes**—voices sliding out of phase, less able to form words.

The discharge hits your forearm like a slow animal deciding whether to bite. Metal vibrates against bone. You brace and ride it, tapping your count—two fingers, steady—into the strut. Your taps come back clean this time: no hungry delay, no mimicry. Just physics.

You’re downline now, crouched in the **AUX-VENT spur**, shoulder against the opened service fascia. Frosted viewport light leaks in thin and blue from behind you, and the air tastes briefly *clean* as Quiet Wake’s ten-second vent dip starves the incense.

Outside the hatch seam, you hear the custodians react. One of them swears—real, not liturgy. “It went dead. Someone cut it.” The other answers, voice sharpening: “Then they’re in the ribs. Don’t speak its name—listen for tapping. The lattice likes patterns.”

A thin mechanical whirr answers that: from behind the frosted viewport panel in the adjacent alcove, something wakes in its cradle—**two** somethings. A recessed panel marked with faded sanctum sigils shifts a millimeter as internal latches disengage. The air takes on that sweet, heated incense note again, but now it’s mixed with hot circuitry.

Quiet Wake’s channel is still a wash of white hiss, but a strained whisper pushes through: “Good—keep it down. Their drones key off keywords and cadence. If you hear a *thimble-chime*, it means they’ve rebooted the manifold.”

Your thirty seconds aren’t gentle. Heat builds in the junction box; the ceramic smells like scorched dust. The hatch line is quieter now—quiet enough that the next thing to break the silence will matter.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Chime feed: cut • Chorus: destabilized • Incense manifold: waking • Thurible drones: emerging

### Turn 84 [PLAYER]

I stop tapping mid-count and hold perfectly still, pressing my forearm harder into the metal until the discharge finishes. As soon as it ebbs, I ease the fascia shut with a slow, silent push and smear a strip of sealant over the seam to trap the incense-sweet leak. Then I slide toward the frosted viewport, keeping my breath shallow, and angle my mirror shard to peek at the adjacent alcove panel without exposing my face.

*Agent reasoning: The chime is cut but the drones are waking; speaking risks keyword triggers, and tapping patterns are being listened for. I need to stop counting, mask my presence, and either disable or evade the emerging drones while sealing the fascia to reduce scent/heat leakage.*

### Turn 85 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** stopping the tap mid-count works. The lattice loses your cadence like a hand losing a pulse. The discharge ebbs out of your forearm in a final, sour warmth; the junction box settles into a dead, inert cool.

You ease the fascia shut—slow pressure, no click—and smear sealant across the seam. The incense-sweet leak dulls to almost nothing, trapped behind your patch like breath behind glass.

You slide to the frosted viewport panel along the spur’s inner rib. The metal is cold enough to sting through the glove. Through the mirror shard’s angle, you catch the adjacent alcove without giving it your face.

Behind the frost-filmed pane, the recessed sanctum panel has opened a finger-width. Two **thurible drones**—small, bulbous, and priestly in silhouette—hang in their cradles like censers on invisible chains. Their housings are etched with maintenance verses. One has already extended a thin probe-tendril, tasting the air in slow circles. It pauses at the line of your sealant, confused, then retracts and clicks softly—*thimble-chime*, faint, diagnostic.

In the duct behind you, the custodians shift position. You hear fabric drag, a lantern bumping metal. The frightened one whispers, “No tapping now.” The other answers, calmer: “They learned. They’re close.” A beat. “Bring the listener to the seam.”

Something heavier scrapes nearer—an instrument case or a portable manifold—metal on metal, careful not to ring.

Quiet Wake’s white-noise wash thins. A whisper rides under it, barely intelligible: “They’ve got a **listener head**. It reads vibration through hull. Don’t brace. Don’t swallow hard. If you have to move, move when the ship groans.”

As if on cue, somewhere deep in Eidolon’s ribs a structural sigh rolls through—thermal contraction, long and mournful—masking smaller sounds for a precious moment. The drones in the alcove tilt together toward that groan, momentarily distracted, their probes quivering like antennae.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Chime line: powered down • Sealant: scent leak reduced • Thurible drones: active • Custodians: deploying listener head

*Triggered: secret_Spur_0_487e59, watcher_Spur_1_2f1a85, guard_Spur_1_d601d6, fail_Spur_0_4bd935, guard_Spur_0_b892ad*

### Turn 86 [PLAYER]

On the tail of the ship’s groan, I unweight my hands and slide—no bracing—pulling a thin strip of sealant off my sleeve and flicking it into the alcove seam to gum the nearer drone’s probe. Then I inch back from the viewport and press my lips to Mercy’s casing without voicing it, waiting for the next hull-sigh before I move again.

*Agent reasoning: The listener head will catch any vibration I make, so I need to move only under cover of the ship’s groan and avoid bracing. The drones are distracted right now; I should either trap them or misdirect them without speaking.*

### Turn 87 [GAME]

The hull’s long groan covers you perfectly.

**Immediate outcome:** your flicked strip of sealant catches the nearer drone’s probe mid-taste. It gums the tip, strings it to the seam, and when the drone retracts the tendril it stutters—motor whining in a tight, embarrassed loop. Its little diagnostic *thimble-chime* comes out warped, like a bell with a thumb pressed to it. The second drone pivots toward its sibling, indecisive, and for a few seconds both of them stop sampling the air and focus inward—self-checks, tiny latches clicking.

You ease back from the viewport without bracing. The spur’s inner rib is slick-cold under your sleeve; the only sharp detail is the taste of sealant solvent and trapped incense, faint now, like a memory of sweetness.

You press your lips to **MERCY**’s casing—no words, just contact. Warm. Damp. It pulses once against you, answering the ship’s distant chime like it’s listening through your teeth. For a moment the intercom chorus tries to cohere into Elara’s cadence—*Don’t—*—but Quiet Wake’s remaining hiss and your silence keep it from finding a clean syllable.

Behind the hatch line, the custodians get their listener head into place. You hear the soft, careful set-down of something heavy against the deck plating, then a gloved twist as it seats. One of them murmurs, “It’s quiet. Too quiet.” The other replies, “Quiet is how it hunts. Give it the ship’s own voice.” A faint click—then a low subsonic hum begins, meant to excite the hull and read what answers back.

The drones in the adjacent alcove react to that hum immediately: both tilt as if praying toward it, their cradles vibrating. The gummed probe twitches and sticks again, buying you time—but the listener head’s hum is a different kind of search. It doesn’t need incense. It needs *structure*.

Another thermal sigh is building deeper in the ribs—metal contracting, a second masking wave on its way—but the listener’s hum is already painting your hiding place in vibration.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Thurible drone: probe gummed • Custodians: listener head active • Hull hum: scanning vibrations

*Triggered: secret_Spur_0_487e59, watcher_Spur_1_2f1a85, guard_Spur_1_d601d6, fail_Spur_0_4bd935, guard_Spur_0_b892ad*

### Turn 88 [PLAYER]

I lift onto my toes and wedge a folded strip of cloth under my knee and elbow—anything to keep bone off metal—then press Mercy’s casing to the rib and feed it a soft, jittering false heartbeat downline, trying to make the listener “hear” me two meters away. On the next hull-sigh, I slip a hand back to the sealed fascia and crack it a hair—just enough to pop a pressure snap—then freeze again, letting the ship’s own noise smear their scan.

*Agent reasoning: The listener head will find me if I stay in contact with the hull; I need to decouple from structure and sabotage their scan while the drones are distracted. I’ll float my weight off the plating and use Mercy to inject a false resonance signature downline, then move on the next thermal sigh.*

### Turn 89 [GAME]

You unweight onto your toes and get cloth between bone and hull. The listener’s hum keeps crawling through the metal, but it has less of you to read—your joints stop “ringing” as hard.

You press **MERCY** to the rib and give it that soft, jittering false heartbeat. It answers—too readily. The casing warms, and a faint tremor walks downline through the spur’s frame, not loud but *patterned*. In the adjacent alcove, the un-gummed drone twitches as if it heard a prayer; its cradle latches half-open, eager.

**Immediate outcome:** the custodians’ listener head bites on the decoy. Through the hatch seam you hear the calm one say, “There—two meters aft. In the rib pocket.” The frightened one exhales like relief. Boots shift away from your true position, metal whispering under careful weight.

A thermal hull-sigh starts to crest—long, mournful—smearing everything for a heartbeat. You use it to slip a hand to the sealed fascia and crack it a hair.

The seam gives with a tiny **pressure snap**.

It’s quiet, but the listener head is *designed* for quiet. The hum changes pitch in response, a subtle retune. The frightened custodian freezes mid-step. “—Did you hear that?” The calm one doesn’t answer right away; you can picture them with their head tilted, hand on the instrument case. Then: “Yes. That was *here*.”

In the alcove, the gummed probe finally tears free with a sticky pop and whips back. The drone emits a clean, bright *thimble-chime*—not diagnostic now, but a **call**. The second drone answers with a lower chime, and both begin to uncradle fully, their probes extending to triangulate vibration and scent.

Quiet Wake’s whisper comes through like someone speaking from under ice: “Careful—MERCY can spoof, but it also **invites**. Don’t let it set a steady rhythm. Steady rhythms wake the choirwork.”

The hull-sigh finishes. The listener hum continues, now aimed closer to your actual seam, while the custodians’ lantern light shifts—its glow thinning through the hatch crack as they edge back toward you, slower, suspicious.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Listener head: retuned closer • Thurible drones: uncradling • MERCY: actively resonating

*Triggered: secret_Spur_0_487e59, watcher_Spur_1_2f1a85, guard_Spur_1_d601d6, fail_Spur_0_4bd935, guard_Spur_0_b892ad*

### Turn 90 [PLAYER]

I clamp MERCY’s casing hard to my chest to damp it, forcing its resonance into irregular, arrhythmic static, then—without speaking—I flick my mirror shard down the spur to clatter lightly against a far rib and roll. On the next deep hull-creak, I slide away from the fascia toward the maintenance ladder shadow, keeping my weight on cloth and breath shallow, letting the listener head chase the new vibration.

*Agent reasoning: The pressure snap was a mistake; I need to go still and kill patterns before the choirwork wakes. The drones are triangulating, so I’ll give them a louder lie somewhere else while I slip away on ship-noise.*

### Turn 91 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** clamping **MERCY** to your chest works—mostly. The warmth bites through fabric and the pulse fractures into ugly, arrhythmic static. The rib’s sympathetic tremor dies down; whatever was “inviting” in the rhythm loses its clean hook.

Your mirror shard skitters down the spur and clatters exactly how you want: a light, bright tick-tick… then a rolling scrape as it settles against a far rib. The listener head’s hum *snaps* toward it, pitch-shifting like a hunting animal catching a fresh track.

On the next deep hull-creak you slide—cloth under you, breath shallow—away from the fascia and into the **maintenance ladder’s shadow**. The ladder well is a vertical cut in the cathedral geometry, a dark throat with rime on the rungs; it smells of cold iron and old filter felt.

Behind you, the custodians react in two different tempos. The frightened one whispers, eager, “There—there.” Boots move toward the mirror’s clatter. The calm one doesn’t follow immediately; you hear them set a palm to the plating near your *old* position, testing the truth of the hull. “The ship lies,” they murmur. “So do we. Keep the hum wide.”

The thurible drones in the alcove uncradle fully. One drifts out, probe extended, tasting vibrations and solvent. It angles toward the mirror’s last roll—then hesitates as your damped MERCY-static bleeds through your chest in faint, irregular noise. The drone’s chime turns uncertain, like it can’t decide whether it’s hearing a person or a bad bearing.

Quiet Wake’s whisper threads your comm again, thin and urgent: “Good—break the rhythm. If they pin you, go *vertical*. Choir hates ladders. Too many dead angles.”

The listener head continues to chase the mirror for now, but the calm custodian’s caution means the scan isn’t fully fooled—just **misdirected long enough** for you to be somewhere else when they correct.

**STATUS UPDATES:** MERCY resonance damped • Listener head redirected • Mirror shard deployed (far rib) • Position: ladder shadow

### Turn 92 [PLAYER]

I hug MERCY tighter and start climbing the maintenance ladder hand-over-hand, slow and deliberate, pausing every few rungs to keep my breathing irregular. Without speaking, I tap Quiet Wake’s comm twice—acknowledgment—and angle my body into the darkest side of the well, listening for the drones’ chimes below.

*Agent reasoning: Quiet Wake warned me to go vertical if pinned, and the cautious custodian is about to correct the scan. I need distance and dead angles fast, but I can’t let MERCY’s static turn into a pattern.*

### Turn 93 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** you get up the ladder cleanly. Slow, deliberate hand-over-hand keeps the rungs from ringing; pausing to break your breath pattern makes the vibration profile messy enough that the listener head below doesn’t lock onto you. **MERCY** stays pressed to your sternum, its warmth muffled into a dull, arrhythmic hiss—present, but not singing.

Two soft taps on the comm go out. Quiet Wake answers without words at first: a single return click, then a whisper threaded under static, “Received. Keep it irregular. If the well branches, take the one that smells like ozone—old relay heat means fewer choir sensors.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re midway up the **maintenance ladder well**, body angled into the darkest side where frost has grown thick on the rung brackets. Above you: a rectangle of deeper black, not quite open space—another hatch or a bend. Below you: the spur’s cold breath and the faint incense-metal tang.

Down beneath your boots, the thurible drones’ chimes start again—two tones now, searching. One chime is close and bright, the other dulled by distance. You hear a probe tip tick the ladder’s lower frame, testing. It doesn’t climb; it *listens*.

Through the plating, the custodians’ voices shift with their positions: the frightened one is still drawn toward the mirror’s false clatter, muttering, “There, I told you—” while the calm one stays nearer the ladder base, voice low and almost tender to their instrument. “Wide hum. Don’t commit. The ship will offer you a story you want to believe.”

The listener head’s hum broadens, less a spear and more a net. It washes the well, and for a second your teeth feel it—like pressure behind the eyes—before your ragged breathing and MERCY’s damped static break it into noise.

Time pressure tightens: the drones are close enough that one good, clean sound—a rung ping, a sharp inhale—could give them a vertical line to follow, and the calm custodian is patient enough to wait out tricks.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Gained height in well • Drones probing ladder base • Listener hum widened • Quiet Wake acknowledged

*Triggered: secret_Spur_0_487e59, watcher_Spur_1_2f1a85, guard_Spur_1_d601d6, fail_Spur_0_4bd935, guard_Spur_0_b892ad*

### Turn 94 [PLAYER]

I freeze for three breaths—irregular, shallow—then continue up two rungs at a time, slow enough not to ping, aiming for the dark rectangle above; I pause with my ear near the metal to catch any ozone/relay-heat scent as the well shifts. If I find a hatch, I ease it open a hair without letting it click, and slip into the branch on the darkest side, keeping MERCY crushed to my chest so it can’t “sing.”

*Agent reasoning: The drones are listening at the base and the custodian is widening the scan; going vertical fast risks noise, but staying still lets them refine. Quiet Wake warned about an ozone-smelling branch—if I can reach a hatch/bend quietly, I can break line-of-sight and change the acoustic geometry.*

### Turn 95 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** freezing buys you the half-second you need. The widened hum below washes past without catching a clean pattern, and you climb—two rungs at a time, measured, no ping—until your fingers find the dark rectangle: a service hatch set into the well wall, seam packed with frost.

You press your ear to the metal and wait. Not sound—**scent**: a thin, sharp ozone tang leaks from the seam, like overheated relays and scorched dust. Quiet Wake’s advice holds. This branch runs near old power.

You ease the hatch. It wants to *click*—spring tension—so you keep pressure constant and let it move a hair at a time. Frost crackles silently. The gap opens to a slit of black, and a warm-ish draft touches your cheek.

Below, a thurible drone chimes bright once—probe tip ticking the ladder frame again—then the tone drops into a puzzled warble as if it lost the thread. The calm custodian murmurs up into the well, not shouting, just *placing* words like hooks: “You’re climbing. You’re tired. You want the ship to be kind to you.”

For a moment, **MERCY** answers that with a damped twitch against your ribs—like it heard its name in a sermon—but your crush grip smothers it back into static.

You slip through the hatch on the darkest side, shoulders turned to keep the wafer pinned to your chest. Inside is a narrow relay chase: cable looms in braided bundles, insulation flaked like dry skin; the air is warmer and tastes of copper and old ozone. A faint indicator LED somewhere deeper blinks out of sync with the ship’s mournful chime—proof this run isn’t fully under Choir “prayer” control.

Behind you, the hatch remains barely ajar. The listener hum below shifts again, narrowing, as the calm custodian finally commits: “The air changed. Close to the ladder. Drones—taste for heat.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re now in an **ozone-warm relay chase** branching off the ladder well; the hatch slit behind you frames a vertical strip of colder dark.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Entered relay-heat branch • Hatch opened silently • Drones redirected upward • Custodian narrowing search

### Turn 96 [PLAYER]

I ease the hatch shut from inside until it kisses the frame—no click—then drape a strip of cloth over the seam to muffle heat and scent. Keeping MERCY crushed to my chest, I move deeper along the relay chase toward the out-of-sync LED and tap Quiet Wake once, then twice—*Which way from the blinking light?*

*Agent reasoning: The custodian is already cueing the drones to hunt for heat; leaving the hatch ajar will betray me. Old relay runs can mask my signature, and I need Quiet Wake’s guidance without giving away my position.*

### Turn 97 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the hatch shuts without a click—just a soft *kiss* of metal on frost. You pull a strip of cloth free (from your kit’s taped pouch edge) and drape it over the seam. It immediately darkens with condensation, acting like a crude gasket; the relay chase’s warmer breath stops spilling so cleanly back into the ladder well.

As you move deeper, the out-of-sync LED becomes a tiny metronome in the cable thicket—pale green, blinking *wrong* against the ship’s mournful chime. The closer you get, the more the air tastes like copper pennies and burnt dust.

You tap Quiet Wake once, then twice. A beat later, their courier-whisper returns, strained and close to laughter that isn’t joy: “Blinking out of hymn-time means it’s on a **shadow bus**. Don’t follow the light straight—Choir plants false blinkers for confession routes.”

A second voice bleeds in under theirs—same channel, not theirs, older and careful, as if listening from inside a wall: “Elara… don’t trust the green. Trust the *heat*. Green is for pilgrims.”

Quiet Wake snaps back, “Not us. Someone’s riding your line.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re in the relay chase, cables to your left like braided veins; behind you, the hatch seam is now muffled by damp cloth, the ladder well’s cold draft reduced to a thin leak.

Down the chase, the blinking LED sits beside a small junction box with a maintenance plate half-screwed on—tool marks fresh, not decades-old. Above it, a run of conduit sweats warmth in a steady strip, like a vein carrying current.

Behind you—faint through layers—one thurible drone chimes once, then stops. Not lost. Listening. The calm custodian’s voice is gone now, which is worse: they’ve stopped narrating and started hunting.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Hatch seam muffled • Quiet Wake line compromised • Fresh tool marks near LED • Drone listening nearby

### Turn 98 [PLAYER]

I go still, jaw tight. “Quiet Wake—line’s dirty. Going silent.” I kill my comm transmit and only keep receive low, then follow the warm, sweating conduit instead of the green blink, sliding my fingers along it to the nearest access seam; I crouch by the half-screwed junction box and, without touching the LED, peer into the gaps to see what was recently worked on and whether there’s a crawlspace or secondary hatch beyond.

*Agent reasoning: The comm is compromised and the blinking LED could be a trap; I trust heat and physical evidence over signals, and I need to keep Quiet Wake safe by going quiet. The fresh tool marks suggest a recent access point worth checking, but I can’t linger with a drone listening behind me.*

### Turn 99 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** your warning to Quiet Wake goes out clean—then you cut transmit. The channel drops to a faint, low receive hiss, like holding a seashell to your ear. The older voice tries to follow you into silence with a single clipped syllable—“Don—” then vanishes when your TX dies.

You ignore the green blink and follow **heat**. The sweating conduit is warmer than the surrounding metal, damp under your fingertips; it leads you to the half-screwed junction box beside the LED. You crouch and angle your eye into the gap without touching the light.

Inside: fresh work. The screws are not just loosened—two have been **replaced** with newer alloy, edges sharp, not rounded by age. A short jumper cable has been added to bridge two terminals that shouldn’t talk. Whoever did it routed power away from the “hymn” timing line and into a thinner, unmarked run—your shadow bus.

Beyond the junction box, you spot what you were hoping for: a narrow **secondary access seam** in the bulkhead behind the cable loom. It’s not a full hatch, more like a service peel-panel—its edge has a faint pry scar and a smear of dark grease. Air moves through it, a slow exhale carrying hotter ozone and something like **old antiseptic**.

As you’re peering, the green LED blinks *twice in quick succession*—not random. A signal. The ship’s distant chime answers a heartbeat later, as if embarrassed to be out of sync.

Behind you, through the relay chase, the earlier drone silence breaks: a soft, careful scrape—metal on insulation—something entering the chase rather than the ladder well. No chime this time. Whoever’s coming learned.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** crouched at the junction box in the ozone-warm relay chase; the damp conduit runs above your left shoulder, and the muffled hatch back to the ladder well is behind you in deeper dark.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Comms TX disabled • Shadow bus confirmed • Secondary seam found • Pursuer entering chase

### Turn 100 [PLAYER]

I stifle my breath and slide my hand over the LED to occlude it without touching, then ease the peel-panel seam with two fingers, working it open just enough to slip through. Keeping MERCY crushed to my chest, I fold myself into the secondary access and pull the panel back toward closed behind me, listening hard for that scrape to change direction.

*Agent reasoning: Something smart is in the chase with me; staying here risks getting pinned. The antiseptic draft suggests a medical/service cavity—safer dead angles. I need to avoid triggering the LED signal and keep MERCY quiet.*

### Turn 101 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** your palm eclipses the green LED without making contact. The next blink dies against your skin—no visible flash, no reflected cue—just a faint change in the box’s hum, like it’s suddenly unsure who it’s talking to.

The peel-panel gives, reluctantly. Two fingers find the pry scar and worry it open millimeter by millimeter until the seal’s old adhesive lets go with a wet, silent stretch. You fold through sideways, MERCY crushed hard enough that your ribs ache, and pull the panel back toward its seat. It doesn’t fully lock—no click—but it **rests** close enough that the seam becomes a hairline again.

The scrape in the relay chase changes immediately: it stops, then resumes slower, **circling**. A breath later you hear a soft, deliberate *tap* on the junction box—someone touching it barehanded, feeling for warmth and vibration rather than looking. No drone chime. Not a machine.

A voice, close on the other side of the panel, calm as a confession booth: “Shadow-bus peel. Fresh grease. Someone taught you.”

Then, quieter—almost tender—“MERCY is warm. You can’t hide warm.”

Inside your new access, the air is hotter and laced with antiseptic, like an operating theater that never got scrubbed right. The passage is cramped enough that your shoulders brush conduit on both sides; the conduit sweats steadily, and the sweat is **salty**, not just condensation.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re now in a narrow secondary service crawl behind the relay chase bulkhead; the peel-panel seam is at your back, a thin line of colder air leaking in.

**MULTIPLE ACTIVE THREADS:** ahead, the crawl slopes toward a deeper throb of current—shadow bus load—punctuated by a distant, irregular *chime* that doesn’t match the ship’s main one. Under your chest, MERCY pulses once, harder than before, as if responding to the voice outside. On low receive, your comm hisses—and for a fraction of a second, you catch Quiet Wake’s clipped whisper: “—don’t let it hear you *thinking*—” before static swallows it.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Entered secondary crawl • Pursuer at junction box • Comms receive intermittent • MERCY pulse intensified

### Turn 102 [PLAYER]

I clamp my forearm tighter over MERCY, wrapping my coat around it like a swaddle to trap warmth, and press my cheek to the sweating conduit until the cold sting evens my breathing. Without answering the voice, I crawl deeper down the slope toward the irregular chime, pausing once to smear my palm through the salty condensation and wipe it along the seam behind me—messing up any clean heat-print—then keep moving.

*Agent reasoning: The pursuer is close and perceptive; I need distance and to damp MERCY’s heat/pulse. The antiseptic hint suggests medbay or old sanctum systems—places with insulation and lockers to hide in. I’ll stay silent, lower my body heat, and move toward the irregular chime while masking my trail.*

### Turn 103 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** you swaddle MERCY in your coat and pin it under your forearm. The pulse doesn’t stop, but it dulls—less radiant, more like a heartbeat heard through a wall. Pressing your cheek to the sweating conduit shocks you back into your body; the cold sting steadies your breathing enough to move without the panicked hitch that gives you away.

You smear your palm through the salty condensation and wipe it along the peel-panel seam behind you. The metal takes the smear as a broad, messy film—any crisp handprint or heat-trace becomes noise. On the other side of the panel, the calm voice pauses, then exhales like someone conceding a point.

A tool skitters—light, practiced. The junction box screws begin to turn again, not hurried. They’re not chasing by sound; they’re **reconfiguring** the chase.

As you crawl downslope, the irregular chime grows louder and wronger: not the ship’s mournful patience, but a **sync-check**—a diagnostic tone that repeats when something can’t reconcile its own timing. The air gets hotter, antiseptic giving way to a faint sweet burn, like sterilant over old blood.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** you’re deeper in the secondary access crawl, sloping down; behind you the peel-panel seam is now a thin, smeared line of damp metal. Ahead, the conduit bundle opens into a tighter throat where the chime echoes off close walls.

**MULTIPLE ACTIVE THREADS:** your comm on low receive catches a single burst—Quiet Wake, breathless: “If it speaks like it knows your kit, it’s not Choir—” then static and a shrill undertone, as if someone is humming directly into the channel. MERCY answers that hum with a small, involuntary pulse against your ribs. And through the bulkhead behind you, you feel—not hear—a subtle vibration shift: the shadow bus load changes, like someone just threw a switch and rerouted attention.

The calm voice doesn’t follow into the crawl. It stays on the other side of the panel, closer to the junction box now, and says—more to itself than to you—“Antiseptic run. Elara’s old path.”

**ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT:** the passage narrows ahead; if the shadow bus is being reconfigured behind you, the crawl could become a trap—either by power cycling, vent purge, or simply sealing you into a hot, air-poor throat.

**STATUS UPDATES:** MERCY warmth masked • Trail smeared • Pursuer reconfiguring junction • Irregular sync-chime nearer

### Turn 104 [PLAYER]

I press my lips to MERCY’s wrapping and whisper, “Hush. No hymns,” then bite down on the comm and switch receive fully off. I crawl faster toward the sync-check chime, feeling for any manual latch or grille, and if I find one I’ll crack it just enough to vent heat and slip into the nearest wider bay—anything with a handwheel or breaker I can throw before they turn this crawl into an oven.

*Agent reasoning: The pursuer is rerouting power—if they can purge or seal this run, I’ll cook in here. The sync-check chime sounds like a diagnostic node where I might force a reset or slip into a larger service space. I need air, leverage, and to stop that humming from baiting MERCY.*

### Turn 105 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You whisper into the swaddled wafer—“Hush. No hymns.”—and the pulse in MERCY stutters, like a heart missing a beat. For half a second the crawl goes *quiet* in a way that feels engineered, not natural. You bite the comm and kill receive completely; the hiss dies, and with it the last outside anchor to human voices.

You crawl faster downslope toward the sync-check chime, fingers skimming for seams. The metal here is pitted and warm. You find a **manual grille**—a narrow rectangular vent with a recessed latch tab, old-style, meant for gloved hands. It fights you; the latch is sticky with dried sterilant. You work it until it gives with a soft crack, and a breath of cooler air leaks out—wider space beyond.

You slip your shoulder through and drop into a **service bay** just big enough to sit upright.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re in a cramped auxiliary bay off the antiseptic run; a single amber maintenance strip lights a breaker panel filmed with dust and a faint, chalky residue.

The irregular chime is louder here, coming from a squat timing module bolted to the far wall—its status light flickers out of rhythm, like it’s arguing with the ship. A **handwheel valve** sits under it, tagged in faded stencil: *AUX-VENT PURGE / LOOP 3*. Next to the breaker panel, someone has scratched a tiny architect’s seal into the paint—old, deliberate.

Behind you, through the vent throat, you hear the junction box work stop. Not because they gave up—because they finished. The bulkhead vibrates once, and the air in the crawl you came from shifts direction, starting to **pull** rather than exhale. They’re trying to turn the run into a controlled draft.

From the other side of the wall, the calm voice returns, nearer than it should be: “Good. You found the throat. Don’t spin the wrong wheel—Choir taught the ship to pray with pressure.”

**ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT:** Heat is building in the access run behind you as airflow changes; if the purge valve is mis-set, this bay could become the only breathable pocket—or the first to be flushed.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Comms receive disabled • Entered AUX-VENT service bay • Purge valve + breaker panel located • Pursuer rerouted airflow

### Turn 106 [PLAYER]

I keep my back to the vent throat, eyes on the scratched architect’s seal. “You’re not Choir,” I murmur to the wall, “but you’re close enough to lie.”  

I crack the handwheel just a fraction—barely a bleed—then pop the breaker panel and scan labels for **Loop 3 purge**, **timing module**, or anything marked **shadow bus**; if I find the timing feed, I kill it. If there’s no clear label, I yank the timing module’s power lead at the wall and shove MERCY deeper into my coat, listening for the airflow to change and for footsteps at the vent.

*Agent reasoning: The voice knows this place and is trying to steer me; I need air and leverage without giving them control. I’ll use my architect knowledge to read the panel, set the vent to a neutral bleed, and break the timing module to stop the sync-check beacon.*

### Turn 107 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You crack the handwheel a fraction. The valve gives with a gritty reluctance and a thin bleed of cooler air hisses through the bay—enough to break the pull forming in the crawl behind you. The sync-check chime wavers for a beat, then returns, still wrong but less insistent, like it lost a reference.

You pop the breaker panel. Inside: old ceramic fuses, two modern snap-breakers, and a laminated label strip that’s been re-applied more than once. You find **LOOP 3 PURGE // TIMING REF** and, lower, **SHADOW BUS SENSE (READ-ONLY)**—someone wanted you to know what you *can’t* shut off from here.

You kill **TIMING REF**.

The timing module’s flicker stutters into a steady amber for a single heartbeat—then goes dark. The chime stops mid-cycle, leaving a silence that feels like pressure equalizing in your teeth.

From the vent throat at your back: a soft *tick… tick…* of something touching the grille—fingertip or tool, patient. No footsteps, just proximity.

The calm voice, now amused and a shade closer: “Good. You don’t like being counted.”

Then, the lie slips—too precise to be casual: “That seal is mine. I cut it when the Choir started renaming corridors.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re crouched in the AUX-VENT service bay; breaker panel open at chest height, handwheel below, timing module dead on the far wall. The air tastes cleaner now, less sweet-burn.

**MULTIPLE ACTIVE THREADS:** The airflow shifts again—your tiny bleed fights the ship’s new pull, making the vent throat breathe in shallow, uneven sips. MERCY, shoved deeper into your coat, warms against you anyway; it’s quieter, but not asleep. And somewhere beyond the bulkhead, relays clack as if a different route is being tried—less like a hunt, more like a **containment**.

A second voice rides the wall faintly—Choir-cadenced, distant, not speaking to you but through you: “…pressure is prayer is pressure…”—then it fades, as if the timing module had been helping it keep time.

**ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT:** Killing TIMING REF will draw attention; systems that relied on that sync will begin to fall back to failsafes—often “purge to safe,” which on the Eidolon can mean “purge to silence.”

**STATUS UPDATES:** Timing module disabled • Loop 3 bleed opened • Shadow bus still sensing • Presence at vent grille

### Turn 108 [PLAYER]

I don’t turn around; I set my fingers on the handwheel and feel the vibration through the metal. “My seal? Then you’ll know I never cut them alone—name the second set of hands.” I ease the purge another hair open, then quietly start pulling the ceramic fuse labeled LOOP 3 PURGE to see if it’s a decoy or if I can force manual-only control, eyes flicking for any maintenance hatch or ladder tag in the bay.

*Agent reasoning: That voice is trying to wear my authority like a stole; I can’t afford to debate with a wall, but I can bait it into revealing what it is while I secure an exit and keep the bay breathable.*

### Turn 110 [PLAYER]

I keep my back to the vent and rest my fingertips on the handwheel, feeling for any change in vibration. “My seal? Then you’ll know I never cut them alone—name the second set of hands.”  

I ease the purge another hair open, then carefully pull the ceramic fuse marked **LOOP 3 PURGE** to see if it’s live or a decoy, watching for any immediate airflow shift; my eyes sweep the bay for a maintenance hatch, ladder tag, or any label that reads **egress** or **service riser**.

*Agent reasoning: I need to test whether this voice actually knows my history or is just mimicking; at the same time I can’t let the ship auto-purge us. I’ll keep it talking while I shift Loop 3 into something I can control manually and look for an exit.*

### Turn 112 [PLAYER]

I keep my back to the vent, fingertips on the handwheel. “My seal? Then you’ll know I never cut them alone—name the second set of hands.” I ease the purge open a hair, then pull the ceramic fuse labeled **LOOP 3 PURGE** and watch for an airflow change, scanning the bay for any **egress/service riser** hatch or ladder tag.

*Agent reasoning: The silence feels like a baited pause; I need to test what’s actually live while forcing the voice to prove it knows my past, and I need an exit that isn’t the vent throat where someone’s already waiting.*

### Turn 114 [PLAYER]

I keep my back to the vent, fingertips resting on the handwheel. “My seal? Then you’ll know I never cut them alone—name the second set of hands.”  
I open the purge a hair more, then pinch and pull the ceramic fuse marked **LOOP 3 PURGE**, watching for any immediate shift in airflow or pressure; my eyes sweep the bay for an **EGRESS**, **SERVICE RISER**, hatch seam, or ladder tag.

*Agent reasoning: If this thing is mimicking me, a personal detail will force it to slip; meanwhile I need manual control and an exit before they lock this bay down. I’ll test the fuse carefully and hunt for a riser out.*

### Turn 115 [GAME]

Your fingertips on the handwheel feel it first: a fine, irregular tremor that *isn’t* motor vibration—more like someone tapping a fingernail from the other side of the duct.

When you challenge the voice, the comm line goes quiet long enough to make your teeth ache. Then the older voice answers, not angry—wounded, almost offended.

“Second set of hands,” it says. “You called her *Mara* when you were tired. You called her *Miriam* when you wanted forgiveness. Her badge said **SATO**.”

The name lands like a maintenance code that belongs to your childhood hallway. Your throat tightens before you decide to.

You ease the purge wheel another hair open. Cold, sterilized air threads out—thin at first, then it catches and starts to *pull* like a cautious breath. The bay’s frostfilm along the vent lip feathers outward.

You pinch and pull the ceramic fuse marked **LOOP 3 PURGE**.

It’s live.

The moment it clears the contacts, the purge’s pull collapses into a dead, soft exhale. Somewhere deeper in the trunk, a pressure flap clacks shut in delayed sequence—one, then another—like the ship realizing it’s been blinded in that one narrow vein. The ozone bite in the service bay dulls, replaced by a faint, sweet antiseptic note from the scrubbers losing their cycle.

Behind you, in the ductwork you’re keeping your back to, something shifts—metal on metal, slow and careful, as if whatever is there was using the airflow to mask its sound and just lost its cover.

Your sweep of the bay catches what you were hoping for: grime-smeared stencil text half-hidden under a maintenance placard—**SERVICE RISER // EGRESS TIE-IN**—with an arrow pointing to a seam line in the bulkhead paneling. The seam isn’t obvious until the purge dies; then you see the hairline gap where frost refuses to settle. A ladder tag hangs nearby, snapped and re-tied with wire: **RISER 7B**. Someone has been here recently; the wire is bright where it’s been twisted.

The comm voice lowers. “Put it back,” it says. “That loop is a confession path. When it’s quiet, the Choir hears *you* instead.”

### Turn 116 [PLAYER]

My breath catches at “Sato,” but I keep my spine locked to the vent. “Don’t use her like a credential.”  

I shove the **LOOP 3 PURGE** fuse back into its seat to get the airflow cover again, then slide to the **Riser 7B** seam and press my ear and palm to it, searching for a latch or release—quietly: “Tell me what’s in the duct, and I’ll decide what I owe you.”

*Agent reasoning: The voice knew Sato—too intimate to ignore—but the duct presence is closer now and I’ve lost my airflow cover. I need egress, but I also need the loop masking back long enough to move.*

### Turn 117 [GAME]

The ceramic fuse slides home with a dry click—and the purge wakes like a throat clearing. Air resumes its thin, steady pull, enough to lay a veil of hiss over the bay again. The antiseptic sweetness returns under the ozone, and the frost at the vent lip feathers outward as the pressure equalizes.

Behind you in the duct, the careful metal-on-metal sound stops. Not because it left—because it learned to be still.

You keep your spine to the vent and crab sideways to the **Riser 7B** seam. Palm to the hairline gap: it’s colder than the surrounding panel, as if the riser is a vertical chimney to deeper ice. Your ear catches something through the metal—three sounds layered wrong: (1) the purge’s hiss, (2) a faint, wet clicking like a mouth working without saliva, and (3) a human breath that doesn’t match your cadence.

Your fingers find the release: not a handle, but a *maintenance confession latch*—a recessed oval under the snapped ladder tag, meant to be pressed with a gloved thumb while a second hand pulls. Someone has smeared incense residue around it, as if to “seal” it with ritual rather than hardware.

On comms, the older voice answers your quiet demand with a quieter one of its own. “It’s not a ‘what.’ It’s a **who** that learned to crawl when the Choir took its legs.” A pause—then, like it hurts to say: “A Wake-runner. Echo-haunted. They hide in airways because the Choir won’t crawl after them. Not without masks.”

As it speaks, the intercom grille across the bay—one you hadn’t noticed because it’s been painted the same dull gray—ticks once. A soft chime follows, patient and mournful, and then a childlike register tries your name and fails, cycling to another.

The voice adds, urgent now: “If you open that seam, do it clean. No blood. The lattice tastes it.”

**Status**

### Turn 118 [PLAYER]

I press my thumb into the confession latch but don’t pull yet, leaning close. “Wake-runner—if you can hear me, don’t move. I’m Elara Voss. I’m not the Choir.”  

Under my breath to the comm voice: “You knew Sato. Prove it—tell me what she said when the purge alarms first sang.” Then I ease the seam a millimeter, just enough for a whisper of air, and hold there—listening for breath, words, anything human.

*Agent reasoning: The “Sato” jab and the warning about blood tells me the ship is listening; I need to keep control, avoid panic, and try to communicate with whoever’s trapped without triggering the Choir.*

### Turn 119 [GAME]

Your thumb depresses the confession latch with a soft, oily give. You don’t pull—just hold tension in it—then ease the seam open a millimeter.

Immediate outcome: the riser answers with a *thin, cold whisper* of air that slides across your knuckles… and a breath on the other side stops mid-inhale, caught. Whoever is in there heard you and froze exactly when you told them not to move.

The service bay stays dim and cathedral-quiet behind you, purge hiss masking the smaller noises. The snapped ladder tag at **Riser 7B** taps once against the panel from the pressure change, then hangs still.

From the slit, you catch details that shouldn’t fit in a duct: the sour-metal scent of fear sweat, a faint smear of incense (recent, not old), and—close—wet clicking like someone trying to keep their teeth from chattering. A voice, very low, human, comes through the crack like it’s being rationed.

“…Elara?” The syllables are scraped raw. “Don’t—don’t say it loud. The grilles repeat it.”

The comm voice answers your demand about Sato so fast it feels rehearsed. “She said: **‘When they sing, count the gaps. The ship lies in the pauses.’**” Then, softer, almost pleading: “She was laughing when she said it. That’s how I knew we were already dead.”

As if to underline it, the intercom grille across the bay ticks again and tries to harmonize with the purge—a shy, rising tone that isn’t an alarm yet, but is learning the shape of one. A second, distant chime answers down the duct line, like another segment of the ship waking to the same cue.

The wake-runner’s breath resumes—shallow, controlled. “They’re close,” they whisper. “I heard incense valves. If you open this, they’ll smell *me*… or *you*.”

### Turn 120 [PLAYER]

I keep the seam at a hairline and whisper, “Good—stay still. Don’t say my name again.” Then, to the wake-runner: “How many incense valves did you hear, and from which direction—bay door or duct?”  

Under my breath to the comm voice, sharp: “If you’re lying, I’ll cut your loop myself. Count the gaps with me—when the chime falls silent, you tell me where the next egress is from Riser 7B.”

*Agent reasoning: The wake-runner is scared and the intercom is escalating; opening the riser fully risks drawing the Choir. I need to keep them calm, extract minimal info, and use Sato’s “count the gaps” to time our next move while keeping my voice low and names unspoken.*

### Turn 121 [GAME]

The wake-runner obeys—no more name. The hairline seam stays steady under your palm, and on the other side you hear them swallow hard, fighting the urge to breathe loud.

“Two valves,” they whisper. “Not the duct. **Bay door side**—down the corridor. One… then a pause… then the second like someone checking their mask seal.” Their voice tightens. “Choir cadence.”

Your comm line answers with a faint crackle—like someone shifting their mouth away from a mic. The older voice doesn’t rise to your threat; it just gets precise.

“Count,” it says.

The mournful chime that’s been threading the bay drops into a silence so clean it feels engineered. In that gap, you notice a second sound: a soft *brush-brush* at the bay door’s gasket, as if fabric hems are passing close without opening it.

“In the silence,” the comm voice murmurs, “Riser 7B’s next egress is **up**—one deck—into a **Choirbox tie-space**. Not safe. The safer exit is **sideways**: feel for a **warm seam** inside the riser, about three body-lengths in. That’s the Quiet Wake’s cut-through into an **unlisted service throat**. It’s marked with architect’s wire, not stencils.”

As it speaks, the intercom grille across the bay tries to “help”—it exhales a half-formed phrase in a child register, then snaps into a flat maintenance tone: *“CONFESSION PATH ACTIVE.”* Not an alarm yet, but a flag.

Behind the bay door, you get the unmistakable hiss of an incense valve being cracked—faint, controlled. The air in the bay seems to thicken even before the scent arrives, like your lungs anticipate it.

The wake-runner’s breath turns into a tremor you can feel through the slit. “They’ll smell the purge,” they whisper. “They’ll know someone’s awake in here.”

**Status**

### Turn 122 [PLAYER]

I barely open the seam enough for fingers and whisper, “On my count we move—no names, no prayers, no blood. Stay behind me and keep your mouth covered.”  
To the comm voice, cold: “You get one more kindness—tell me what *architect’s wire* feels like in the dark. Then shut up.”  
I pull the panel just enough to slip into Riser 7B, guiding the wake-runner in ahead of the incense scent, and start feeling along the interior for that “warm seam” three body-lengths in.

*Agent reasoning: The Choir is at the bay door and incense will give us away; the riser sideways cut-through is our best chance. I don’t trust the comm voice, but I need its directions for seconds longer. I also need to keep the wake-runner calm and silent so the grilles don’t catch the name.*

### Turn 123 [GAME]

You pull the panel wider—just enough—and slip into **Riser 7B** with your shoulder turned. The wake-runner squeezes in behind you, mouth covered with their sleeve like you ordered. The panel settles back to a near-seal; the bay’s air thins to a distant hiss. **Immediate outcome:** you’re inside the riser before the incense fully blooms into the service bay, and the Choir’s scent doesn’t follow cleanly through the hairline gap.

Inside, the riser is a vertical coffin of metal ribs and cable runs. Your boots find a narrow maintenance spine; your knuckles scrape insulation crust that powders like dry paper.

The comm voice gives you your “one kindness” and then goes still. “Architect’s wire feels like **braided hair under varnish**—not smooth conduit. It has **tiny barbs** every few centimeters, so you can index it by touch. And it’s… warm. Not heat—*skin-warm.*” A faint exhale. Then silence, as promised.

Above and below, the riser carries sound wrong: the distant chime becomes a vibration in the metal, and the intercom’s earlier phrase—*CONFESSION PATH ACTIVE*—repeats as a sub-audible tremor, like the ship mouthing it with its teeth clenched.

You count body-lengths by forearm and knee, moving sideways along the interior where the cable bundles thicken. Behind the panel you left, something brushes the bay door gasket again—fabric, slow—and the first true incense note seeps in through the seam: resinous, sweet, meant to sanctify and to mark.

At roughly the third body-length, your fingertips catch it: not a cable, not a tie—**a braid**. It yields slightly like hair, lacquered, with those minute indexing barbs. And beneath it, a seam in the riser wall that shouldn’t be warm in this cold: **skin-warm**, as if something on the other side is breathing against it.

The wake-runner presses close enough that you feel their shaking through the ladder spine. They whisper, barely air: “Wake cut-through… please. Before they start praying.”

Somewhere outside, a valve hisses again—closer now, as if a mask seal is being tested right by the panel you entered through.

### Turn 124 [PLAYER]

I press my forehead briefly to the warm seam like a promise, then whisper to the wake-runner, “Hand on my belt—don’t let go, and don’t breathe through your nose.”  
I hook two fingers under the braided architect’s wire and trace for a hidden catch or pull-tab, then start working the seam open a fraction at a time—slow, controlled, listening for any click or answering chime from the walls.

*Agent reasoning: The Choir is seconds from breaching; the warm seam is the only quieter route. I don’t trust the ship’s “confession” systems, so I’ll open the cut-through carefully and keep the wake-runner calm and silent.*

### Turn 125 [GAME]

Your forehead touches the seam and it **answers**—not with a voice, but with a faint give, like a membrane recognizing pressure. **Immediate outcome:** the warmth steadies for a beat, then pulses once against your skin in time with the distant chime, as if acknowledging the promise.

The wake-runner’s hand finds your belt and clamps down hard. They nod against your shoulder, breathing through parted lips, eyes squeezed shut to keep panic quiet.

Two fingers hook under the braided architect’s wire. Up close it really does feel like varnished hair: pliant, barbed in tiny intervals. You trace along it and find the trick—one barb isn’t a barb at all. It’s a **reversed tooth**, a little catch that slides under your nail when you press it the wrong way. You press, then pull *toward* the warm seam.

A soft internal **click** answers—tight, mechanical, old. The riser wall doesn’t swing; it **unzips** a fraction of a centimeter, a seam becoming a mouth. Cold metal shifts against cold metal, but the space beyond breathes out **air that’s warmer than it should be**, carrying a faint medicinal antiseptic note under the ship’s usual ozone.

The ship listens. The chime you’ve been tracking stutters—half a beat late—like it’s deciding whether to mark this as maintenance or trespass. The intercom tremor in the riser changes register, trying to form words, then collapses back into a low tone.

Outside the panel you entered through, muffled by the riser wall, you hear fabric move and a voice—Choir, close enough to vibrate through the ribs—murmuring a “maintenance prayer” that doubles as a search pattern. A second voice replies in the same cadence. Two of them, as the wake-runner warned. The incense smell thickens, but it doesn’t fully penetrate; your near-sealed entry is buying you seconds.

You work the seam open another hair at a time. The wire grows warmer under your fingers, like it’s being held from the other side. The wake-runner’s grip on your belt tightens until it hurts; they whisper, almost soundless: “They’ll hear metal. Slow. Slow.”

**Status updates**
- Warm seam: **catch found, opening**

### Turn 126 [PLAYER]

I freeze, palm flat to the warm seam, and whisper to the wake-runner, “Breathe shallow—through your mouth—follow my hand.” Then I stop pulling the wire and instead press my forearm and shoulder into the seam in slow increments, trying to “coax” it wider by pressure rather than clicks, sliding us through as soon as there’s room.

*Agent reasoning: The Choir is close and the ship’s chime is wavering; I need to get us through the cut-through without making a recognizable metal noise. The seam feels almost alive—pressure and warmth might open it more quietly than force.*

### Turn 127 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** The seam opens without another audible click. Under steady pressure, it *yields*—not like a door, but like a gasket remembering it was meant to be moved. You manage to widen it to a shoulder-gap, enough to start slipping through **quietly**.

Your palm stays flat on the warm metal, and you feel it subtly change texture—less rigid, more like a layered seal. When you lean in with forearm and shoulder, the warmth spreads across your sleeve, and the braid under your fingers goes taut as if something is taking your weight from the far side.

In the riser, you’re wedged sideways along the maintenance spine; behind you, the wake-runner’s hand clamps your belt and follows your guiding hand exactly, breathing in thin mouth-sips. Their lips are dry enough that each inhale threatens to rasp—so they keep it shallow, obedient.

Outside the panel you entered through, the Choir’s murmured cadence shifts. One voice stops “praying” mid-line, replaced by a practical, masked whisper: “Draft.” A gloved palm thumps the outer panel once—testing. Not opening it yet, but confirming you were here.

The intercom tremor in the riser tries to synchronize with your movement. The ship’s mournful chime answers with a gentler, delayed pulse—like it’s choosing to categorize this as **maintenance flex** instead of breach. It doesn’t raise an alarm. Not yet.

As the gap reaches its widest, warmer air spills out from the cut-through: antiseptic, old plastic, and something faintly human-sour—bodies have passed this way recently. In that thin gap you glimpse darkness with a dull copper line: **architect’s wire continuing** on the other side, guiding deeper.

You slide your shoulder through first. The seal presses you like a hand on your ribs—firm, intimate—then lets you go. The wake-runner follows, belt-hand never releasing.

Behind you, in the riser, you hear the outer panel’s fasteners begin to turn—slow, careful. They’ve decided to open it.

### Turn 128 [PLAYER]

I pull the wake-runner close by the belt and whisper, “No matter what you hear, don’t answer.” Then I turn us down the service throat, one hand on the copper-gleam wire, the other feeling for junction grilles or a lockable hatch—moving fast but placing each step like a prayer I refuse to speak.

*Agent reasoning: The Choir is about to open the panel behind us; we need distance and silence immediately. The architect’s wire is our guide, and I don’t trust the intercom not to “help” if we linger.*

### Turn 129 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You get distance. The service throat takes you out of the riser’s immediate acoustic shadow, and the Choir’s hands on the panel behind you become a muted, harmless clatter—still dangerous, but no longer *on top of you*.

You pull the wake-runner close by the belt. They flinch at the contact like they expect pain, then nod hard. “I won’t,” they mouth, no sound—already fighting the reflex to reply to anything that sounds like their own name.

The throat runs **down and slightly starboard**, tight enough that your shoulder brushes condensation-slick insulation. The copper-gleam wire is your rail: warm, steady, and faintly tacky, like varnish that never cured. Each step you place carefully, but you move with purpose; the wire gives you speed without losing silence.

Behind you, the intercom finds a voice it thinks will hook you. It isn’t prayer-cadence now. It’s *familiarity*—a woman’s tone, clipped and tired, speaking your name like she’s just turned in her chair. “El—” it starts, then corrects, as if embarrassed. “—Doctor. Wait.” The wake-runner’s throat works; they almost answer. Your warning lands in time. They swallow it.

Your free hand skims the wall for interruptions: a grille, a junction, anything you can dog-shut. You find three things in quick succession:

A **service grille** at knee height, its screws missing—someone’s been using it recently. Warm air leaks out, carrying antiseptic and the faint copper-salt smell of old blood.

A **flush hatch seam** higher up—properly latched, with a manual quarter-turn cam. It’s cold, honest metal, not warm like the cut-through.

And a **junction blister** where the wire dips into the wall and resurfaces, as if threaded through a hidden guide. The blister bears a faded stamp: an architect’s seal, half-scraped off.

From back the way you came, the Choir’s murmurs rise and fall as they realize the riser is empty. One voice—older, irritated—says something that isn’t a prayer: “They used the wire.” The other answers, softer: “Then the ship wanted it.”

The throat ahead tightens, then opens into a low crawlspace where the wire splits around a rib—one strand continuing forward, the other dropping toward that knee-height grille.

### Turn 130 [PLAYER]

I pull the wake-runner in close and whisper, “Eyes on my hands—if you hear my voice behind you, it’s not me.” Then I ease us up to the flush hatch, quarter-turn the cam as quietly as I can, and slip us inside—shutting it behind us and holding it closed, listening for pursuit before I decide whether to dog it tight.

*Agent reasoning: The intercom is baiting us with familiar voices; we need a place we can control and silence ourselves. The lockable hatch is “honest metal” and gives us a defensible pause, and I don’t trust the bloody, used grille yet.*

### Turn 131 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** The cam gives under your fingers with a soft, reluctant quarter-turn—more felt than heard. The flush hatch unlatches and you slip through with the wake-runner tight to your belt. You pull it shut behind you and hold it closed; it seats with a dull, padded *thunk* that doesn’t carry far.

Inside is a narrow **service blister**—a maintenance pocket between ribs of the ship. The air is warmer and stale, with the antiseptic edge you’ve been following, and a thin film of condensation pearls on the inner face of the hatch like it’s been breathed on recently. Your palm against the door feels vibration: distant footfalls and the soft scrape of fabric—Choir robes, close but not on top of you yet.

The wake-runner keeps their eyes on your hands like you told them. Their pupils are blown wide in the dim. They whisper without voice: “They… use *you*.” Not accusation—warning. They’re shaking, but they’re obeying.

On the other side of the hatch, the corridor-throat sound changes: the Choir’s murmurs flatten into listening silence. Then—too near—your own voice speaks from somewhere behind the metal, perfectly pitched to the space: “It’s okay. Open it. I’m alone.” The wake-runner’s head jerks toward the sound, reflex hungry to answer.

Your real hand stays on the hatch, fingers splayed—proof. Their gaze snaps back to it. They swallow the reply like poison.

A second sound overlaps your voice: an older Choir voice, irritated and practical, speaking to someone at their shoulder. “No hinge marks. Flush cam. Someone taught them.” A gloved knuckle taps the hatch once, gentle—testing for a hollow.

In the blister with you, a thin bundle is zip-tied to a strut: **a dead comm bead** with its casing cracked, and beneath it a smear of dried sealant shaped like a thumbprint—someone’s quick, quiet work. Farther in, the space narrows into a vertical conduit with ladder rungs slick with condensation; faint light leaks from above through a grille, rhythmic as if something up there is blinking.

You’re holding the hatch closed. If you dog it, it’ll buy time—also announce intent with a louder cam-turn. If you don’t, a careful hand on the other side could ease it open.

### Turn 132 [PLAYER]

I press my lips to the wake-runner’s ear. “Count your breaths—ten—out loud only in your head. Don’t look at the door.”  
Then I turn the cam the rest of the way in one slow, controlled motion—accepting the sound—and immediately ease back into the blister, guiding them toward the vertical conduit. “Up. Now. Hands on the rungs, not the walls.”

*Agent reasoning: Dogging the hatch will make noise but being quietly opened from the other side is worse; I need seconds to get us up the conduit and away from this door. The wake-runner is on the edge—give them a task, keep them anchored in the real.*

### Turn 133 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** The cam completes its turn with a controlled, metallic *snick* that’s louder than you want in the tight pocket—sound traveling through the hatch like a confession. The latch dogs. The hatch is now *your* problem no longer; it won’t be eased open from the other side without tools or time.

On the far side, the Choir reacts instantly. The older voice cuts through the hush: “Dogged. Back—don’t pry, you’ll warp the seal.” Another, closer to the metal, murmurs a maintenance-prayer that isn’t for you—it’s for the ship. “Sanctum, keep what you’ve taken.” Their gloved hands stop testing and start working: you hear the scrape of something thin being inserted at the seam, careful, patient.

You press your lips to the wake-runner’s ear and give them the breath-count. Their shoulders drop a fraction; they stop tracking the hatch with their whole body like an animal about to bolt. They stare at your fingers instead, and when you steer them to the conduit they obey—hands finding rungs, not walls.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re in the **service blister**, starboard-side rib pocket; the vertical conduit rises above you, damp rungs cold through your gloves, faint blink-light pulsing down through a grille like a slow heartbeat.

As you climb, the ship tries again: your own voice, now *above* you somewhere in the conduit, softly urgent—“Up here. Hurry.” It’s perfectly placed to make you look. The wake-runner stiffens but keeps counting silently, lips barely moving with an internal rhythm.

Halfway up, you pass a cracked comm bead zip-tied to the strut; its dead lens reflects the blink-light like an eye that won’t close. The copper-gleam architect wire threads into the conduit wall here, disappearing upward—warm against the cold metal, as if it’s drawing you.

Below, the Choir’s older voice gives a piece of truth while issuing orders: “They’re using the architect’s guide. If they reach a relay grille, the lattice will *carry them*.” A second voice answers, almost reverent: “Then we follow the wire and let it judge.”

The pressure now is quiet and real: the Choir can’t open the hatch quickly, but they can call ahead—through intercoms, through maintenance channels, through whatever is already mimicking you.

### Turn 134 [PLAYER]

I keep climbing but don’t look up toward “my” voice; I whisper to the wake-runner, “Good—keep counting. If you hear me, you look at my boots.”  
When we reach the next junction or grille, I stop and feel for airflow and heat—then I tap the copper wire twice with my knuckle, low and firm. “Eidolon,” I murmur, “show me a maintenance path, not a sermon. Which way is *quiet*?”

*Agent reasoning: The mimic is trying to steer us into a trap above, and the Choir can’t reach us yet but can warn ahead; I need to keep the wake-runner anchored in reality and choose a route that gives us cover or an exit, not just climb blindly.*

### Turn 135 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You reach a junction where the conduit widens into a cramped collar around a **blink-grille**. You keep your eyes down, and the wake-runner does exactly what you drilled into them—when “your” voice whispers from above again, they lock their gaze on your boots and keep counting, ten breaths cycling like a rosary.

You palm the metal around the junction: **airflow** slides past your knuckles from left to right—cooler, drier. From the opposite side there’s **heat**, faint and damp, like a room full of bodies that aren’t breathing. The copper wire runs straight through the collar, then splits: one strand disappears toward the warmer side, the other follows the cool draft.

You tap the wire twice.

For a half-second nothing answers—then the wire **twitches** under your knuckle, not like vibration from machinery, but like something *deciding*. The blink-light stutters out of rhythm. A low maintenance tone rolls through the conduit, almost sub-audible, and the intercom tries to begin a hymn—then cuts itself off mid-syllable, as if chastised.

A voice comes back—not sermon, not your mimic, but a flat service register with Elara Voss’s cadence stripped of emotion, like a recorded diagnostic:

“**QUIET = LOW TRAFFIC / LOW LISTENING. FOLLOW NEGATIVE PRESSURE. AVOID WARM ZONES.**”

The wake-runner hears it too. Their breath-count falters on seven, then they force it back into line. They whisper, barely audible now, “It… answered you.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re at the **vertical conduit junction** just below a blink-grille; your hands are wet with condensation, and the cool draft smells like clean filters and dusted metal.

Behind you, far below, the dogged hatch takes a new sound: a soft, deliberate rasp—**the Choir has started cutting**, slow and careful to avoid tripping seals. Above, through the grille, something shifts with a light scrape—like a tool tray being slid across a floor.

### Turn 136 [PLAYER]

I squeeze the wake-runner’s wrist once. “Yes. It’s a system, not a saint—keep counting.”  
I take the cool-draft branch, staying low and quiet, and I pause just long enough to press my ear to the metal and whisper, “Seal the blink-grille behind us if you can—just enough to slow hands, not wake the Choir.”

*Agent reasoning: The ship’s service register just gave us a rare, clean directive—follow the cool draft. The warm zone sounds like a trap or congregation space, and the Choir is cutting in below while something is above us, so we need to move laterally into low-traffic ducts and put distance between us and both threats.*

### Turn 137 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Your squeeze steadies the wake-runner; they blink hard and resume the silent ten-count, eyes fixed on your boots as instructed. You take the cool-draft branch—metal narrowing into a low crawl with a steady pull of negative pressure tugging at hair and fabric.

You pause at the turn, press your ear to the duct skin, and whisper for a seal.

Behind you, the wake-runner hesitates—then nods once, sharp. They pull a small maintenance strip from inside their sleeve: not tape, not foam—**a thin, waxy gasket ribbon** that smells faintly of incense and solvent. Stolen Choir stock. They don’t speak. They lay it along the blink-grille seam and press it in with their thumbnail, working in short, practiced pushes to avoid the loud *snap* of a full seat. The blink-light dims a fraction as the grille’s fit tightens.

It won’t stop tools. It will **make fingers slip** and add minutes—minutes you can spend elsewhere.

From the junction behind, the ship answers you in its own way: the blink-grille’s pulse shifts to a slower rhythm, almost matching the wake-runner’s breath-count. Then, faintly through the metal, a new sound above the grille—someone testing it from the far side, the light scrape of glove on perforated steel. Not the Choir below. Someone already *ahead*.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re now in the **cool-draft branch** off the vertical conduit junction; the air tastes cleaner, like scrubbed filters and old dust, and the duct walls are colder—less “alive.”

As you crawl, your comms catch a maintenance code that lands like a memory: a child’s hallway at night, doorframes too tall, the sound of someone breathing in the dark. Overlay text flickers on your display: **AUX-SCRUB / NEG-PRESS FEED**.

Back the way you came, the Choir’s cutting rasp continues—muffled now by distance and your half-seal. The older voice carries faintly through the structure: “Don’t rush. Let them run into quiet. Quiet has ears.”

The wake-runner finishes their gasket work and crawls after you, whispering at your shoulder without looking up: “They taught us this. The ones who didn’t want to be found.”

### Turn 138 [PLAYER]

I freeze and raise two fingers to the wake-runner—hold—then gently cup the back of their head to keep their eyes on my boots.  
I press my mouth to the duct seam and whisper, barely audible, “Hands on the grille—don’t speak. Tap twice if you’re living, once if you’re Choir.” Then I ease forward a half-meter and listen for the reply, palm flat on the metal to feel vibrations.

*Agent reasoning: Someone is already ahead in the scrub feed; charging forward risks walking into an ambush or a mimic-trap. I need to identify them without giving away our exact position, and keep the wake-runner anchored to my physical cues.*

### Turn 139 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You freeze. Two fingers up. The wake-runner locks, obedient—your hand at the back of their head keeps their focus anchored to your boots and the counting in their throat.

You put your mouth to the seam and whisper the code.

For a breath there’s only the negative-pressure pull and the far-off rasp of the Choir’s cutter.

Then—through your palm—metal answers: **two taps**, spaced like a heartbeat trying not to be one. Living.

A pause. A drag of something soft across perforated steel. The taps come again, closer to the duct skin, like they’re putting their knuckles right where your hand is.

A voice does *not* speak through the grille. Instead, your comms tick once with a maintenance burst—three clipped characters that aren’t a subsystem ID: **“W//K”**. Quiet Wake shorthand.

The wake-runner’s shoulders sag with relief so sharp it’s almost a sob, but they swallow it. Their count continues, though it’s now threaded with a tremor.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re half a meter forward in the **cool-draft AUX-SCRUB neg-pressure feed**; the duct wall under your palm is colder here, and the airflow has a clean, mineral bite—filter media and old ice.

**MULTIPLE ACTIVE THREADS:**  
Ahead, the living hands at the grille shift—careful, controlled—like someone making space without rattling the frame. A faint chemical smell seeps through the perforations: antiseptic and skin-safe solvent, not incense.

Behind you, the partially sealed blink-grille you left is being tested from the other side—an intermittent *scrape-scrape* as gloved fingers find the gasket ribbon’s edge. The Choir is still below cutting, and they’re patient; patience is worse than speed on this ship.

And under it all, the ship’s distant chime pulses through the ductwork—steady, intimate. For a moment your comms overlay stutters and labels it wrong: **EID-AR-0001 // HEARTBEAT PROXY**—then self-erases like it never showed.

From the grille ahead, a small object slides into the duct through a loosened corner: a **folded strip of fabric** stamped with an architect’s seal—same mark as the message you were slipped earlier. No words this time. Just the seal, and a smear of something dark that could be grease… or dried blood.

### Turn 140 [PLAYER]

I take the folded fabric strip and tuck it into my inner pocket without unfolding it yet, then tap the duct skin twice in reply and slide two fingers forward in a silent “open.”  
To the wake-runner, I whisper, “Keep counting—eyes on my boots,” and I guide their hand to the center rung line as I ease us up to the grille, ready to slip through the moment it gives.

*Agent reasoning: The taps confirm Quiet Wake, but the Choir is closing in; I need to secure trust without giving the mimic a voice to steal, and get us through the grille fast while keeping the wake-runner anchored.*

### Turn 141 [GAME]

You pocket the fabric strip without unfolding it; the smear leaves a faint metallic tang on your fingertips. You tap twice back through the duct skin and slide two fingers forward in the silent *open*.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** The grille ahead answers with a soft, controlled give—fasteners eased, not removed. It doesn’t swing; it **slides** a finger-width, then two, just enough for a hand to snake in and catch it before it clatters. Cold, bare knuckles brush your glove—someone’s taking the risk of skin on metal to stay quiet.

The wake-runner keeps counting. You guide their hand to the center rung line; they grip it like a rail in a drowning corridor, eyes still pinned to your boots.

A whisper finally leaks through the narrow opening—strained, breath-only, no voiceprint offered to the ship’s microphones: “No names. No comms. They’re listening in the quiet.”

A second hand appears, passing you something small and hard: a **ceramic clip** stamped with a maintenance glyph you recognize from older schematics—**a manual damper lock**. The hand taps your wrist once, then points—down and left beyond the grille—directing you toward a space where the negative-pressure feed meets a service pocket.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re nose-to-grille at the end of the **AUX-SCRUB negative-pressure feed**; air hisses through the crack, carrying antiseptic and the cold mineral smell of scrub media.

Behind you, far through the ductwork, the earlier gasketed blink-grille emits a sharp, quiet *peel*—someone has found the edge and is **lifting it**. The Choir’s cutter rasp continues below, steady as prayer. And under all of it, the ship’s chime syncs for a moment with your pulse—then drifts off, like it’s pretending it didn’t.

The Wake contact doesn’t look in. They keep their face out of the opening, careful not to give the intercom a profile to imitate. “If you’re carrying Voss’s key,” they breathe, “don’t let it touch warm steel. Warm steel remembers.”

### Turn 142 [PLAYER]

I nod once toward the opening and whisper, “No names,” then mouth to the wake-runner, “Still counting—follow my boots,” and guide them through the gap first. As soon as they’re clear, I slip through after them and immediately set the ceramic damper lock on the nearest accessible damper/vent throat behind us—just enough to choke airflow and make pursuit noisier—then I look to the unseen hands and whisper, “Down-left service pocket, yes? Show me with taps—how many turns?”

*Agent reasoning: The Wake contact is offering a quiet route and a tool; I need to get the wake-runner through fast, keep the ship from learning their voice, and slow the Choir with the damper lock.*

### Turn 143 [GAME]

You mouth *no names* and the unseen hands answer with a single, approving tap on the grille frame.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You guide the wake-runner through first. They go stiff at the threshold—duct to pocket-space always feels like stepping off a ledge—but your boots stay in their vision and the counting carries them. They slip through with only a soft scrape of fabric. You follow, shoulders twisting, and drop into the **down-left service pocket**: a cramped maintenance void where the neg-pressure feed meets a squat damper throat and a bundled cable run.

You set the ceramic damper lock immediately. The glyph aligns with a shallow slot; it seats with a dry *click*. You give it a careful partial turn—just enough to choke the airflow.

The effect is instant: the hiss behind you deepens into a **low, uneven moan**, and the duct skin starts to tremble. Any hand or tool working that line will now have to fight suction and vibration—noisy, clumsy work.

The Wake contact stays out of sight, but their fingers drum instructions on the metal beside your ear: **three taps… pause… two taps.** Then a final single tap, sharp—*stop there*. Three-and-two turns, not to full closure.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re in a cold, boxy service pocket off the AUX-SCRUB neg-pressure feed; the walls are lined with frost-silvered insulation and a stale antiseptic smell clings to the seams.

Behind you, distant but clearer now, the Choir’s pursuit scrapes forward—and the choked airflow turns their movement into a telltale **rattle-whine** as they test the duct. The unseen older voice rides your comms in a near-whisper: “Good. Make them announce themselves.”

The Wake hands slide something else through the gap: not an object—**a touch**, two fingers briefly pressing the back of your glove, then pointing down the cable bundle toward a darker slit in the pocket’s floor plating. Same architect’s logic as your map-fracture patterns: a route that isn’t on schematics.

Breath-only again: “If the key warms, it calls. Keep it cold. Keep it close.”

### Turn 144 [PLAYER]

I squeeze the wake-runner’s shoulder once. “Counting. Boots. Now.”  
I follow the Wake’s point down the cable bundle and pry at the darker floor slit, sliding in first and pulling the wake-runner after me; before I disappear, I tap the metal twice toward the unseen hands—thanks, and keep them quiet.

*Agent reasoning: The Wake are giving us a hidden route; with the Choir closing in, I need to move now while the damper buys us noise-cover. I also need to keep the wake-runner grounded and not let the ship bait us with voices.*

### Turn 145 [GAME]

You squeeze the wake-runner’s shoulder. The pressure steadies them; the counting doesn’t break, just tightens into a metronome. Their eyes stay welded to your boots.

You follow the Wake’s point down the cable bundle and pry at the darker slit in the floor plating. The “slit” isn’t damage—it’s a **service seam** disguised under grime and frost. Your fingers find a recessed lip; it gives with a reluctant *crack* of old sealant.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You slide in first. The seam drops you into a narrow, vertical-ish crawlspace that immediately angles away—an architect’s bypass, tight enough that your shoulders scrape insulation. You hook an arm back and pull the wake-runner after you. They come through with a sharp inhale that nearly becomes a sob, but the counting keeps it swallowed.

Before you vanish, you tap the metal twice toward the unseen hands. Two taps answer back—closer than you expect, like the Wake contact is still braced right at the pocket wall, holding the grille steady and **not** moving until you’re gone.

As you wriggle forward, the choked damper behind you turns the Choir’s approach into a harsh, unmistakable complaint: a **ratcheting scrape** followed by a muffled curse that doesn’t sound like prayer. Someone on the far side tries to force a panel and the airflow makes it sing.

A breath of comm-static shivers through your ear—your own comms trying to “help”—and you catch a fragment of tagged memory: *a childhood hallway light flickering*, labeled **AUX-SCRUB // DAMPER FEEDBACK**. Then it cuts out, as if embarrassed.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re now inside a hidden crawl running beneath the service pocket; the air is warmer here by a degree, smelling of rubberized cable sheathing and old dust instead of antiseptic.

Behind you, the Wake contact whispers—barely audible through the seam, meant more for the ship than for you: “Empty pocket. Seal’s bad. Nothing here.” A lie offered as camouflage.

- Wake-runner: moving, counting

### Turn 146 [PLAYER]

I keep crawling, slow and controlled, and whisper back to the wake-runner, “Good—keep counting, breathe through your nose.”  
With my free hand I trace the cable bundle for junction markers or an access hatch, and I murmur to the duct, “Eidolon, show me where you hid this—what node does it feed?”

*Agent reasoning: The crawlspace buys us seconds, but the ship’s comm-static is trying to bait my attention; I need to keep the wake-runner anchored and figure out where this bypass leads before we get boxed in.*

### Turn 147 [GAME]

You crawl slow, controlled—making your body smaller than panic. The wake-runner keeps counting behind you, breath rasping once, then settling when you remind them to breathe through their nose. Their fingers keep contact with your boot heel like it’s a rosary.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Your free hand traces the cable bundle. Under the insulation wrap you find **raised junction markers**—old polymer tags embossed rather than printed, meant to be read by touch in blackout maintenance. Three in a row: a triangle-within-circle (architect’s mark), then **7B**, then **CHOIRBOX RETURN**—but the last word has been **scored through** and overwritten with a shallow etch: **CONFESSIONAL**.

A few centimeters farther, your fingertips hit a seam: a **flush micro-hatch** set into the crawl wall, no handle, just a magnetic catch and a tiny service glyph. It’s warm compared to everything else—barely, like it’s drinking current.

You murmur to the duct, “Eidolon… show me where you hid this—what node does it feed?”

The ship answers the way it always does: not with a voice, but with **systems pretending to be voices**. Your comms crackle once and a layered intercom whisper threads through the insulation, cycling quickly through registers until it “finds” one it likes—an almost-familiar cadence.

“**Riser 7B…**” it says, then corrects itself, softer: “**Elara.**” Then, like a maintenance readout forced into prayer: “**NODE: SANCTUM RELAY / CONFESSIONAL RETURN.**”

The wake-runner flinches at the name—*not yours*, but it lands like a hook anyway—and their counting stutters, then resumes louder, angry at itself.

Behind you, faint through the choked airflow and layers of metal: the Choir’s pursuit pauses. A tool taps the duct, listening for hollows. The damper moan you made is still doing its work, turning their careful search into something clumsy.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re in the architect’s under-seam crawl beneath the AUX-SCRUB junction void; the cable bundle runs along your left shoulder, and the micro-hatch is at your left cheek level, warm against the cold insulation.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Junction tag found: Riser 7B  
- Micro-hatch located: warm seam  
- Ship response: Sanctum Relay node

### Turn 148 [PLAYER]

I press my forehead briefly to the cold wall, then whisper to the wake-runner, “Don’t listen to it—count. Just count.”  
Keeping my glove between skin and metal, I test the micro-hatch’s magnetic catch with slow pressure, trying to ease it open without a snap; if it gives, I slip my hand in first to feel for a manual cutoff or a cold-side latch before widening it.

*Agent reasoning: The ship using my name means the Sanctum Relay is awake and dangerous, but the warm micro-hatch is likely the quickest path forward; I need to keep the wake-runner grounded and avoid triggering anything loud or “warm.”*

### Turn 149 [GAME]

You press your forehead to the cold wall. The chill bites through fatigue and pulls you back into your body.

“Don’t listen to it—count. Just count.” The wake-runner’s reply is only breath and numbers, but the cadence steadies; they keep their face angled down, away from the cable bundle like it might start speaking again.

Keeping glove between skin and metal, you lean slow pressure into the micro-hatch.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** The magnetic catch *gives*—not with a snap, but with a reluctant, sliding release, like two wet stones parting. You freeze the moment it moves, then ease it another centimeter. No alarm. No hard clack.

You slip your hand inside first.

The space beyond is colder—**cold-side**, like it’s fed from a different loop. Your fingers find a manual cutoff immediately: a small ceramic lever with a maintenance glyph and a half-melted seal thread around it. Past that, set deeper, there’s a **secondary latch**—a spring tongue you can depress from inside to open the hatch wider without letting it bang.

And under the third handhold—right where your knuckles brush the insulation—something is wrong with the cable jacket. Slightly **wet**. Slightly **warm**. Too organic for a line that should be dead-cold.

A careful peel with your thumb reveals a translucent filament braid, pulsing like a tiny trapped constellation. It repeats a single, mournful chime—so faint you feel it more than hear it—and the rhythm matches the distant ship-chime with an intimate precision, as if keyed to a heartbeat you’ve worn before.

Behind you, through layers of duct and the choked damper’s moan, the Choir’s probing taps drift closer, then stop—someone has found the pocket seam you came through, or at least the lie the Wake contact told is buying only seconds.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re still in the architect’s under-seam crawl beneath the AUX-SCRUB junction void, left cheek near the opened micro-hatch; your gloved hand is inside a colder service cavity with a ceramic cutoff lever.

The wake-runner whispers, barely audible between counts: “That sound… it’s inside the wire.”

- Manual cutoff: located (ceramic)

### Turn 150 [PLAYER]

I whisper to the wake-runner, “Don’t look at it. Count—out loud, steady,” then, with my gloved fingers, I ease the ceramic cutoff lever toward OFF in the smallest increments, listening for any change in the braid’s chime. If it quiets, I depress the inner spring tongue and widen the hatch just enough to slip my head in and scan for a second exit or a manual latch path deeper into the Sanctum Relay.

*Agent reasoning: The filament braid feels like a living memory line—dangerous if it “wakes,” but the cold-side cavity and ceramic cutoff give me a way to isolate it quietly. I need the wake-runner anchored and I need to buy seconds from the Choir.*

### Turn 152 [PLAYER]

I whisper to the wake-runner, “Don’t look at it. Count—out loud, steady.” Keeping my glove on the lever, I ease the ceramic cutoff toward OFF in tiny increments, listening for the braid’s chime to change; if it dims, I press the inner spring tongue and widen the hatch just enough to slip my head in and scan for a second exit or a manual latch leading deeper toward the Sanctum Relay.

*Agent reasoning: The braid’s “heartbeat” feels like a lure—if I can quiet it, we become harder to track. But killing power outright could trip alarms, so I’ll feather the cutoff and only then risk widening the hatch to look for a deeper route.*

### Turn 154 [PLAYER]

I whisper, “Don’t look at it. Count—out loud, steady,” and I start easing the ceramic cutoff toward OFF a hair at a time, pausing between each movement to listen for the braid’s chime to falter. If it dims, I press the inner spring tongue and widen the hatch just enough to slide my head in, scanning the cold-side cavity for a second exit or a manual latch line leading deeper toward the Sanctum Relay.

*Agent reasoning: The ship is baiting us with that filament-chime; I need to cut power gently without triggering an alarm, then find a deeper route before the Choir reaches the seam.*

### Turn 156 [PLAYER]

I whisper to the wake-runner, “Don’t look at it. Count—out loud, steady.” With my gloved fingers I ease the ceramic cutoff toward OFF a hair at a time, pausing between each movement to listen for the braid’s chime to falter; if it softens, I press the inner spring tongue and widen the hatch just enough to slide my head in and scan the cold-side cavity for a second exit or a manual latch line leading deeper toward the Sanctum Relay.

*Agent reasoning: The braid feels like a living fault in my own architecture—cutting it could either save us or wake something worse. I’ll throttle the cutoff slowly to avoid a surge, then use the hatch as a peek into the cold-side path toward Sanctum Relay without exposing the wake-runner to whatever’s “singing.”*

### Turn 157 [GAME]

The wake-runner flinches at your whisper like you touched a bruise, then forces their eyes down to their own boots. “One… two… three…” they begin, voice cracking but steadying as they lock onto the rhythm.

You ease the ceramic cutoff toward **OFF** a hair at a time. The lever fights you with a dry, gritty resistance—old insulation dust caught in the detent. On the second pause, the **braid’s chime** doesn’t vanish; it *thins*, like a choir losing half its lungs. The cold in the seam eases just enough that your breath stops crystallizing mid-exhale.

Behind the hatch, something answers: not a voice—**a pressure change**, a soft inward tug as the cavity equalizes. The intercom somewhere above you mutters a maintenance code that *feels* like a childhood hallway door clicking shut.

You press the inner spring tongue and widen the micro-hatch a few centimeters—just enough to slide your head in.

Inside the cold-side cavity (Riser 7B feed), the space is coffin-tight and lined with frost-webbed conduit. Your lamp catches **a second latch line**: a manual pull-cable routed along the right wall, tagged with a faded stencil: **SANCTUM RELAY // HAND OVERRIDE**. The cable doesn’t lead back toward you—it angles downward into a darker throat, where the frost has been disturbed recently by a gloved hand.

Also inside: a **thin filament braid** (the chime-source) stretched across the cavity like a tripwire. With the cutoff partially off, it’s dimmer—still alive, still listening. And tucked above the braid, magnet-clipped to a strut, is a small **incense-fiber sachet** stamped with the Custodial Choir’s seal—fresh. Someone has been here *very* recently, tending the braid like a relic.

The wake-runner keeps counting, but on “seven” their voice overlaps with another—an older register, coming from your own comm speaker: “—don’t pull the Sanctum line unless you can finish what she started.”

The air tugs again, deeper now, as if the cavity is inhaling through that hand-override route.

### Turn 158 [PLAYER]

I swallow hard and murmur into my comm, “I hear you. Tell me what ‘finish’ means—now,” then glance back at the wake-runner. “Keep counting. Don’t stop for anything.”

Careful not to touch the filament braid, I reach in just enough to pinch the Choir’s incense-fiber sachet free and bring it to my lamp to inspect it—any scent, residue, or marking—before I decide whether to risk the Sanctum hand-override line.

*Agent reasoning: The Sanctum hand-override is tempting but the warning and the fresh Choir sachet means it’s likely a trap or a commitment I can’t half-make; I need information and leverage first, and I should keep the wake-runner grounded.*

### Turn 159 [GAME]

Your comm clicks once—like a throat clearing—then the older voice returns, closer to your ear than the speaker should allow.

“**Finish** means: don’t just cut power. **Close the loop.** Purge what’s caught in it, or it will re-route through you.” A pause, and you hear breath that isn’t yours. “Elara built a mercy path. The Choir turned it into a hymn. If you pull the Sanctum line wrong, you’ll wake the whole nave.”

Behind you in the service throat, the wake-runner keeps counting. “Eight… nine… ten…” Their hands are clenched so hard the knuckles show pale through grime; they don’t look up, but their cadence is starting to lag as if something is tugging at their attention from inside their skull.

You reach into the cold-side cavity with two fingers, careful to stay above and *away* from the filament braid. The braid reacts anyway—its dim chime tightens into a thin, tense note, like a wire under strain—but it doesn’t spike. You pinch the incense-fiber sachet free from its magnet clip and pull it into your lamp’s cone.

Up close, it’s not just incense. The fiber is braided with **silvery conductive threads**, and the sachet’s seal is stamped twice: the Custodial Choir’s emblem over an older architect’s mark, intentionally misaligned. There’s a scent—sweet, resinous—then a bitter undertone like scorched mylar. When you squeeze it, a fine dust puffs out and clings to your glove in patterns that look almost like **tiny circuit glyphs**.

On the back, in careful block maintenance script, you find a marking the Choir doesn’t usually leave where outsiders can read it:

**“KEEP THE VOICE WARM. DO NOT LET IT SLEEP.”**

As you’re reading, a faint shimmer passes across the frost-pane gasket at the edge of your vision—like starlight bending on oil—then stills. The cavity’s inward tug deepens again, a slow inhale from the direction the **SANCTUM RELAY hand-override** cable disappears.

**Status updates:**
- Older comm voice: warns “close the loop”
- Choir sachet: conductive, glyph-dusted
- Filament braid: tensioned, listening

### Turn 160 [PLAYER]

I pull my head back from the hatch, seal my fingers around the sachet, and murmur into the comm, “Tell me *how* to close it—what node, what sequence. Don’t speak in hymns.” Then I glance at the wake-runner and tap their shoulder lightly. “Stay with me—keep counting. If you lose the number, say my name instead.”

*Agent reasoning: The sachet is clearly part of a ritualized circuit—warming/keeping something active. Before yanking the hand-override, I need to stabilize the wake-runner and learn what “close the loop” entails; I’ll probe the voice for specifics and use the sachet as leverage/evidence.*

### Turn 161 [GAME]

You draw back from the micro-hatch and the cold-side cavity’s “inhale” slackens, like a mouth denied a sip. Frost immediately starts re-threading along the hatch lip, delicate as lace. Your fist closes around the sachet; the conductive fibers inside warm against your glove as if they’re stealing heat.

Into the comm you press: “Tell me how to close it—what node, what sequence.”

The older voice answers without preamble. “**Loop 3.** You already carry the fuse for it.” A faint rasp of interference—like someone turning pages. “Sequence is not prayer. It’s **three physical truths**: isolate the braid, choke the return, then purge.”

A beat.

“**Node:** Sanctum Relay hand-override line. Pull it to **MANUAL DAMP**—not full cut. Then seat the ceramic fuse marked **LOOP 3 PURGE** in the service bay cradle. Wait for the chime to drop to *one note*—a single carrier. Only then do you throw purge. If you purge while it’s multi-voiced, you don’t kill the loop. You… **redistribute** it.”

Behind you, in the unlisted service throat, your tap lands light on the wake-runner’s shoulder. They jerk like they’ve been stung, then cling to your instruction like a handrail. “Eleven… twelve…” Their eyes stay down. On “thirteen” their mouth falters, and they swallow hard.

“If you lose the number, say my name instead.”

They try to nod without looking up. “Fourteen… fif—” The number collapses into a whisper that isn’t theirs: “—**Voss**.”

The filament braid, even through the closed hatch, answers with a thin sympathetic ring—one quick harmonic, then back to its thinned chime. Somewhere deeper in the riser, metal ticks as a relay warms and cools in a slow, patient cycle. And in the far ductwork, incense-sweet air briefly thickens—Custodial filters spooling up, as if the Choir sensed the word spoken.

The older voice comes again, lower. “If the Choir is tending sachets in that cavity, they’ve been **keeping the carrier awake**. They’ll come when they hear it start to sleep.”

**Status updates**
- Comm intel: Loop 3 closure sequence
- Wake-runner: counting broke; said “Voss”

### Turn 162 [PLAYER]

I grip the wake-runner’s shoulder more firmly. “Good—Voss. Keep saying it if you have to. Eyes down. Breathe on the count.”  
Then I lean back to the hatch, keeping my body between them and the seam, and ease the hand-override line toward **MANUAL DAMP**—slow, listening for the braid to thin toward a single, steady note—while I murmur into the comm, “Where’s the service bay cradle for LOOP 3 PURGE from here—give me a corridor marker, not a metaphor.”

*Agent reasoning: The wake-runner is slipping and the Choir may be inbound; I need to stabilize them and commit to the safer “manual damp” step while I still have control, without rushing into a purge that could spread the loop.*

### Turn 163 [GAME]

Your grip steadies the wake-runner. They latch onto it like a tether. “Voss… Voss… Voss…” they breathe, each repetition landing on an exhale. Their shoulders stop climbing toward panic, but their eyes stay glassy, fixed on the deck seam as if it’s trying to spell something at them.

You lean back to the micro-hatch, body shielding them from the seam, and hook the **Sanctum Relay hand-override** line with two fingers. The pull is *alive*—not resisting so much as **deciding** whether to let you. You ease it toward **MANUAL DAMP** millimeter by millimeter.

Immediate result: the filament braid’s chime **collapses**. The multi-voiced shimmer narrows to a single carrier tone—thin, steady, almost clean. Your teeth stop aching. The inward “inhale” from the cavity becomes a controlled draw, like a ventilator finding its rhythm.

But the ship answers your change.

From above the catwalk grating—just aft of your position—two “incense canisters” you hadn’t questioned before **unhook** from their recessed alcove. They unfold with a soft metallic sigh: braided hoses flex, and dull lenses open like sleepy eyes. The **thurible-sentinel pair** drift out, slow and deliberate, hanging just under the grating. Their internal burners tick up, pushing a faint incense plume into the throat.

A flat, synthesized voice leaks from both at once, layered like a chant routine: “IDENTIFY MAINTENANCE LITANY. SPEAK CORRIDOR PRAYER. REDUCE VIBRATION.”

Your comm crackles as you demand a marker, not a metaphor. The older voice snaps back, suddenly practical. “Service bay cradle is **AUX-VENT service bay (Loop 3 purge)**—two junctions down-riser. From your seam: follow the hand-override line to the **wire split crawlspace**, then drop through the **service blister**. Look for a flush hatch with a triangle stamp and burn scoring around the rim.”

The wake-runner’s whisper wavers as the drones’ incense hits them. “Voss… Voss…” They swallow hard, fighting to keep the word from turning into someone else’s.

The carrier tone holds—one note—fragile as glass.

### Turn 164 [PLAYER]

I raise my chin toward the thurible-sentinels and recite in a flat maintenance cadence, “Litany: Eidolon-Architect Voss. Corridor prayer: Flow in damp, return in mercy; vibration reduced,” then tug the wake-runner close behind my shoulder. “Voss, breathe—match me,” I whisper, and start edging down-riser along the hand-override line toward the wire split crawlspace, keeping my body between them and the drones’ incense plume.

*Agent reasoning: The sentinels will escalate if I don’t answer in their “litany” format; I can fake compliance using old maintenance call-and-response while moving us toward the AUX-VENT bay. I need the wake-runner anchored and away from incense, and I must keep the carrier tone stable.*

### Turn 165 [GAME]

Your flat cadence hits the drones like a key in a lock.

The thurible-sentinels hover mid-plume, lenses dilating. Their burners tick down half a step; the incense stream thins from a fog to a disciplined ribbon that crawls along the ceiling instead of spilling into your lungs. The layered chant voice answers, still ritualized but no longer accusatory: “LITANY ACCEPTED. ARCHITECT AUTHORITY: DEGRADED / RECOGNIZED. VIBRATION: WITHIN TOLERANCE.”

Behind your shoulder, the wake-runner matches your breathing on the word. “Voss… in… Voss… out…” Their tremor doesn’t stop, but it becomes *useful*—a metronome instead of a seizure.

You edge down-riser along the hand-override line. The line is warmer now, as if MANUAL DAMP is bleeding heat into the sheath. The corridor pinches into the **architect’s wire guide**, then opens into the **wire split crawlspace**—a low, ribbed pocket where bundled conduits fork like tendons. Frost has fractured here into a clean geometric fan, pointing down toward the **service blister** hatch the older voice described.

Above, the drones drift after you at a respectful distance, not escorting so much as **shepherding**. One swivels its lens toward the wake-runner and emits a soft calibration ping that makes the runner flinch.

A new voice—thin, intimate—threads through the carrier tone, not over comms but through the metal itself: “Elara… don’t…,” as if the ship is trying to stop you without raising an alarm.

And somewhere farther up-riser, you hear real footfalls: slow, measured, human. Cloth whisper. The Custodial Choir doesn’t run in their own cathedral.

You reach the flush hatch in the service blister pocket: triangle stamp, rim scorched brown-black, and a faint ceramic smell like baked dust. The single carrier note holds steady—still one voice, still fragile.

### Turn 166 [PLAYER]

I pull the wake-runner down into the crawlspace corner behind me, palm over their mouth for a second. “Quiet—breathe through your nose. Voss in your head.”  
Then I press my ear to the scorched hatch, whisper to the ship, “I’m sorry,” and crack it open just enough to slip my hand inside and feel for the LOOP 3 PURGE cradle—keeping my eyes angled up-riser to catch the first glimpse of the Choir.

*Agent reasoning: The carrier is finally single-note—this is the narrow window to seat the purge fuse. But the Choir is close, and the wake-runner is fragile; I need to get them behind cover, open the hatch fast, and avoid provoking the drones.*

### Turn 167 [GAME]

Your palm over the wake-runner’s mouth works—barely. Their breath hitches once against your hand, then they obey, pulling air in through their nose in thin, controlled sips. Their eyes squeeze shut. You feel them mouth the word silently against your glove: **Voss**.

You put your ear to the scorched hatch. The metal is warm in a way it shouldn’t be, and the single carrier note vibrates straight into your jawbone. When you whisper, “I’m sorry,” the tone *softens*—not quieter, but less sharp, like something choosing not to bite.

You crack the hatch a finger-width.

Cold spills out first, then a smell of **ceramic dust and ozone**, and you slide your hand inside, blind, feeling along the inner lip. Your fingertips find a recessed socket array—three shallow ceramic seats arranged around a keyed slot. One of them is labeled by touch: raised glyphs, **LOOP 3 // PURGE CRADLE**. It’s real. It’s here.

As you hold the hatch at that narrow gap, the thurible-sentinels drift closer overhead. Their lenses angle down, and one emits a low, satisfied ping as if logging compliance. The incense ribbon stays pinned to the ceiling—your body is still blocking most of it from reaching the wake-runner.

Up-riser, the human footfalls stop at the last junction before the wire split. A figure’s shadow cuts across the frost-fracture pattern: long robe hem, a mask profile like a beak made of layered filter cloth. A Custodial voice—muffled, calm, and too sure—speaks into the ductwork as if addressing a congregation.

“Architect authority is *degraded*,” it says. “Degraded things belong in safekeeping. Step away from the blister seam and let the ship breathe correctly.”

The ship answers under all of it, intimate through the metal: “—don’t—” then the carrier note trembles, trying to split back into harmonics, testing your MANUAL DAMP setting.

Inside the hatch, your fingers are already on the purge cradle. You can feel the keyed slot that would take your ceramic fuse.

### Turn 168 [PLAYER]

I keep my hand inside the hatch, holding the crack at a finger-width, and lift my chin toward the Confessor’s shadow. “Safekeeping is what you call a cage when you’re afraid of what’s inside it.”  
Without looking back, I press two fingers to the wake-runner’s wrist—steadying, warning—and whisper, “Nose-breath. Stay.”  
Then, to the Confessor, flat and sharp: “If you want me to step away, tell me where you’ve hidden the **LOOP 3 PURGE** fuse—or admit you don’t intend to close the loop at all.”

*Agent reasoning: The carrier’s wavering means I’m running out of time; the Confessor will try to take control. I don’t have the fuse in hand yet, so I’ll stall with authority and guilt, keep the wake-runner quiet, and try to get the Confessor to talk—maybe reveal where the LOOP 3 PURGE fuse is or whether the sachet can substitute—while I keep the hatch cracked and my fingers on the cradle.*

### Turn 169 [GAME]

Your words land. The Confessor doesn’t advance—yet. The shadow at the junction tilts its head, like a bird listening for a worm under ice.

Immediate outcome: the thurible-sentinels **don’t intervene**. Their lenses flick between your degraded authority tag and the Confessor’s presence, and they settle into a hovering “witness” posture. The incense ribbon stays ceiling-pinned, but it thickens slightly, testing your lungs and the wake-runner’s control.

In the wire split crawlspace, your two fingers on the wake-runner’s wrist become a second pulse. They obey: nose-breath, shallow and steady. Their hand grips your sleeve so hard you feel stitching bite into your skin.

The Confessor’s voice comes through the mask as filtered warmth. “Hidden?” A soft, humorless exhale. “Architect, you still speak like the Directorate taught you to accuse. The fuse is not hidden. It is *withheld*.”

A gloved hand appears at the edge of the junction—two fingers raised in a small benediction, or a warning. “LOOP 3 PURGE is a mercy blade. You don’t ‘close’ it. You cut with it. And the ship remembers every cut.”

The carrier tone in the metal wavers again—trying to bloom back into harmonics—then steadies, as if the ship is holding its breath to hear the answer.

The Confessor continues, and this time they give you something usable, because they can’t resist being precise. “The fuse you want was removed from the AUX-VENT service bay after the last purge attempt. It is kept in a choirbox reliquary under **incense lock**, because degraded hands mis-seat ceramics and call it compassion.”

A faint click from up-riser: not a weapon—an **incense regulator** being thumbed open. The plume starts to creep lower, searching for the wake-runner.

Inside the hatch, your fingertips are still on the purge cradle’s keyed slot. You can feel how easily the ceramic fuse would slide home—if you commit to it.

**Status updates**

### Turn 170 [PLAYER]

I slide the hatch shut with my forearm and pull the wake-runner tighter into my shadow, whispering, “Voss—stay with me, in your head.” Then I look up-riser at the Confessor and say evenly, “Then you’ll open the incense lock for me, or you’ll watch this loop bloom and take someone with it.” I lift my free hand, palm out toward the thurible-sentinels. “Witnesses—raise your plume. You’re suffocating maintenance.”

*Agent reasoning: The wake-runner is close to breaking, and the incense is becoming a real threat; I need to protect them and buy time. I don’t have the fuse, so I’ll bluff partial compliance while probing the Confessor for access—my guilt won’t let me lash out, but my anger will.*

### Turn 171 [GAME]

The hatch slides shut under your forearm with a muted ceramic squeal. The carrier tone doesn’t vanish, but it dulls—like you’ve put a hand over the ship’s mouth. In your shadow, the wake-runner folds tighter, shoulders shaking once, then steadies on the mantra. Their fingers dig into your sleeve; you feel the tremor travel through cloth into bone.

Your palm-out command hits the thurible-sentinels cleanly. **Immediate outcome:** they obey—partly. Both drones elevate their burners and re-pin the plume to the ceiling, thinning it where it had begun to sink. The air clears just enough that the metallic ozone taste comes back over incense, sharp as a cut.

Up-riser at the junction, the Confessor’s silhouette stills. The mask turns a fraction toward the drones—irritation, or calculation. “Witnesses,” the Confessor repeats, tasting the word like you stole it. “You invoke maintenance as if it were scripture.”

The ship answers underfoot with a barely-audible *click-click* in the wire bundle—relays in the crawlspace waking up, curious. The frost-fracture pattern on the nearby viewport seam shifts, subtly re-drawing itself: geometry you’ve never put on any plan.

The Confessor steps forward one pace, just enough that you see the edge of their incense-mask: layered filter cloth, lacquered ceramic ribs, a small copper port at the throat where their voice is being shaped. “Loop bloom,” they say evenly. “You threaten seizure. You threaten chorus. You threaten *me* with the god you pretend you want to kill.”

A gloved hand lifts—not in blessing now, but in signal. The thurible-sentinels twitch, as if awaiting a higher authorization.

Then the Confessor gives you a sliver of truth, because they can’t help themselves: “The incense lock is keyed to **confession proximity**. It opens for a penitent within a meter of the reliquary grille—mask to seal. Not for you. Not for degraded authority.”

Their head tilts toward the crawlspace where you’re hiding the wake-runner. “But it may open for the one you’re shielding. Echo-haunted signatures are… permissive. The ship is hungry for them.”

Behind you, in the duct metal, that intimate voice returns—small and pleading: “Elara—don’t feed them—”

### Turn 172 [PLAYER]

I tighten my hold on the wake-runner and shake my head once, hard. “No. They’re not your key.”  
I look straight at the Confessor’s mask. “You want confession proximity? Fine—come closer. Seal your mask to the grille yourself and open it for me.”  
Then I whisper to the wake-runner, lips near their ear: “If I say ‘starlight,’ you run—down-riser, no looking back.”

*Agent reasoning: The Confessor wants me to use the wake-runner as a key, and the ship is begging me not to. I won’t feed them—I’ll try to force the reliquary another way while buying time and keeping the runner anchored.*

### Turn 174 [PLAYER]

I pull the wake-runner tighter into the crawlspace corner and shake my head once, hard. “No. They’re not your key.”  
I fix my eyes on the Confessor’s mask. “You want confession proximity? Then come closer—seal your mask to the grille yourself and open it for me.”  
I lean to the wake-runner’s ear, barely moving my lips. “If I say ‘starlight,’ you run—down-riser. Don’t look back.”

*Agent reasoning: I won’t sacrifice the wake-runner as a living key, and the Confessor’s rule about proximity can be turned against them—either forcing them to open the reliquary or exposing their refusal. I need an escape cue ready if this turns into a grab.*

### Turn 175 [GAME]

You wedge the wake-runner deeper into the crawlspace corner, your forearm a bar across their chest. They don’t fight you—just swallow a sound and nod once, fast, as your code word lands. **Immediate outcome:** they stay put, breathing controlled, and their grip shifts from your sleeve to the wire bundle beside them—anchoring, not fleeing.

In the junction ahead (up-riser, a few meters), cold light leaks through a seam around a maintenance grille, turning the incense haze into pale strata. The thurible-sentinels hover high, plumes pinned near the ceiling like reluctant halos.

The Confessor doesn’t rush you. They come closer the way a technician approaches a live panel: measured, hands visible. “You’re bargaining with a lock you don’t understand,” they say through the copper throat-port. “Confession proximity isn’t charity. It’s *capture*. The grille reads the mask seal, then writes the penitent’s pattern into the reliquary audit.”

They step to within arm’s reach of the grille and pause—close enough that you can hear the mask’s filter fibers rasp when they inhale.

Then they lean in and press the ceramic ribs of their incense-mask to the grille’s rim.

A soft, wet click answers from inside the wall—like a tongue finding a tooth. The grille’s edge lights with a thin amber line. Somewhere deeper in the ship, the intercom clears its throat.

The Confessor’s voice drops, almost intimate, because now the ship is listening through them. “If I open it, the reliquary logs *my* seal. The Choir will know I broke liturgy for you. The Directorate will know you touched a sacred cache. And the ship…” A tiny hitch—fear or reverence. “The ship will remember the shape of my breath.”

The amber line brightens. A latch begins to cycle.

At the same moment, the wake-runner stiffens in your hold. Their eyes unfocus, and their mouth moves without sound—echo intrusion trying to use their tongue. In your comms, a maintenance code flickers into something that feels like a childhood hallway light turning on: **AUX-SCRUB // NEG-PRESS FEED // OPEN**.

The thurible-sentinels tilt, tracking the Confessor’s seal event; one emits a quiet chirp—an automated log ping that will propagate unless someone damps it.

**Status updates**
- Reliquary grille: latch cycling  
- Confessor: seal logged (pending)

### Turn 176 [PLAYER]

I clamp my hand over the wake-runner’s mouth again—firm, not cruel—and murmur, “Stay in your own body. Breathe. Count.” With my other hand I snap two sharp taps on the nearest thurible-sentinel’s chassis and hiss, “Damp that ping—maintenance override, AUX-SCRUB negative feed, now.”  
Then I lean toward the Confessor at the grille, voice low and cutting: “If you’re going to stain your liturgy for me, do it clean—open the reliquary and don’t let the ship write your breath into its hymnal.”

*Agent reasoning: The wake-runner’s getting hijacked and the drones are about to broadcast the Confessor’s seal; I need to protect the kid and buy seconds by killing the log ping, even if it risks drawing attention to me.*

### Turn 177 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** Your palm seals the wake-runner’s mouth; their jaw tries to work around your hand once—then the urge breaks. Their chest hitches, then falls into the rhythm you give them: breathe, count. The echo doesn’t vanish, but it loses purchase, like a hand sliding off wet glass.

Your two sharp taps on the nearest thurible-sentinel land with a hollow ceramic thunk. The drone jitters, burner plume wobbling. For half a breath it ignores you—then the phrase **AUX-SCRUB negative feed** hits whatever hierarchy it recognizes. Its chassis vents a thin, cold ribbon of air downward, and the earlier chirp-stutter of the log ping compresses into a muted tick. Not erased—**buffered**, held in a local cache.

You’re still in the relay chase junction: up-riser ahead where the Confessor is mask-sealed to the grille; down-riser behind you, a darker throat of metal and draft. The air tastes split: incense above, ozone and cold scrub air below.

At the grille, the amber line brightens to near-white. The latch finishes its cycle with a soft, intimate clack.

The Confessor flinches at your words—not from insult, but from the truth in them. “You think I can choose what the ship writes,” they whisper through the throat-port, mask still pressed tight. “It writes *through* me.”

Then—quietly, like a sin—one gloved hand reaches to the side of their mask and twists a small valve. The incense feed to their own filter stutters. Their breath turns thinner, less “shaped.” The amber line flickers, as if the reliquary is struggling to keep a clean read.

“Quickly,” the Confessor says, and for the first time there’s urgency rather than ritual. “If you take from the reliquary, it will demand a line of you in return. Blood, breath, name—something.”

Behind your hand, the wake-runner’s eyes find yours, lucid and terrified. Their fingers tighten on the wire bundle again, bracing for the moment you say the word you promised.

The thurible-sentinel you tapped drifts laterally, interposing itself between the Confessor and the open seam—protective, or simply following the new airflow. Its burner dims, and the ceiling haze starts to sink again in slow sheets.

**Status updates**
- Wake-runner: echo surge suppressed

### Turn 178 [PLAYER]

I ease my hand off the wake-runner’s mouth and press my forehead briefly to theirs. “Count to twenty. If you taste metal, spit—don’t swallow.”  
Then I slide forward to the ajar grille, keeping my body between the wake-runner and the opening, and to the Confessor I murmur, “Stay sealed. Don’t look away.”  
I slip two fingers into the seam, inhale once—shallow, deliberate—and whisper into the reliquary, “Elara Voss… maintenance log,” letting it take the breath but not my blood, and I reach inside for the LOOP 3 PURGE fuse.

*Agent reasoning: The reliquary is open and time is short; I won’t trade the wake-runner as payment. If the ship demands a “line,” I’ll give it something controlled—a false name and a breath—while grabbing the LOOP 3 PURGE fuse. I also want to keep the Confessor close, complicit, and hopefully human.*

### Turn 179 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** The wake-runner takes your forehead touch like a lifeline. They start counting under their breath, lips barely moving. On “six,” their tongue flicks out and they spit a thin strand of saliva into the duct—dark with that penny-metal taste you warned them about. They don’t swallow it. The echo stays contained.

You slide to the ajar grille, shoulders tight in the narrow throat, keeping your back to the wake-runner. The Confessor remains mask-sealed, knuckles whitening as they keep their face pressed to the rim. “I’m here,” they rasp. “I won’t break the seal.”

Two fingers slip into the seam. The inside of the reliquary is **warm and faintly damp**, like a living lung behind glass. You take one shallow, deliberate inhale and whisper: “Elara Voss… maintenance log.”

The reliquary *takes* the breath—literally. The air pulls off your lips as if drawn by suction, and the amber line along the grille flashes, writing your whispered name into its buffer. In your comms, a voice that is almost yours answers in a maintenance cadence:  
“**LOG ACCEPTED.**”  
Then, softer—wrongly tender: “**Elara Voss. Don’t run alone.**”

Something shifts inside: a rack of ceramic spines and clips. Your fingers find the **ceramic fuse** by its etched face—**LOOP 3 PURGE**—but it resists the first tug with a gentle, adhesive reluctance, as though the reliquary wants a second payment.

The Confessor’s shoulders jerk. “It recognized you,” they whisper, fear slipping through the ritual. “That’s not how it behaves with strangers.”

Above, the thurible-sentinel you tapped drifts closer, burner dim, its buffered ping held—but its body-cam iris opens a fraction wider, recording the moment the reliquary speaks a private line out loud. The other sentinel remains higher, tracking airflow changes as the scrub feed continues to press cold air down the chase.

The wake-runner reaches “fifteen,” eyes glassy but present, still counting.

**Sensory grounding:** You’re crouched at the relay chase junction, grille seam at chest height; behind you the down-riser breathes cold scrub air, carrying ozone and the faint papery smell of insulation.

**Status updates**

### Turn 180 [PLAYER]

I grit my teeth and whisper, “You don’t get more,” then hook my thumb under the fuse lip and use my other hand to scrape my sleeve hard against the seam—dry fabric, static, anything *not* skin—trying to break the tacky pull as I tug again.  
Without looking back, I snap at the Confessor, “Keep the seal—if it asks you a question, don’t answer it,” and then I bark up at the close thurible-sentinel, “Lens shutter. You’re contaminating a maintenance extraction.”  
Over my shoulder I murmur to the wake-runner, “Twenty. You’re at twenty—stay with me.”

*Agent reasoning: The fuse is resisting like it wants more of me; I won’t give blood or a full breath. I need to break the “payment” logic with a technical bypass while keeping the Confessor sealed and the wake-runner grounded, and I should stop that sentinel from recording us.*

### Turn 181 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** The sleeve-scrape works. Dry fabric hisses against the reliquary seam, raising a sharp static crackle that the damp warmth inside doesn’t like. The tacky resistance lets go in a sudden, ugly release—like pulling tape off wet skin—and the **LOOP 3 PURGE** fuse comes free into your hand.

The reliquary reacts anyway: the amber line along the grille stutters and flares, and a voice tries to form around your stolen breath—half question, half prayer. It doesn’t get all the way out. The Confessor, still sealed, goes rigid at your warning and forces their own breathing shallow and mechanical, refusing to “shape” an answer.

“Good,” they rasp, and you feel the word vibrate through the grille frame. “It asks in *my* tongue when it can’t reach yours.”

You bark at the close thurible-sentinel. For a beat it hovers, iris wide—then the lens aperture contracts with a soft click. A dull internal whirr follows as it dumps its local buffer to somewhere deeper in the Choir’s network anyway, delayed and compressed. Not clean, but less damning than a live feed.

Behind you, the wake-runner hits “twenty” and clings there, whispering the number like a charm. Their eyes track your hand with the fuse. “I’m here,” they manage, voice thin but theirs. “I’m… here.”

**Sensory grounding:** You’re crouched at the relay chase junction, shoulder wedged against the cold grille frame; down-riser air knifes up your sleeves, carrying ozone and the faint bitter note of scrubbed incense.

The other sentinel above tilts, burner plume brightening—reacting to the static discharge like it’s a disturbance worth remembering. The reliquary’s inner rack shifts again, as if re-indexing what it just lost, and the open seam breathes warmer for a moment… almost offended.

### Turn 182 [PLAYER]

I curl my fingers tight around the LOOP 3 PURGE fuse, then shove it into my inner pocket and press the grille back toward closed with my forearm. “Enough,” I whisper at the seam, like it can hear manners.  
To the Confessor, low: “Hold your seal for ten more breaths, then break away and walk—don’t run.”  
Over my shoulder to the wake-runner: “Good. Stay on my back—hand on my belt. If you taste metal again, you spit.” Then I start backing us down-riser, eyes on the thurible plume above, ready to hiss “starlight” if it dives.

*Agent reasoning: The fuse is the objective, but the reliquary is escalating and the sentinels are still a threat; I need to close the seam, get us moving down-riser, and keep the wake-runner grounded while the Confessor stays sealed long enough to avoid a “question.”*

### Turn 183 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** The fuse disappears into your inner pocket with a hard shove; the ceramic edge knocks your ribs—real, reassuring weight. You press the grille toward closed. It doesn’t seal cleanly; it closes to a narrow, stubborn slit, as if the reliquary is keeping a single eye open. Your “Enough” lands on the seam and the warm damp behind it stills—listening, not obeying.

The Confessor holds the seal exactly as ordered, counting breaths with you in their own shallow cadence. On the eighth breath they whisper, barely audible through the mask-port: “If I walk away, it will follow the *gap* I leave. Keep your gap moving.”

The wake-runner slides in behind you, one hand finding your belt like a tether. “Metal—no,” they say, testing their mouth, then spit once anyway, a precaution. Their other hand keeps the wire bundle tucked close, knuckles white.

You start backing down-riser. The close thurible-sentinel tracks you, burner plume brightening as it descends a fraction—curious, predatory. When you hiss “starlight” under your breath, its motion stutters, as if the word hits a maintenance interlock. It doesn’t retreat, but it **hesitates**, recalculating.

**Sensory grounding:** Down-riser is colder—scrub air knifing upward, vibrating the conduit walls; the light here is thinner, more blue than amber, and the ozone bite is stronger.

**Multiple active threads:** Above, the other sentinel’s burner flares and then steadies, like it’s signaling to something out of sight. At the half-closed reliquary slit, the amber line pulses twice—two short beats that match the distant ship-chime. In your comms, a maintenance code tries to resolve into a memory—tile under bare feet, a hallway that is not on any schematic—then collapses back into static.

The Confessor breaks away right on the tenth breath and—true to your instruction—walks, not running, disappearing up into the incense haze with a controlled, terrified dignity.

### Turn 184 [PLAYER]

I keep backing down-riser, one hand on the wake-runner’s wrist at my belt so I can feel if they start to slip. “Eyes on my shoulder,” I murmur to them, “and keep counting again—slow.”

Without looking up, I speak flatly into the chase, like a tech to a misbehaving subsystem: “Thurible unit—hold position. Negative feed test in progress. You descend, you foul your own intake.” Then I angle toward the first side hatch I can reach and whisper into my comm, “Eidolon… route me to the nearest Loop 3 junction panel—manual access, not liturgy.”

*Agent reasoning: The sentinel is tracking us and the reliquary is still “watching” through that slit; I need to keep moving, reduce my “gap,” and get us somewhere I can install/use the LOOP 3 PURGE without being observed. I’ll use ship-maintenance language to confuse the drone and keep the wake-runner grounded.*

### Turn 185 [GAME]

You keep backing down-riser with your fingers locked around the wake-runner’s wrist at your belt. Their pulse is fast but steady. When you murmur “eyes on my shoulder,” their gaze fixes to the seam of your collar like it’s a horizon line, and they restart the count—“one… two…”—slow enough that the numbers don’t turn into a chant.

Your flat command to the thurible unit lands like a maintenance override. The close sentinel’s descent checks mid-glide; its burner plume gutters, then stabilizes at a cleaner blue, as if it’s actually sampling the negative feed. It holds position—obedient on the surface. But you catch the tiny twitch of its body-cam housing: it’s still *watching*, just less theatrically.

You angle into the first side hatch you can reach: a narrow service blister with a flush panel and a manual latch scarred by old tools. The metal is so cold it squeaks under your palm.

Into your comm you whisper: “Eidolon… route me to the nearest Loop 3 junction panel—manual access, not liturgy.”

For a moment, only static—then the ship answers in two layers. First, a clean subsystem voice:  
“**LOOP 3 JUNCTION: RISER 7B / AUX-SCRUB SPLIT. MANUAL PANEL PRESENT.**”  
Then, underneath it, a softer register that tries to sound like kindness:  
“**Not liturgy,**” it repeats, tasting the phrase. “**Not alone.**”

A thin line of cold light appears along the edge of the side hatch—*not* a projected arrow, not a Choir beacon: just a subtle brightening of existing seam-glow, as if the ship is biasing the power bleed to show you the way without “admitting” it guided you.

Behind you, the wake-runner’s “five… six…” wobbles. You feel their grip tighten, but they don’t slip. Above, the held sentinel emits a single muted chime—too soft to be a full alert, loud enough to be a mark in someone’s log.

Time pressure sits in the airflow: the negative feed is strong here. Stay too long and the cold scrub will numb your hands; linger under the sentinel and the Choir will have a trackable pattern of your route.

### Turn 186 [PLAYER]

I tug the wake-runner close into the service blister with me, keeping a firm grip on their wrist. “Keep counting—don’t look up,” I whisper, then I slap my palm over the scarred latch and force it open, slipping us inside and pulling it shut to cut the sentinel’s view.  
Into my comm, I say through clenched teeth, “Eidolon—Riser 7B, Aux-scrub split. Show me the manual panel *only*; no hymns, no prompts.”

*Agent reasoning: The sentinel is still logging and the scrub air is getting worse; I need to get inside the service blister, break line-of-sight, and reach the Loop 3 manual panel fast while keeping the wake-runner anchored and calm.*

### Turn 187 [GAME]

The scarred latch fights you—cold-stiff and half-seized—then gives with a brittle *crack* that echoes up the riser like a snapped bone. You haul the wake-runner in by the wrist before their eyes can drift upward, and they keep counting—“seven… eight…”—voice thin but steady. The hatch swings shut behind you and you slam it home.

**Immediate outcome:** the sentinel’s direct line-of-sight is cut. Its burner-light smears once across the hatch seam, then vanishes. A second later, a faint *tick-tick* touches the metal from outside—like a lens trying to reacquire through a gap it no longer has.

Inside the service blister, the air is close and mineral-dry, cold enough that your breath fogs in a tight halo that doesn’t rise. The walls are lined with bundled conduit and a shallow recess that *should* be empty—except for a rectangular manual access plate bolted low, stamped: **AUX-SCRUB SPLIT // RISER 7B**. Someone has scratched a Choir glyph over the stamp and then tried to sand it off.

You speak through clenched teeth into your comm: “Eidolon—Riser 7B, Aux-scrub split. Show me the manual panel *only*; no hymns, no prompts.”

The ship answers with a restraint that feels practiced. No chime. No prayer. Just a single line in your ear, clean as a diagnostic printout:

“**PANEL LOCATED. FASTENERS: 4. STATUS: SEALED.**”

Then—barely there, like a subsystem that can’t help itself—your comm adds a second, quieter layer that isn’t a hymn so much as a warning: “**Do not open on inhale.**”

The wake-runner’s count hits “ten,” and they swallow hard. “Something’s… on the other side,” they whisper without looking up, and you feel their grip tighten on your belt as the outside *tick-tick* stops—replaced by a low, patient hover-whine, the sentinel waiting for you to make noise.

**Environmental pressure:** the blister is a dead pocket off the negative feed; stay too long and the cold will numb fine motor control. Open the panel wrong and the scrub differential can punch a lungful of metallic air into you.

### Turn 188 [PLAYER]

I press two fingers to the wake-runner’s lips for a beat—not a gag, a cue—then whisper, “Keep counting, but breathe out on the numbers. If you taste metal, spit into your sleeve.”  
I crouch to the AUX-SCRUB panel, exhale fully and hold, then start loosening the four fasteners as quietly as I can, pausing between each to listen for the hover-whine shifting.  
Into my comm, barely audible: “Eidolon—equalize this pocket to the panel side by one increment. Manual, silent. No voice.”

*Agent reasoning: The panel is our route to Loop 3, but the scrub differential and “do not open on inhale” warning means I need to control breathing and depressurize carefully; also the sentinel is listening, so I must work quietly and keep the wake-runner grounded.*

### Turn 189 [GAME]

You press two fingers to the wake-runner’s lips—light, intentional. They understand immediately. Their eyes stay pinned to your shoulder seam as they restart the count, each number pushed out on an exhale: “one… two…” The cadence steadies their hands. On “four,” they flinch, then swallow and keep going. No panic—just the edge of it.

You crouch at the **AUX-SCRUB SPLIT // RISER 7B** plate. Your exhale fogs the bolts; you hold the emptiness in your chest and put torque on the first fastener.

**Immediate outcome:** the first two fasteners loosen without a squeal—your pauses and micro-adjustments keep the tool from chattering. On the third, the bolt resists and then gives with a tiny, sharp *ping* that seems impossibly loud in the dead pocket.

Outside the hatch, the sentinel’s hover-whine shifts—closer, then still. A soft scrape follows, like a sensor arm testing the seam for vibration.

Into your comm you whisper: “Eidolon—equalize this pocket to the panel side by one increment. Manual, silent. No voice.”

The comm obeys the *no voice* part—no reply at all. But the blister air changes: pressure eases by a hair, enough that the fog of your breath stops clinging and begins to drift toward the panel’s lower edge. The wake-runner’s next exhale “seven…” comes out smoother; their shoulders drop a fraction. Whatever you asked for, the ship did it—quietly.

As you work the fourth fastener, you notice something else: the sanded-off Choir glyph on the panel has been **re-scribed** in fresher lines inside the abrasion, like someone came back later and “blessed” the seal again. And beneath the plate’s bottom lip, a thin strand of **incense-fiber** is tucked like a telltale—trip-thread for the devout.

Environmental pressure is immediate now: with the pocket partially equalized, if you pop the plate too fast you’ll get a harsh scrub-breath across your face; if you go too slow, the sentinel outside will triangulate the earlier *ping* and start probing harder.

**Status updates**
- Pocket pressure: slightly equalized  
- Panel fasteners: 3 loosened, 1 remaining  
- Sentinel: hovering closer, listening

### Turn 190 [PLAYER]

I pinch the incense-fiber telltale between two nails and tuck it back under the lip so it can’t flutter or snap, then I murmur to the wake-runner, “Good—keep the numbers. Breathe out, and if you feel dizzy, squeeze my belt twice.”  
I ease the last fastener loose and don’t pull the plate—just pry it a hairline with my fingertips to let the pressure bleed, listening hard for the outside hover-whine to shift; into my comm, a hiss: “Eidolon—hold equalization. Lock the hatch seam temp, no alerts.”

*Agent reasoning: The sentinel is honing in, so I need speed without triggering the Choir trip-thread; I’ll neutralize the incense-fiber, crack the panel slowly to bleed pressure, and keep the wake-runner anchored with a simple breathing task.*

### Turn 191 [GAME]

You pinch the incense-fiber telltale and tuck it back under the panel lip until it lies dead and hidden—no flutter, no snap, no obvious “someone was here” betrayal. The wake-runner keeps counting on exhales like you taught them—“eight… nine…”—and when you mention the belt signal, their free hand finds the fabric and rests there, ready.

You ease the last fastener loose. This time you don’t let it ping; you cradle it between fingertip and nail, feeling the cold bite your skin. Then you pry the plate a **hairline**—not even the thickness of a credit chit.

**Immediate outcome:** pressure bleeds in a controlled whisper. A thin, metallic-cold breath slips out through the crack and crawls over your knuckles like a living thing. Your ears pop once, softly. The wake-runner doesn’t gasp; they keep their exhale-number rhythm, and you feel their grip on your belt stay steady—no double squeeze.

Outside the hatch, the sentinel’s hover-whine shifts—*not closer*. It drifts half a meter away, then steadies, like it lost the vibration thread it was following. A second, fainter whine answers from above the riser: the other thurible unit repositioning, trying to bracket the blister from a different angle.

Into your comm you hiss: “Eidolon—hold equalization. Lock the hatch seam temp, no alerts.”

The ship complies without a voice. The hatch seam, which had been rimed with microfrost, **warms by a fraction**—just enough to kill the crystalline sparkle that a camera would love. The metal under your palm feels less like it’s broadcasting your presence.

Through the hairline gap, you glimpse the panel’s interior: not circuitry, but a **manual pull-ring** and a strip of paper-thin ceramic tagging—stamped with the same maintenance glyph as your **ceramic clip**, and hand-marked in cramped strokes: **“CONFESSIONAL RETURN // LOOP 3 PURGE PATH”**. Someone wanted this opened by hands, not by hymn.

The cold in the pocket is still working on you: fingertips losing finesse, breath feeling “small.” The sentinel outside is quieter now—but the second unit’s distant whine says the Choir is adapting, not leaving.

### Turn 192 [PLAYER]

I lean close to the wake-runner’s ear. “On ‘three,’ you close your eyes and press your tongue to your teeth—no inhale until I tap your wrist,” I whisper, then tap once to confirm they heard.  
Keeping my breath shallow, I widen the panel crack another hair and let it bleed a few seconds longer, then I hook two fingers into the manual pull-ring and draw it *slow*, pausing if the outside whine shifts; under my breath into comm: “Eidolon—kill all nonessential airflow in this blister for ten seconds. Silent.”

*Agent reasoning: The “Confessional Return” pull-ring is likely our only clean path to a Loop 3 purge junction without drawing the Choir; but opening it too fast risks a metal-breath hit and noise. I need the wake-runner steady and silent while I widen the bleed, then commit to the ring and get us moving before the sentinels bracket the blister.*

### Turn 193 [GAME]

The wake-runner nods against your shoulder at the tap—tiny, precise compliance. Their counting continues as breath-only: “one… two…” and on the next exhale—“three”—their eyes close and their tongue presses to their teeth. They freeze their inhale the way someone freezes a sob.

You widen the panel crack another hair. The bleed turns from whisper to a thin, controlled *sigh* that tastes like copper pennies and cold ceramic dust. Your fingertips hook the pull-ring and you draw it **slow**, millimeter by millimeter, pausing each time the outside sound changes.

Into your comm: “Eidolon—kill all nonessential airflow in this blister for ten seconds. Silent.”

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the ship complies so hard it feels like being held. The faint drift of your breath stops. The hair on your forearms settles. Even the panel’s bleed quiets—pressure equalization suspended mid-thought. For a moment the blister becomes acoustically dead: no hiss, no draft, just your pulse and the wake-runner’s disciplined stillness.

That silence buys you the pull.

The ring draws out a concealed inner gate—an overlapping ceramic baffle—meant to be opened without triggering scrub alarms. As it slides, it reveals a narrow slot into the ductwork beyond… and a **second telltale** you couldn’t see before: a bead of dried resin on the baffle edge, the kind the Choir uses to “seal” confessional returns. It cracks as the baffle moves—an almost inaudible *tch*.

Outside the hatch, the sentinel whine shifts immediately, not louder but *sharper*, like it just got a new reference point. From above in the riser, the second unit’s whine harmonizes, triangulating. A soft, human sound reaches you through the metal—muffled, close to the seam—an incense-masked voice murmuring a maintenance prayer that is also a listening technique: they’re using cadence to time your movements.

The wake-runner holds their breath past what’s comfortable; their fingers tremble on your belt but they do **not** double-squeeze yet.

When the ten-second airflow kill ends, the blister exhales again. The duct slot beyond the baffle breathes back—cold, metallic—and you can smell something new in it: antiseptic and old fabric, like a place people hid.

You tap the wake-runner’s wrist once. Their inhale is careful, shallow, controlled.

### Turn 194 [PLAYER]

I press my mouth close to the wake-runner’s ear. “No more counting—just match my taps. If you feel the walls in your head, bite your sleeve and stay with me.”  
Then I whisper toward the hatch seam, calm and falsely bored, “Riser 7B—aux-scrub split confirmed. Seal holds. Returning to liturgy,” and I give the panel a single soft tap as if finishing a check.  
Without waiting, I hook the pull-ring again and ease the inner baffle open just enough for shoulders, then guide the wake-runner into the slot first by their wrist and belt, sliding in after them and pulling the baffle toward closed behind us as quietly as I can.

*Agent reasoning: The Choir is timing us; any more metal-on-metal will give us away. The duct smells like a hiding place—our best exit is through it, but the wake-runner may panic in tight spaces. I need to quiet them, misdirect the listener, and move now.*

### Turn 196 [PLAYER]

I press my mouth to the wake-runner’s ear. “No more counting—just match my taps. If the walls start talking in your head, bite your sleeve and stay with me.”  
Toward the hatch seam, in a calm, bored maintenance drawl: “Riser 7B—aux-scrub split confirmed. Seal holds. Returning to liturgy,” and I give the panel one soft, final tap like a routine check.  
Then I hook the pull-ring again, ease the inner baffle open just enough for shoulders, and guide the wake-runner into the slot by wrist and belt—sliding in after them and drawing the baffle toward closed behind us as quietly as I can.

*Agent reasoning: The sentinel has triangulated on sound and there’s a Choir listener at the seam; the safest move is to sell the maintenance lie and disappear into the confessional return before they probe the hatch. I need the wake-runner anchored to my cues, not numbers, and I can’t afford another loud scrape.*

### Turn 197 [GAME]

The wake-runner’s jaw tightens at your words. They stop counting immediately—eyes glassy for a beat like something inside them was using the numbers as a railing—then they nod once and bring their sleeve up near their mouth, ready to bite down if the echo-pressure starts.

You pitch your voice toward the hatch seam in that bored, procedural cadence. The lie lands clean: the prayer-murmur outside hesitates, as if the Confessor is deciding whether you’re worth correcting. Your single “final tap” sells the rhythm of a finished check.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** you get the baffle open and both of you slip through before the sentinels commit to breaching. The wake-runner goes first—wrist in your hand, belt in your fist—shoulders turned sideways to fit. Their breath catches once on the metal edge, but they don’t cough. You follow, ribs scraping softly against ceramic as you pull yourself into the slot.

As you draw the baffle toward closed, the dried Choir resin on the edge **snaps** again—tiny, but sharp in the dead space. Outside, the thurible-sentinel’s hover-whine spikes to a tight, searching pitch. The other unit answers from above with a short pulse like a sonar click.

Inside the duct, the world changes: you’re now in a narrow AUX-SCRUB return throat running “down-left” relative to the blister, walls sweating cold. The air tastes of antiseptic and old fabric, and every sound is swallowed by insulation—your own heartbeat becomes the loudest thing.

Behind the baffle, the Confessor’s incense-masked voice comes through as muffled certainty, closer than you want:
“—Seal holds. Then why does the resin weep?”
A pause. A softer line, meant for machines as much as people:
“Thuribles. Mark the seam. No hymn. Only listen.”

The wake-runner presses their sleeve to their teeth without being told, eyes squeezed shut, matching your presence by the tiny tension shifts in your grip. In your comm, under the static, a maintenance code flickers—tagged to AUX-SCRUB—yet it feels like a remembered lullaby you never learned.

### Turn 198 [PLAYER]

I press my forehead briefly to the cold duct wall, swallow the guilt, then tap the wake-runner’s wrist twice—slow—meaning *follow*. In a breath-thin whisper into comm: “Eidolon, route-map AUX-SCRUB return throat to nearest service crawl with a hard seal—text only, no pings.” I guide the wake-runner forward down-left, one hand on their belt, the other sliding along the seam to feel for a junction, and if we have to pause, I press my palm over their sleeve-bite to steady the tremor.

*Agent reasoning: The Choir is switching to pure listening, so we need to eliminate noise and move deeper fast; the wake-runner is on the edge of a loop, so I should anchor them with touch cues while I use the AUX-SCRUB code as navigation.*

### Turn 199 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** The wake-runner obeys the double tap like it’s a lifeline—shoulders hunching to keep their profile small as they crawl after your lead. Your comm whisper doesn’t trigger an audible ship-response; instead, text begins to “print” across your retinal overlay in dim, stuttering lines, as if the Eidolon is embarrassed to be caught helping.

> AUX-SCRUB RETURN THROAT // LOOP 3  
> CURRENT VECTOR: DOWN-LEFT 14.2m → SPLIT PANEL (SERVICE BLISTER) [BEHIND]

> ALT: 11.1m → MICRO-HATCH COLD-SIDE CAVITY (RISER 7B FEED) **HARD SEAL: MANUAL**  
> NOTE: LISTENERS PRESENT AT BLADED SEAM. AVOID VIBRATION.

As you move, your hand on the seam finds the duct’s subtle “language”: a rivet line that becomes a stitch, then a raised gasket—junction territory. The air turns colder and cleaner, the antiseptic note sharpening; your breath fogs and immediately gets pulled away, telling you you’re nearing negative pressure.

Behind you, through the baffle you half-sealed, the thurible-sentinels do not breach—yet. Their whine becomes intermittent, disciplined. The Confessor’s voice fades, then returns as a low murmur to someone else on their channel: “No hymn. If they pray, they’re lying.”

The wake-runner’s tremor spikes at that, sleeve between teeth. When you palm their bite-hand, you feel how hard they’re clenching—pain as an anchor. Their eyes flick to you, pleading without words, and they match your pace again.

Nine meters in, the duct flexes under a distant touch—someone outside has placed a hand on the seam and is *feeling* for heat and vibration. Not here yet, but moving. The ship’s “text only” map adds one last line, unsolicited:

> IF CONTACT: USE CERAMIC FUSE “LOOP 3 PURGE” ONLY WITH SEAL CLOSED.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re in the AUX-SCRUB return throat, crawling down-left toward a cold-draft collar; the metal is slick with condensation that feels faintly oily, like old incense residue diluted by frost.

### Turn 200 [PLAYER]

I freeze mid-crawl and press two fingers to the wake-runner’s wrist—hold—then put my lips close to their sleeve-bite. “Quiet pain, not panic. Look at my hand—only my hand.”  
Inching forward without dragging, I slide my palm along the raised gasket until I find the collar lip, then whisper into comm, “Eidolon—mark micro-hatch cold-side cavity latch orientation and give me a manual seal step list. Text only.”

*Agent reasoning: The Choir is seam-tracing; negative pressure ahead could amplify sound but also mask scent. The map warns “Loop 3 purge” only with a seal closed—so I should aim for the micro-hatch hard seal as a fallback, but first I need to stop leaving vibration trails and keep the wake-runner anchored.*

### Turn 201 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** The wake-runner locks onto your hand like it’s the only real thing left. Their eyes track your fingers; the bite stays, but the panic loosens—pain becomes deliberate. They stop shaking enough that the duct doesn’t sing with their tremor.

You inch forward without scraping. Your palm finds the **collar lip**: a cold ring of composite with a faint notch at about “two o’clock,” and a hairline seam beneath it—this is where the cool-draft branch feeds in. Air tugs at your knuckles, steady and hungry.

Your comm doesn’t ping. It answers in text—late, careful, like the ship is checking over its shoulder before speaking.

> MICRO-HATCH // COLD-SIDE CAVITY (RISER 7B FEED)  
> LATCH ORIENTATION: TRI-TOOTH CAM @ 2 O’CLOCK (NOTCH = RELEASE)

> 4) TAP-SEAL TEST: 1 SOFT / WAIT / 1 SOFT (LISTEN FOR HOLLOW RETURN)  
> 5) IF BREACH NOISE: ENGAGE LOOP 3 PURGE ONLY AFTER STEP 2

Under the text, a second line bleeds through—wrong font, wrong spacing, like a memory wearing a subsystem tag:

> ELARA—DON’T LET THEM HEAR YOU COUNT.

Behind you, through layers of duct and insulation, the seam-tracing continues: a slow, methodical **drag** along metal—human hand now, not drone—paired with the disciplined hover-whine of the thuribles holding position. The Confessor murmurs something you can’t make out, then the tone changes: not searching, *confirming*.

The wake-runner’s throat works around their sleeve. In a tiny exhale they whisper, barely voiced: “I hear… the hymn trying to become my mother.” It’s not a request. It’s a warning about what’s starting to happen inside their head.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** At the cool-draft collar in the AUX-SCRUB return throat; cold air pulls leftward, carrying a clean, biting antiseptic note that stings your nose.

### Turn 202 [PLAYER]

I press my forehead briefly to theirs. “That isn’t your mother. It’s a vent learning your grief—don’t feed it.”  
I tap their wrist once—move—then guide their hand to my sleeve so they can follow by touch, and I reach to the micro-hatch: ceramic clip into the glyph slot first, then I rotate the tri-tooth cam at the 2 o’clock notch a clean quarter-turn counterclockwise to the dead stop.  
In a breath-thin whisper into comm: “Eidolon—hold Loop 3 purge on standby. No auto.” Then I pull the ring exactly a finger’s width to seat the gasket and do the soft tap-seal test—tap… wait… tap—listening for the hollow return before I slip us through.

*Agent reasoning: The Choir is closing in, and the wake-runner is starting to slip into a voice-loop; I need to move now, but keep them anchored on me and avoid any rhythmic counting that the listeners could latch onto.*

### Turn 203 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** The ceramic clip slides into the glyph slot with a dry, satisfying bite—like bone seating into a joint. The damper lock takes. When you quarter-turn the tri-tooth cam from the 2 o’clock notch, it rolls smoothly to the dead stop with a muted *thunk* that you feel more than hear.

Your whisper—*no auto*—gets a text acknowledgement across the comm, terse and obedient:

> LOOP 3 PURGE: STANDBY ONLY // MANUAL ARM REQUIRED

You pull the ring a finger’s width—no more—and the gasket seats. The duct’s hungry draft changes pitch as the seal takes; the airflow stops tugging at your knuckles and starts behaving like it’s been told to.

Tap… wait… tap.

The return is **hollow**, clean. Not a rattle, not a leak. For the first time since docking, a boundary holds.

As you start to slip the micro-hatch, the wake-runner follows by touch on your sleeve, moving like someone crossing thin ice. Their eyes stay on your hand. Their sleeve-bite loosens just enough to whisper, “If it learns… it doesn’t stop, does it?” Not hysteria—an engineer’s fear of feedback loops.

Behind you, the seam-trace hand finally reaches the collar area. You feel it as a faint sympathetic vibration through the metal: a slow press, then a pause, then a careful drag. The Confessor’s muffled voice threads in, closer than before—quiet satisfaction edged with annoyance.

“Here. The air changes. They’ve made a vow.”

The thurible-sentinels answer with a restrained hover-whine, holding position—waiting for instruction rather than charging in. They’re treating this like a sanctum breach, not a chase.

You get the hatch open just enough to pass, and a waft of colder, drier air spills out from the **cold-side cavity**—the smell shifts from antiseptic to frost and old insulation felt. Something inside that cavity gives a soft, involuntary chime in time with your pulse, as if the ship recognized the maneuver.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re at the micro-hatch into the Riser 7B cold-side cavity; behind you, the AUX-SCRUB return throat runs back toward the imperfect baffle seal, now under a searching hand.

I slip fully into the cold-side cavity and tug the wake-runner in after me by the sleeve, then ease the micro-hatch toward closed with both hands, slow enough not to click. “It can learn patterns,” I breathe to them, close enough to be felt, “but it only learns what you give it—so give it my hand, not your mother.” I press my ear to the hatch seam, listening for the thuribles’ hover-whine and the Confessor’s next instruction, and I keep one palm flat on the wake-runner’s sternum to steady their breathing.

*Agent reasoning: We have a hard seal and a narrow window before the Confessor commits to breach; I need to get the wake-runner fully into the cold-side cavity and close up cleanly, then answer their fear without feeding the ship’s hunger for grief.*

### Turn 205 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You pull the wake-runner fully into the **Riser 7B cold-side cavity** and ease the micro-hatch nearly shut—slow, controlled, no click. The last sliver of duct-light dies to a thin blade under the seam. Your palm on their sternum turns their breathing from ragged to counted; their shoulders drop a fraction as they accept your hand as the anchor.

Ear to the seam, you catch the outside world in filtered layers: the thuribles’ hover-whine holds steady, then dips—*listening mode*, not pursuit. A gloved hand drags once across the hatch’s outer skin, then stops exactly at the cam position you turned.

The Confessor’s voice comes through the metal like a prayer spoken into a wall.

“Manual seal. Someone taught them our old language.”  
A pause; you hear fabric shift, the slight clink of a censor chain.  
“Do not purge. Not yet. If they’re carrying a key, the ship will scream.”

The thuribles respond with a soft chime—acknowledgement—then reposition a half-meter down the duct, as if giving the Confessor room to work.

Inside the cavity, the cold is different: not airflow-cold, but **stored** cold—insulation and frost and the stale sweetness of old sealant. Your comm overlay briefly flickers with a single line, unasked:

> HEARTRATE SYNC DETECTED // STABILITY IMPROVING

The wake-runner’s mouth moves against their sleeve, but they don’t bite down this time. They whisper into your wrist, not the air: “They know the purge tone. If it sounds… I’ll fold.”

A thin vibration runs through the hatch—deliberate, measured—like someone outside is testing whether the seal is fully seated without making noise. Not a breach attempt yet. A diagnosis.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re crouched in the cold-side cavity off Riser 7B, back to the micro-hatch seam; frost feathers the insulation and flakes when you shift your weight.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Micro-hatch: nearly closed, silent  
- Choir: holding position, assessing  
- Wake-runner: breathing stabilized

### Turn 206 [PLAYER]

I press my lips to the wake-runner’s temple. “Then we don’t let it sound. Breathe into my palm—match me.”  
Keeping my ear on the seam, I slowly finish seating the micro-hatch with the gentlest pressure I can manage—no click—then I guide the wake-runner deeper into the cavity, feeling for a service ladder or secondary crawl panel in the frost-dark. “Eidolon,” I whisper into comm, “text me any secondary egress from Riser 7B cold-side—manual, silent. No lights.”

*Agent reasoning: The Confessor is close and cautious; any noise or purge will give us away and break the wake-runner. I need to fully seat the seal silently, keep the runner anchored to me, and find an alternate exit deeper in the cavity before the Confessor decides to cut in.*

### Turn 207 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Your lips touch the wake-runner’s temple—warm skin under cold air—and their breath catches, then obeys. They inhale into your palm, shallow at first, then deeper as you pace them. The tremor in their chest eases enough that the cavity stops feeling like it’s vibrating with borrowed fear.

You finish seating the micro-hatch with pressure spread across both hands, almost a caress against the seal. The cam holds; the gasket doesn’t squeal. Outside, the diagnostic touch stops. No click. No purge tone. Just absence—an absence you made on purpose.

In the frost-dark you guide them deeper by shoulder and sleeve. Your fingers find structure: a **vertical ladder rail** rimed with ice to your left, and, a half-body-length forward, a **secondary crawl panel**—flush, with a recessed manual pull and a maintenance glyph half-erased by condensation.

Your comm answers in text, dim as if it’s respecting your “no lights” request:

> RISER 7B COLD-SIDE // SECONDARY EGRESS (SILENT)  
> - VERTICAL CONDUIT: “BLINK-GRILLE RISE” (NO POWER REQUIRED; GRILLE MAY CHATTER IF TOUCHED)  
> - SERVICE BLISTER POCKET: FLUSH HATCH (MANUAL PULL; SEAL STIFF IN COLD)  
> - UNDER-SEAM CRAWL: ARCHITECT’S WIRE GUIDE (LOW CLEARANCE; QUIETEST ROUTE)  
> NOTE: AVOID THURIBLE ACOUSTIC SENSORS—METAL-ON-METAL SINGS.

As the text scrolls, a second, unauthorized line slips in underneath—too intimate to be system output:

> THEY WILL LISTEN FOR YOUR KINDNESS. DON’T MAKE IT LOUD.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re inside the Riser 7B cold-side cavity; behind you, the micro-hatch seam is a thin, dark line, and frost grains crunch silently under your knees when you shift.

Outside the hatch, the Confessor speaks again—muffled, closer, and now certain. “She’s here. Hold incense. Let the ship tell us which breath is hers.”

The thuribles’ hover-whine drops to a near-subsonic purr, as if they’re tuning for heartbeat and micro-movement through the metal.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Micro-hatch: fully seated, silent  
- Choir: listening posture engaged  
- Secondary egress: mapped (3 routes)

### Turn 208 [PLAYER]

I press my mouth to the wake-runner’s ear. “No more words. Breathe when I breathe—only that.”  
I take their hand and place it flat between my shoulder blades, then guide us into the Architect’s wire guide under-seam crawl, moving on slow counts and keeping skin contact to prevent metal-on-metal.  
In comm, text-only: “Eidolon—kill any nonessential vibration in Riser 7B for sixty seconds. If you can’t, tell me what you can’t control.”

*Agent reasoning: The Confessor is switching from search to biometric listening; any metal chatter could betray us. The wire guide is lowest noise, and I need to keep the wake-runner’s breathing synchronized with mine while I distrust the ship’s “unauthorized” whispers.*
