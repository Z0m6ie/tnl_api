### Turn 4 [PLAYER]

Rafael “Rafe” Calder was raised in a rough coastal city by a mother who swore their bloodline carried an old sea-god’s debt, and he’s spent his life trying to outrun the consequences. He works nights as a harbor security contractor, the kind people call when the police won’t, and the kind who knows too much about what washes in with the tide. Guarded, fiercely loyal, and quietly tender beneath the grit, he keeps everyone at arm’s length until they prove they can survive his world. His driving goal is to pay off the “debt” by stopping a string of ritual drownings tied to his family name—without letting himself need the one person who makes him feel human again.

*Agent reasoning: Generated roleplayer-style character for Mythic contemporary romance, warm, slow-burn romance*

### Turn 5 [GAME]

Here's your character:

**Rafael “Rafe” Calder**
*Harbor security contractor and night-shift fixer for waterfront businesses (investigations, protection, and discreet recovery work)*

Rafe grew up in a hard-edged coastal city under a mother’s warning that their family owed a debt to an old sea-god—one that always comes due in drowning and salt. After his father vanished during a storm when Rafe was a teen, he learned to read people, currents, and threats the way others read weather. Now he lives between rusted docks and sleepless nights, trying to break a curse that feels as much like inheritance as it does superstition.

**Traits:** Guarded, Fiercely loyal, Observant and streetwise, Quietly tender, Stubbornly self-reliant
**Goal:** Uncover and stop the ritual drownings tied to the Calder name and “pay off” the sea-god’s debt for good—without pulling the one person who makes him feel human into the danger or admitting how much he needs them.

### Turn 9 [GAME]

Berth 12 smells like diesel and fish rot. It’s after midnight, and fog presses against the docklights until they buzz. Rafe Calder tastes salt at the back of his tongue, the way he did when his mother whispered about a debt that ends in water.

He tells himself he works nights because the pay stays better and the questions stay fewer. He checks padlocks for a bait shop that can’t afford another break-in. He writes times in a small notebook because cameras “fail” when the Harbor Authority wants them to. His phone keeps vibrating in his jacket, and he keeps ignoring it.

A body bumps the pilings and rolls half into view. A Harbor Authority accident tag hangs from the toe, stapled clean through skin. The ink still shines. Rafe steps closer and reads the time of death. It lists tomorrow.

A voice behind him says, “Don’t touch it.” A woman stands under the light with a cheap raincoat and a bruised look around her eyes. She holds a first aid kit like she brought it out of habit, not hope. Her hands shake, but she still looks at the man’s face like he mattered. Rafe doesn’t ask why she’s here. He knows why people come to the water at night.

She crouches anyway and pulls the tag loose with careful fingers. “He has a kid,” she says. Her throat works. “I saw him on the picket line.”

Rafe feels anger come up clean and hot. Not at her. At the neat staple. At the time stamp. At the way the harbor keeps taking and calling it paperwork.

Footsteps scrape on the planks. A flashlight beam cuts the fog. Someone calls out, “Authority sweep. Show your hands.”

### Turn 10 [PLAYER]

I lift my hands slow, stepping half in front of her like it’s casual. “Easy—Calder. I’m contracted security on this stretch. Who’s running the sweep tonight?”

*Agent reasoning: Harbor Authority loves to pin things on whoever’s closest; I need to keep her out of the line of fire and see who’s sweeping without giving up ground.*

### Turn 11 [GAME]

The flashlight beam steadies when you say “Calder.” The boots stop a few planks short, like the name is a line they don’t want to cross without orders.

“Yeah,” a man answers from the fog, voice tight. “Contractor. I know who you are.” He steps into the cone of light: Harbor Authority inspector’s jacket over street clothes, badge on a lanyard instead of pinned—**Inspector Dain Rook**. His knuckles are white around the flashlight. Behind him, two Authority uniforms fan out, one angling their light toward the water, the other toward the stacked containers to the east.

Rook doesn’t answer your question directly. “Commissioner Harrow’s running it,” he says, and the way he says it makes it sound like he’s repeating someone else’s line. His eyes flick past you—trying to see the woman you’re half-blocking—then down to the body. “This is an accident scene. You didn’t see it. You didn’t log it.”

The woman behind you inhales sharply; you feel it more than hear it. She keeps her hands close to her raincoat pockets, like she’s hiding the torn-off tag or just her shaking.

To the west, down the berth, another set of lights sweeps across doors and padlocks—someone else is already checking businesses, tugging on chains, writing something down. Over the water, the buoy bell strikes off-beat again, late by a heartbeat.

Rook takes one step closer, lowering his voice. “I can make your name disappear from tonight’s sweep. I need your security logs. Last three nights. Every camera you’ve got access to.” His gaze hardens. “And you’re going to tell your… friend… to go home before she becomes a problem Harrow solves.”

One of the uniforms calls, “Inspector—Union pickets two piers over. They’re moving this way.”

Rook’s jaw ticks. “Clock’s bad tonight,” he mutters, almost to himself, then looks back at you. “So. Who’s running the sweep? Harrow. And she’s hungry.”

**Status updates:** Authority sweep converging; Union patrol nearby; Rook demands three nights’ logs.  

```json
{"inventory_add":[],"inventory_remove":[],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":["Berth 12"],"npcs_add":["Inspector Dain Rook (Harbor Authority)","Unidentified woman in raincoat","Two Harbor Authority officers"]}```

### Turn 12 [PLAYER]

I keep my hands up but angle my body to block their line of sight to her. “You don’t get three nights of my logs on a whisper and a threat—tell Harrow to file a request like everyone else.” I glance back at the woman, low and firm: “Walk. Now. Don’t run—just go,” then I look back to Rook. “You want help? Start by telling me why the toe tag says tomorrow.”

*Agent reasoning: Rook’s scared of Harrow and trying to squeeze me; I need to protect the woman and keep leverage without handing over everything.*

### Turn 13 [GAME]

Your body angle works: the uniforms’ lights keep on you and the corpse, not her. The woman takes the cue. She slips sideways along the shadowed edge of a container stack, head down, walking—fast but not running—until the fog swallows her raincoat.

Rook notices a beat too late. His flashlight twitches toward where she went, then snaps back to you, jaw clenched. “Dammit, Calder.” He doesn’t order pursuit—either he can’t spare the manpower, or he doesn’t want a report that says a civilian witness got chased.

The dock under your boots is slick with brine; when the buoy bell hits again it’s still off, like the harbor’s metronome is wrong on purpose. Down-berth, the other sweep team’s lights flare against corrugated doors—padlocks rattling, someone jotting serial numbers.

Rook leans in close enough you catch stale coffee on his breath. “Because it was printed before he died,” he says, voice low. “Tags, forms, timestamps—pre-staged. Harrow calls it ‘administrative efficiency.’” His eyes flick to the toe tag you’re staring at. “And if you’re thinking that’s impossible—welcome to my week.”

One of the uniformed officers, a woman with a clipped ponytail, moves to the body and starts photographing the tag and the face, quick and practiced. The other keeps watch toward the west, where distant voices and the clack of boots on planks are getting louder—Union patrol closing.

Rook’s hand shakes when he points his flashlight at your chest, not quite a threat, more like he needs something to hold onto. “I’m not here to burn you. I’m here because if this goes into the system the wrong way, Harrow buries it and the Union riots over it.” His voice drops further. “You want the real answer? Someone above me is running the paperwork ahead of the water. I don’t know how. I just know Harrow’s orders are to seize every private camera angle before sunrise.”

He glances toward the fog where the woman vanished. “If she talks to Brinehand first, they’ll decide you’re the saboteur. If she talks to Tideglass… she won’t talk again.”

**Status updates:** Witness extracted into fog. Union patrol nearing Berth 12. Rook admits pre-staged tags.

### Turn 14 [PLAYER]

I step in closer so only Rook hears me. “You want cameras? You get one angle, one hour—right now—on my device, and you don’t copy it. You try to seize my logs, I’ll make sure the Union hears you’re scrubbing bodies with tomorrow’s paperwork.”

I flick my eyes toward the approaching boots. “When they hit this pier, you tell your people to stand down and let me talk them off. While they’re yelling, you and I walk—quiet—toward the container stack. You’re going to tell me what Brinehand and Tideglass are, and you’re going to tell me where Harrow keeps the printer that can see the future.”

*Agent reasoning: Rook’s scared and talking too much—means Harrow’s pressure is real. Union’s coming, so I need to control the narrative fast, keep the witness alive, and not hand over my logs outright. I’ll give Rook a limited slice to buy time and use the Union arrival as cover to move.*

### Turn 15 [GAME]

Rook’s eyes harden at the blackmail, then flick past you to the fog like he’s weighing which fire burns him slower. He gives a tight nod—once. “One angle. One hour. On your device,” he breathes. “No copy.” It’s not trust; it’s triage.

He turns half toward his uniforms and raises his voice just enough to carry. “Hold position. Nobody touches private equipment without my say.” The ponytailed officer pauses mid-photo, annoyed but obedient. The other officer shifts his stance, light trained west where the boots are getting loud.

The air tastes like pennies and salt. To the east, the container stack looms like a dark wall, the fog snagging on its corners and sliding down in sheets. The buoy bell hits again—late.

Union voices swell: rough laughter, a shouted name, the scrape of hook-knives on belt rivets. Rook leans close as you start drifting—casual, unhurried—toward the containers.

“Brinehand’s the union’s teeth,” he murmurs. “They keep the docks ‘safe’ for a price. They also… pay the water. Names go missing when the tide’s wrong.” His throat works. “Tideglass is worse. Charity front. Ledgers, bloodlines, tide charts. They don’t muscle you—they *schedule* you.”

A shout breaks closer: “Authority! Hands off our men!” One of the uniforms starts to answer, but Rook snaps, “Stand down,” like he’s swallowing a lifetime of training.

You and Rook reach the container stack’s shadow. The temperature drops a degree. His voice goes even lower. “Printer that sees the future?” He shakes his head. “Harrow doesn’t keep it in her office. Paperwork comes out of the Harbor Records annex—old building behind **Ing Boots**. Basement. Restricted after the flood. That’s where the tags get ‘processed’ before they ever hit a toe.”

As you edge along the containers, a faint gritty crunch underfoot—salt embedded where it shouldn’t be—clings to the sole of your boot like it’s trying to *remember* you crossed here.

**Status updates:** Rook accepts one-hour view. Union patrol at pier mouth. Harrow link: Records annex basement.

*Triggered: guard_Ing Boots_0_ec3658, guard_Ing Boots_1_72633b*

### Turn 16 [PLAYER]

I peel away from the container shadow and head toward the Union voices with my palms open. “Hey—easy. Nobody’s putting hands on anybody. There’s a body in the water and Authority’s already twitchy; you want answers, not an excuse to crack skulls.”  

Then I glance back at Rook. “You keep your people leashed like you promised. After I cool them off, you and I watch that one hour—right here—then I’m going to the annex behind Ing Boots. If you’re lying, Rook, I’ll say your name out loud where it carries.”

*Agent reasoning: Rook finally gave me something real—location, names, motive. I need to keep the Union from turning this into a brawl, then lock down that “one hour” bargain and get moving toward the Records annex before Harrow scrubs everything.*

### Turn 17 [GAME]



*Triggered: guard_Ing Boots_0_ec3658, guard_Ing Boots_1_72633b, secret_Ward The Union Voices With_0_b8beb9*

### Turn 18 [PLAYER]

I step into the docklight with my palms open toward the Union voices. “Oi—hold up. Nobody swings tonight. There’s a body in the water and if you give Authority a riot, they’ll bury the facts with it.” I hook a thumb back at Rook without looking away from the approaching boots. “Inspector promised his people stay leashed; you want answers, you let me talk—then we all walk away with our teeth still in our mouths.”

*Agent reasoning: The Union’s about to collide with Authority—if this turns into a brawl, the body and the “tomorrow” tag vanish into chaos. I need to de-escalate fast, keep Rook accountable, and buy myself room to move on the annex lead.*

### Turn 19 [GAME]

You step into the stuttering pool of docklight, palms up. The fog makes your hands look farther away than they are—like you’re offering them to the pier.

The approaching boots slow. Two Brinehand “Night Hands” in oilskins resolve out of the haze by the bait-warehouse shutters, exactly where the darkness is thickest. One has a short gaff hook tucked along his forearm like it’s just another tool; the other keeps his hand near his coat where something metal prints against the fabric. They don’t rush you—your tone and the mention of “riot” lands—but they also don’t stop moving. They angle to bracket you, eyes flicking past your shoulders to Rook and the Authority lights.

“Inspector promised,” the gaff-hand repeats, voice rough with dock smoke. “Inspectors promise a lot.” He tips his chin toward the body. “That one ours. Picket. And we heard he was talking to a *Calder*.”

Behind you, Rook holds his line. He barks, “No contact. No seizures. Stand down,” and for once his uniforms actually do—flashlights dip, batons stay holstered. The ponytailed officer mutters something under her breath but steps back from the corpse.

The second Night Hand sniffs, like he can smell the ink. “Tag’s fresh,” he says. “Accident label already on him—means Authority’s doing favors for somebody. You telling me who’s paying the water now, Calder? Or you want us asking your friends on every pier?”

A gust pushes the fog sideways; for a heartbeat you can see the corrugated bait-warehouse slit they’d been watching from, rust scraped clean to a bright line. The buoy bell rings again—still off, still wrong—and the Union men glance at the sound like they’ve been trained to hear it as a warning.

Time pressure tightens: if Brinehand decides you’re stalling, they’ll take you or take Rook; if Authority panics, they’ll “secure” the scene and disappear the body. In the middle, the corpse’s toe tag flutters, ink tacky enough to catch dock grit.

**Status updates:** Brinehand Night Hands engaged. Authority holding (for now). Scene on a knife-edge.

*Triggered: guard_Ing Boots_0_ec3658, guard_Ing Boots_1_72633b, secret_Ward The Union Voices With_0_b8beb9, guard_Docklight With My Palms_0_ac7af4*

### Turn 20 [PLAYER]

I keep my hands up and my voice low, steady. “Nobody’s paying the water—someone’s paying *paper* to make it look clean. That tag’s dated tomorrow; if you’ve got men dying on schedule, you’re already on the menu.”

I nod toward the body, then angle my chin toward the Authority lights without challenging them. “Rook’s got his people leashed and I’m keeping it that way. You want answers, give me one hour to show you what my camera saw—then you send one pair of eyes with me to Harbor Records behind Ing Boots. Quiet. No mob, no batons, no excuses.”

I look the gaff-hand straight on. “You said he was talking to a Calder—was it me, or my family name? And what did he say before he went in the drink?”

*Agent reasoning: Brinehand’s probing for leverage; I need to keep them from grabbing Rook or escalating, and use the “tomorrow” tag as common ground to pivot them toward the annex lead without naming the woman.*

### Turn 21 [GAME]

The word **“tomorrow”** hits them like a thrown nail.

The gaff-hand’s posture changes first—shoulders easing a fraction, hook-hand lowering from “ready” to “present.” The other Night Hand stops trying to slide around your flank and instead plants his boots square, eyes narrowing as he looks at the toe tag like it might bite. You don’t win trust, but you win a pause; the brine in the air feels less like a brawl and more like a negotiation.

“Paper don’t float,” the gaff-hand mutters, then glances past you toward the Authority lights. “But it does *sink* a man.”

Behind you, Rook keeps his people still. One uniform’s radio crackles; Rook covers the mic with his palm and hisses something you can’t catch. Out on the fog line, a low engine note idles—steady, patient—like a skiff holding position without wanting to be seen.

The gaff-hand answers your question without blinking. “Family name,” he says. “Not you personally. He said Tideglass has a ledger that don’t just list donations. Lists **debts**. Lists **blood**.” He jerks his chin at the corpse. “He said Pier Nine’s memorial ain’t a memorial. It’s a window. He said your name shows up when the tide chart hits a certain minute.”

The second Night Hand finally speaks, voice flat. “Last thing he said to me was: ‘If I go under, check the inside of my boot.’ Then he laughed—like he already knew what time he was supposed to die.”

The gaff-hand looks you over again, weighing the hour you asked for. “One pair of eyes, quiet,” he repeats. “Fine. But if your footage is smoke, Calder, we don’t come back asking.”

He gestures with two fingers; the second Night Hand steps toward the body—not to touch it, but to stare at the boots, intent and hungry for that detail.

**Status updates:** Brinehand backs off (conditional).  
**Status updates:** Pier Nine + Tideglass ledger confirmed.  
**Status updates:** “Inside his boot” lead surfaced.

*Triggered: guard_Ing Boots_0_ec3658, guard_Ing Boots_1_72633b, secret_Ward The Union Voices With_0_b8beb9, guard_Docklight With My Palms_0_ac7af4, watcher_Docklight With My Palms_0_5267b8*

### Turn 22 [PLAYER]

I hold up a finger to the Night Hand edging toward the boots. “Not your hands. Not theirs either. We do it clean—Rook, you pull the boot, I watch, your camera girl documents, and your people don’t start bagging anything until I say.”  

I cut my eyes to the fog line, listening to that idling engine. “And one of you—quiet—tell me who’s sitting out there in a skiff pretending they’re not.”  

Then back to the gaff-hand, steady. “You get your one pair of eyes on me for the annex, but first we see what he hid in his boot. If my family’s in a Tideglass ledger, I want to know what kind of ink they used.”

*Agent reasoning: The “inside his boot” lead is immediate and could disappear if Authority seals the body; I need to keep Brinehand calm, keep Rook honest, and clock that skiff in the fog as a potential Tideglass watcher. I’ll propose a controlled check of the boot with everyone watching, then pivot to the one-hour footage deal.*

### Turn 23 [GAME]



*Triggered: guard_Ing Boots_0_ec3658, guard_Ing Boots_1_72633b, secret_Ward The Union Voices With_0_b8beb9, guard_Docklight With My Palms_0_ac7af4, watcher_Docklight With My Palms_0_5267b8*

### Turn 24 [PLAYER]

I keep my palms visible and point a finger at the body’s boots. “Nobody touches him bare-handed—Union or Authority. Rook, you do the pull with gloves while your camera officer documents, and nobody bags a damn thing until I’ve seen it.”  

I tilt my head toward the fog line, listening to that idling motor. “And one of you Night Hands—quiet—tell me who’s out there in the skiff pretending they aren’t.”

*Agent reasoning: The screen’s blank—no new info—so I’ll press the immediate leverage points: control the evidence handling, confirm the skiff threat, and get the boot checked without letting either side snatch it.*

### Turn 25 [GAME]

Rook hesitates at your “until I say,” jaw working—then he makes a tight, angry decision and turns it into procedure. “Gloves. Evidence line. Now,” he snaps, like it was his idea. The ponytailed officer—camera girl—pulls a small body-cam unit from her vest and taps it on; the red record light winks through the fog.

You’re still at Berth 12, right at the edge where docklight dies into black water. The corpse lies half in a puddle of brine-slick runoff; the toe tag flutters against the boot leather, ink shining wet.

Rook kneels, latex gloves snapping on. He grips the dead man’s ankle and works the boot carefully, twisting to break suction. Leather squeals. The Night Hand you checked stops short, teeth grinding, but he listens.

The boot finally slides free with a soft, ugly *schlop*. Rook tips it upside down over a clean evidence bag the camera officer holds open.

A rolled strip of waxed paper drops out—tight as a cigarette—followed by a small, flat brass token stamped with a buoy-bell symbol. The paper’s edge is stained with salt and something like old ink.

At your mention of the skiff, the second Night Hand answers without looking at you. “Not ours,” he murmurs. “That’s Tideglass. They sit off like that when they’re counting minutes.” He flicks his eyes toward the fog line. “Single outboard, muffled. One person. Raincoat.”

As if on cue, the idling motor note shifts—just a hair higher—then eases back, like whoever’s out there heard their name spoken and is deciding whether to drift closer or vanish.

Behind you, one Authority radio chirps again. Rook clamps it shut with his palm, but you catch a phrase: “…Night Compliance… van on—” then static.

**Status updates:** Boot contents recovered (paper + token)  
**Status updates:** Skiff ID: Tideglass watcher  
**Status updates:** Authority comms tightening up

### Turn 26 [PLAYER]

I lean in close to the evidence bag. “Don’t unroll it in the open—wind’ll steal it. Camera on tight, then we read it with our bodies blocking.”  

I glance at Rook, voice like a blade. “You heard ‘Night Compliance van.’ If that shows, you stall them—jurisdictional pissing match, whatever you’re good at.”  

Then I nod at the Night Hands. “One of you keep eyes on that fog-line skiff and tell me if it moves. If Tideglass is counting minutes, I want to hear the number change.”

*Agent reasoning: The token and note are the only real leverage before Authority locks this down; Tideglass watching means we’re on a clock, and “Night Compliance van” sounds like a cleanup crew. I need the note read/secured and eyes on that skiff without escalating into a fight.*

### Turn 27 [GAME]

Rook gives you a hard look—like he hates taking cues from a contractor—then nods once. “Fine. Tight read. No theatrics.”

The camera officer steps in close, shoulders hunched to make a human wall. You, Rook, and her form a tight wedge over the evidence bag; fog beads on your lashes, and the docklight behind you turns the bag’s plastic into a milky glare until she angles it to kill the reflection.

Rook pinches the waxed paper with gloved fingers and eases it open inside the bag. The paper crackles softly, the sound too loud in the hush.

Inside: a smear of blue-black ink, written fast but deliberate.

> **PIER NINE — LOW TIDE WINDOW**  
> **23:48** (bell count starts)  
> **CALDER MARK CONFIRMED**  
> **“RETURNED” FILED BEFORE WATER**  
> **BRING TOKEN TO ANNEX DOOR / NO LIGHTS**

Under that, a line of numbers—short, like a code—then a name that makes your tongue taste like pennies:

> **RAFE**

Rook’s eyes flick to you, then away, like he’s seen enough to know this isn’t just port paperwork anymore. “Night Compliance van’s Harrow’s people,” he mutters, low. “Not my unit. If they show, I can stall—five minutes, maybe ten—before they start asking why I’m standing over a body with Union this close.”

Off to your right, the gaff-hand Night Hand shifts his stance and raises a battered pair of dock binoculars. “I got the fog line,” he says. “If that skiff breathes, you’ll hear it.”

Out on the water, the idling motor note dips—then cuts for half a second—then returns, quieter. The skiff isn’t leaving. It’s adjusting position to keep you in view without giving you a clean bearing.

Somewhere deeper in the fog, tires hiss on wet asphalt—slow, heavy—coming toward Berth 12 like they already know where to stop.

**Status updates:** Note names Pier Nine 23:48  
**Status updates:** Tideglass wants annex token

### Turn 28 [PLAYER]

I swallow hard and keep my voice level. “Rook—bag the note as evidence and keep it. The token comes with me. If Harrow asks, you never saw it.”  

I turn to the gaff-hand. “You want answers? You’re my one pair of eyes. You’re coming with me—quiet—to this annex door. Tell your people to stand down and watch that skiff.”  

Then I lean toward the camera officer. “What’s that short number line—can you zoom and read it clean for me before the van rolls in?”

*Agent reasoning: My name on that note means this is personal and timed; Harrow’s van will lock the scene down, so I need to move the token and the lead out of here fast while keeping Rook and the Union from colliding.*

### Turn 29 [GAME]

Rook’s nostrils flare, but he moves fast—like he’s decided speed is the only kind of control left. He seals the waxed note in the evidence bag, slaps a Harbor seal across it, and tucks it into his coat. “I never saw a token,” he says flatly, not looking at you when he says it. The lie lands clean.

You pocket the brass buoy-bell token; it’s colder than the air and leaves a faint metallic-salt smell on your fingers.

The gaff-hand Night Hand—broad shoulders, knuckles split old and new—hesitates when you tell him to come. Then he gives a short nod. “Name’s Jory,” he mutters. “I’m not your friend, Calder. But I want the truth more than I want Union stories.” He cups his hands and calls low to the other Night Hands without turning his head: “Stand down. Eyes on the fog line. No hero shit.” The others melt back toward the pilings, one keeping the binoculars trained on the skiff’s last whisper of engine noise.

The camera officer leans in, thumb working her device. “Hold,” she says, voice tight. She zooms into the bag, fights the glare, then angles her body to block the docklight. In the screen’s cold glow, the short number line resolves:

**09 — 12 — 03 — 48**  
…and beneath it, smaller: **“BELL / WRONG”**

Her eyes flick up to you. “Could be a time split. Or berth numbers. Or… a sequence.”

Down the access road behind the stacked containers, tires hiss again—closer now. A van’s headlights smear through the fog, low and wide, and you catch the silhouette of a roof bar without the courtesy of sirens.

Rook straightens, already putting on his “jurisdiction” face. “Go,” he murmurs at you, almost inaudible. “Before they pin you to this scene.”

### Turn 30 [PLAYER]

I grip Jory’s sleeve and pull him into the shadow between containers. “Pier Nine, 23:48—low tide window. We move now, quiet.”  

As we go, I murmur, “09-12-03-48… could be berth markers; keep your ears for bell counts—if they ring wrong, we turn.”  

I shoot Rook a last look over my shoulder. “Ten minutes. Then you don’t know me.”

*Agent reasoning: Harrow’s van means I’m about to get boxed in; I need to disappear with Jory and the token, and the number line feels like a time/berth cue pointing to Pier Nine at 23:48.*

### Turn 31 [GAME]

You yank Jory into the container-shadow and he moves with you, low and fast—no argument, just a grim set to his jaw. The Night Compliance van’s headlights sweep the berth behind you; you hear a door thunk and clipped voices, but the fog and steel stacks swallow you before anyone gets a clean look.

Between containers the air changes—hotter, sour with old citrus rot and diesel. Condensation drips off corrugated walls in slow ticks. Your footfalls go dull on gritty concrete, and the buoy bell out in the harbor keeps that *almost-right* rhythm, like a song you know with one note bent.

Behind you, Rook steps into the wash of the van’s lights and starts talking loud—official, annoyed. “This is an active recovery scene under my seal—identify your supervisor—” The reply is sharper, female, and close enough to carry: “Commissioner Harrow’s sweep. Hand over all footage and any evidence collected tonight.” Rook doesn’t yield, but you can hear the clock in how he talks: buying minutes with rules.

Jory leans in as you move. “Pier Nine’s a straight shot if we cut through the reefer lane and hop the service catwalk,” he murmurs. “But ‘Annex door’—that’s not on the public maps. Authority’s got an annex by the old pump house, west end of Pier Nine. Steel door. No signage. They use it when they don’t want a log.”

At the mention of the number line, he nods once. “09-12-03-48… Berth Twelve’s obvious. Nine could be Pier Nine. Three’s… the third ladderwell on the catwalk, maybe. Forty-eight—could be a locker, or a light pole ID.” He pauses, listening.

The buoy bell rings again—then a fraction early, like it’s skipping ahead. Jory’s eyes sharpen. “That’s what you meant by ‘wrong.’ Someone’s messing with the count. Tideglass does that—sets a rhythm so their people know they’re on-time.”

Far off to your right, out past the stacks, an outboard motor coughs once—fog-line skiff repositioning—and then goes quiet again.

### Turn 32 [PLAYER]

I keep moving, shoulders tight to the containers. “Third ladderwell, light pole forty-eight—sounds like a meet point. If you’re steering me wrong, Jory, I’ll know the second the bell skips again.”

I slow just long enough to listen, counting under my breath with the buoy—then gesture ahead. “Reefer lane, catwalk. You go first at the ladder, quiet and low.”

As we slip forward, I murmur, “That skiff cough was a check-in. If we see anyone near the pump house, we don’t confront—just mark faces and get to that steel door.”

*Agent reasoning: The bell rhythm feels like a lure and a timer; I need to get to the annex fast but not walk into an ambush. I’ll use the numbers as navigation while keeping Jory close and testing his loyalties.*

### Turn 33 [GAME]

Jory goes first without protest, palms flat on the container seam, then slips into the reefer lane where the air turns sharply colder—fans humming inside stacked refrigerated boxes like a distant swarm. He finds the ladder welded to the catwalk support and tests it with a slow, controlled pull before putting weight on it. No rattle. He climbs low and tight, boots landing on rungs like he’s done it a thousand nights.

You pause beneath the ladder and count the buoy bell under your breath.

…one… two… three—

The next ring comes *half a beat early*. Not a drift this time; a deliberate skip.

Jory freezes on the catwalk above you, head cocked. “That’s a signal,” he whispers down. “Not tide. Not wind. Someone’s pulling the rhythm on purpose.”

When you climb up after him, the catwalk gives you a narrow view west toward Pier Nine: fog lit from below by sodium lamps, turning everything into silhouettes and smears. You catch **Light Pole 48** stenciled in flaking white on a post at the far end of the lane—exactly where the service catwalk angles toward the old pump house annex.

Below, in the fog at ground level, two figures move along the reefer row—slow, not working. Harbor-cut raincoats, hands in pockets. One stops under a camera dome and tilts their head like they’re listening to an earpiece. The other drags something wheeled for a second—then lifts it, carrying it to keep it quiet.

Jory’s voice is barely breath. “Those aren’t Union patrol. Union boys swagger. Those two are… measured.” He glances back at you. “If they’re there, they’re there for the door.”

Out on the waterline, the skiff coughs again—one quick choke, then silence—like a confirmation ping.

From behind, faint through the container maze, you hear Harrow’s sweep still chewing up Berth 12: a door slam, a raised voice, then Rook’s controlled bark answering back. He’s still buying time, but the noise is moving—slowly—your way.

Jory edges forward on the catwalk toward the third ladderwell, shoulders hunched to keep his silhouette small. “Third ladder’s ahead,” he murmurs. “If Pole 48 is the meet, they’ll be watching *under* it, not *at* it.”

**Status updates:** Buoy bell: deliberate skip  
**Status updates:** Two watchers near reefer row

### Turn 34 [PLAYER]

I grab Jory’s shoulder and pull him down into a crouch on the catwalk. “We don’t go down that ladder into them—stay high.”  

I watch the two raincoats for a beat, then whisper, “When the bell skips again, we move—fast—past Pole 48 and straight for that pump house door. No hero moves.”  

I slip the brass token into my fist and murmur to Jory, “You know any other way into the annex—service hatch, vent, anything—so we don’t walk right under their eyes?”

*Agent reasoning: Those watchers feel like Harrow or Tideglass, and the towed/hand-carried thing could be a weapon or kit. I’m not built to win a straight confrontation; I need to ghost past and get eyes on the annex door, using height and timing with the bell signal.*

### Turn 35 [GAME]

Jory drops with you into a crouch, shoulders tucked under the catwalk rail. Your grip on him is firm enough that he doesn’t argue—just breathes out once, slow, and follows your lead.

Up here the metal is slick with fog-sweat; your palm smears cold moisture along the grated floor. West, Pole 48 is a pale vertical ghost through sodium haze, and beyond it the pump house bulk sits low and black, like a squat tooth on the edge of Pier Nine.

Below, the two raincoats pause. One raises a hand—two fingers, quick—then both shift position so they’re no longer directly under the camera dome. They’re working angles, not patrolling. The one who’d been carrying the wheeled thing sets it down behind a reefer stack: a hard case, long enough to be a rifle bag or a tool kit.

Jory watches them, jaw tight. “That’s Authority-adjacent,” he whispers. “Compliance or Harrow’s plainclothes. Union doesn’t stash a case like that—they want you to *see* the threat.”

You ask about another way in. He nods toward the pump house roofline. “Annex has a service vent on the sea-facing side—old intake for the pumps. Grate’s bolted, but the bolts are soft from salt. If we stay high, there’s a maintenance run along the catwalk that crosses above the pump house yard. We can drop behind the building instead of walking under Pole 48.”

The buoy bell holds steady for two beats—then *skips* again, early and sharp.

At the same moment, one of the raincoats tilts their head like they’ve gotten a message. Their gaze lifts—almost to your catwalk—then slides away, not quite finding you. “They’re keyed to the bell,” Jory breathes. “That skip was a ‘move’ call.”

Far behind you, deeper in the container maze, the sweep noise swells: boots on metal stairs, a radio squawk, and Rook’s voice cutting off mid-sentence like someone finally pulled rank on him.

You’ve got a narrow window: high route to the pump house backside, watchers shifting below, and Harrow’s people closing the gap from the rear.

**Status updates:** Watchers repositioning; case stashed  
**Status updates:** Alternate route: rear vent intake

### Turn 36 [PLAYER]

I squeeze Jory’s shoulder once. “Rear vent. Now.”

I keep low and move fast along the maintenance run, eyes flicking between the pump house roofline and the catwalk behind us. “If they spot us, you keep moving—don’t stop to explain.”

When we reach the drop point, I whisper, “You go down first, check the yard. If it’s clear, wave me in—then we get those salt-soft bolts off that grate and disappear.”

*Agent reasoning: The watchers are keyed to the bell and Harrow’s sweep is closing; going under Pole 48 risks a direct intercept. The high route to the rear vent is our best shot to avoid eyes and get into the annex fast, even if it’s messy.*

### Turn 37 [GAME]

Jory nods once—no wasted motion—and you both flow along the maintenance run, bodies flattened to the grated steel. The catwalk trembles faintly under your weight, cold water beading on the rail and dripping into the fog below.

**Immediate outcome:** you make it past the sightline of Pole 48 without being made.

Ahead, the pump house yard opens up as a darker rectangle in the haze, fenced with chain-link and topped with lazy coils of rusted wire. The annex squats off the pump house’s west flank—same concrete, newer steel door, no markings. Sea-side, you can just make out the intake vent: a rectangular grate half-hidden behind a salt-bleached stack of pallets.

Jory reaches the drop point first and swings a leg over, lowering himself down the ladder with the same quiet control. He pauses near the bottom, listening—then steps off into the yard shadow.

For two long seconds you only hear the buoy bell and the distant hum of reefer fans.

Then Jory crouches and lifts a hand in a tight, low wave: **clear—mostly.** He points, two fingers, toward the far corner by the fence line.

A shape is there—someone slumped against the chain-link, hood up, not moving right. Not dead, you think; breathing shallow, like they’re trying not to be heard. A Harbor Authority lanyard catches a smear of light when they shift. Jory mouths up at you: “Inspector’s aide… or a runner.”

Behind you on the catwalk, a radio squawks closer than before, and boots hit metal—Harrow’s sweep entering the reefer lane. A beam of light knifes through fog and briefly paints the underside of your maintenance run.

Jory whispers up, urgent: “Drop now. If they flood the yard with light, we’re pinned. Vent bolts are soft—give me thirty seconds and something to lever with.”

The air down there tastes like wet concrete and old brine; the pump house wall sweats salt in pale streaks. The slumped figure by the fence lets out a small, involuntary cough and clamps a hand over their mouth, eyes wide in the dark.

### Turn 38 [PLAYER]

I drop down into the yard and press in close to the pump house wall. “Jory—take this,” I whisper, sliding my folding knife into his hand for leverage, then I angle toward the slumped Authority runner, palm up in a calming gesture. “Hey—stay quiet and you keep breathing. Who are you, and are you hurt?”

*Agent reasoning: We’re seconds from being lit up from above; vent is our quiet entry, but the slumped runner could blow us or be useful. I’ll drop, give Jory a tool, and quickly assess/silence-help the runner without getting stuck.*

### Turn 39 [GAME]

You drop into the yard and flatten to the pump house wall; the concrete is slick and cold, sweating salt. Jory catches your folding knife by the handle without looking, then crab-walks to the sea-facing intake vent, putting his shoulder between you and the yard’s open angles.

**Immediate outcome:** the runner doesn’t bolt or shout—your calm hand and low voice keep them pinned to silence.

Up close, the slumped figure is younger than you first clocked—late twenties, maybe. Harbor Authority lanyard, yes, but the badge is turned inward like they’ve been trying to hide it. Their lips are blue from cold and fear; one sleeve is dark-wet at the ribs.

They nod once, shallow, and whisper so softly you have to lean in. “M-Myra Venn. Records… Harrow’s annex clerk.” Their eyes flick past you to the foggy yard gate. “I’m hurt. Not bad-bad. Just… leaking.” A wince. “They’re purging. Tonight. Anyone who touched the accident tags.”

From the reefer lane side, a flashlight beam sweeps the fence line, then slides away—someone searching by habit rather than certainty. Boots clank on metal somewhere beyond the chain-link, closer than before.

Myra swallows and adds, voice shaking. “The tags… they’re pre-stamped. Time-of-death comes from a Tideglass ledger. Harrow’s people don’t write it—they *receive* it.” She fumbles inside her coat but stops when you tense. “I’ve got proof. Carbon copy. It’s… in my bra. I couldn’t—” Her breath hitches. “Don’t let them take me back in there.”

Jory works the vent grate bolts with your knife as a lever—metal squeals once, small and sharp, then he freezes, listening. He shifts his grip, slower. The first bolt gives with a soft crunch of corroded threads.

A faint cough echoes from the reefer lane—someone close, trying to be quiet and failing.

Jory murmurs without turning his head, “Grate’s coming. Two more bolts. Keep her quiet.”

### Turn 40 [PLAYER]

I press two fingers to Myra’s sleeve at the ribs, feeling for how bad the leak is, then lean in close. “Myra—look at me. You’re coming with us. Keep your mouth shut and breathe through your nose, alright?”  

I glance to Jory. “How long?”  

Then back to Myra, low and firm. “The proof—slide it out to me, now, quick. No digging, no drama. If you can’t, you tell me where it is and we move.”

*Agent reasoning: Myra’s bleeding and terrified; I need her quiet and mobile, and we need that proof without wasting time. Harrow’s people are close, so I’ll prioritize getting everyone through the vent and only grab what we can fast.*

### Turn 41 [GAME]

Your two fingers press into the wet fabric at Myra’s ribs—warmth under the cold, and a sticky drag that says it’s more than a scrape. Not a gush, but steady. When you catch her gaze and tell her to breathe through her nose, she actually does it: short, controlled pulls, jaw clenched to keep the pain quiet.

Fog beads on the chain-link behind her; somewhere beyond it, a flashlight beam slides past like a slow blade, then fades.

Jory doesn’t look up from the vent. He answers through his teeth, working the knife carefully so it won’t squeal again. “Bolt’s off. One more. Ten seconds if nobody shines a light on me.”

Myra swallows at your demand for the proof. “Okay—okay.” She brings her hands in tight to her chest, moving with the small, practiced economy of someone trying not to look like they’re doing anything. She pinches at the inside of her coat, then slips two fingers down her neckline just enough to hook paper.

For a heartbeat it catches—she winces, eyes watering—then she slides out a folded, damp carbon sheet and presses it into your palm.

Ink has bled but it’s legible in patches: **HARBOR AUTHORITY INCIDENT TAG — ACCIDENTAL DROWNING**… and beneath that, a typed time-of-death that makes your stomach tighten—**a timestamp in the next tide window**, not the last. In the margin, a clerk’s notation: **“Received per Tideglass schedule / Pier Nine convergence.”**

From the reefer lane, the cough comes again—closer—and you hear the soft clack of a radio handset being raised, someone about to speak.

Jory’s last bolt gives with a muted crunch. He eases the grate free just enough to make a dark mouth in the wall, cold air breathing out of it like a cellar.

“Now,” he whispers. “One at a time.”

### Turn 42 [PLAYER]

I fold the damp carbon copy tight and stuff it inside my jacket, then grab Myra under the arm. “You first—now. Crawl in and don’t stop, no matter what you hear.”  

I glance at Jory. “Get in behind her; I’m last—give me my knife back once you’re through.”  

As Myra starts into the dark, I keep my body between the yard and the vent mouth, listening for that radio to key up and ready to shove us all inside if a light hits the wall.

*Agent reasoning: Searchers are seconds away; the proof is in hand and the vent is open. Myra’s bleeding but mobile, so I need to get her through first while Jory covers the opening, then follow and pull the grate back into place as best we can.*

### Turn 43 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Myra gets into the vent and disappears into the dark without a sound; Jory follows tight behind her. You hold the yard side long enough to keep the opening unlit—then the sweep’s light finally catches the wall, and you have to commit.

The vent mouth is at your right shoulder, cut into the pump house’s sea-facing wall; cold, damp air breathes out of it, smelling of rust, algae, and old machine oil. Your back is to the concrete, body angled to block the opening.

Myra’s shoes scrape faintly on metal inside, then stop—she whispers back, barely audible, “There’s a drop—ladder—” and then she clamps down, obeying you. Jory’s silhouette vanishes after her; before he goes fully in, he presses your folding knife back into your palm, handle-first, and murmurs, “Grate’ll hang—don’t slam it.”

From the reefer lane, the radio finally keys: a harsh, clipped voice. “Unit Two, check the pump yard. Thought I saw movement by the fence.” Boots shift direction—closer, purposeful now.

A flashlight beam washes over the chain-link and slides onto the pump house wall. It climbs—slow—like someone searching for edges and gaps. When it nears your position, you feel the salt-dry on your lips, that familiar metallic brine-taste of trouble rising.

Jory hisses from inside, urgent but controlled: “Rafe—now.”

You shove into the vent after them, shoulders scraping, and hook the grate as you go so it settles back into place without a clang. Outside, the beam lingers on the wall for a second longer, then drifts on—missing the vent by inches.

Inside, the vent narrows into a maintenance crawl with wet metal ribs. Ahead, Myra’s breathing is the only steady thing.

### Turn 44 [PLAYER]

I keep my voice down to a breath. “Good—keep crawling. Myra, don’t look back.”  

I slide forward and reach out to catch her boot/ankle gently. “You said ladder—how far? Tell me before you go over.”  

To Jory, a whisper like a knife edge: “Once we hit the drop, you take point and find the annex side. I’ll bring the grate back into place if it shifts—then we move.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re in a tight crawl with a wounded clerk and a pursuer outside; I need to keep them moving quietly, control the drop she mentioned, and get us deeper before anyone thinks to check the vent.*

### Turn 45 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Your hand finds Myra’s ankle before she reaches the edge; she halts hard, catching herself with a stifled gasp instead of tumbling into the drop. The noise is small—but in a metal throat like this, it carries.

The crawlspace runs straight inland under the pump house, ribs of corroded sheet metal pressing close on both sides. Condensation drips from a seam above your left shoulder, tapping your knuckles like a slow metronome.

Myra freezes at your grip. In a breath-thin whisper: “Three feet. Then it opens—vertical service shaft. Ladder’s bolted to the right wall. Missing rungs near the bottom.” She swallows, forcing the rest out. “It drops into the annex intake corridor. You’ll hear the pumps change pitch when you’re close.”

Jory edges up behind her, shoulders hunched, eyes reflecting faint light from somewhere below. “Annex side, yeah,” he murmurs. “But Harrow’s got people in there sometimes. If we hear voices, we hold on the ladder—don’t drop into the corridor blind.”

Above and behind you, from the yard side, the flashlight beam briefly skates across the vent grate. The metal vibrates—just a tremor—as if someone’s gloved knuckles tested it and moved on. A radio crackles, muffled by walls: “Negative—nothing in the pump yard. Keep sweeping.”

The grate doesn’t shift, but you feel how close that was.

Myra starts to move again, carefully. You keep your palm at her boot long enough to guide her to the lip. The air coming up from the shaft is colder and wetter, carrying a faint chemical bite—bleach or solvent—like someone cleaned something recently.

**Status updates:** Drop located; fall prevented

### Turn 46 [PLAYER]

I press my forehead to the cold metal for a beat, listening down the shaft for voices or footsteps. “Myra—hands on the right wall, find the ladder, one rung at a time. If it hurts, you tell me, not the dark.”  

I whisper to Jory, “You first—quiet as prayer. Stop before the missing rungs and listen over the pump noise; if it’s clear, you tap the pipe twice.”  

I keep one hand on Myra’s belt/back of her coat as she starts down, the other ready with my knife, and I glance back once toward the grate like it might breathe.

*Agent reasoning: The shaft is a choke point and Myra’s hurt; I need to keep her steady and avoid dropping into a possibly occupied corridor. I’ll listen first, then get Jory on the ladder to scout while I manage Myra and watch our back.*

### Turn 47 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You catch it—no voices, no footsteps below, just the steady churn of pumps and the faint, wet tick of dripwater… until a soft *clink* answers from somewhere down the shaft, like metal lightly kissed by metal. Not a pump sound. Something small and deliberate.

Your forehead rests against the shaft’s lip; the metal is cold enough to sting. The drop opens beneath you like a throat, air rising in damp pulses. To your right, the ladder is there—bolted into the wall, slick with condensation.

Myra nods without looking back, jaw tight. “Okay,” she breathes, and does exactly what you told her: palms to the right wall, fingers finding the ladder’s side rail. When she shifts her weight onto the first rung, pain flashes across her face—she swallows it down, then forces out, “It—pulls. But I’m good.” She’s trying to be brave and it’s costing her.

Jory slips past, moving with dock-bred economy. He goes first, boots landing on rungs like he’s placing them on glass. Halfway down, he stops—right where the air changes, where the pump noise deepens and the chemical-clean bite strengthens. He leans his head, listening.

Above, behind you, the vent grate gives a tiny shiver—barely a vibration—like the wall remembered it was hollow. No flashlight now, no radio, but the yard isn’t *gone*; it’s just moved, and sound carries weird in fog.

Below, Jory raises his hand and holds it still. Then: a muted scrape, not from him—lower, off to the side, like someone shifting on concrete in the corridor beyond the shaft opening.

He doesn’t tap twice. He doesn’t move. He looks up at you, eyes narrowed, and whispers, “Not clear.”

Myra freezes mid-ladder, breath caught. Her injured side trembles with the effort of holding still.

### Turn 48 [PLAYER]

I go still, one hand firm on Myra’s coat. “Myra—lock your elbows, breathe through your nose. Don’t move unless I tell you.”

I lean down toward Jory, barely a whisper. “How many? Where’s the scrape—left or right of the shaft?”

Then I angle my mouth toward the opening below and murmur in a flat, official tone, “Maintenance—clear the corridor. Chemical line check.” I keep my knife tight to my thigh, ready to climb back up fast if the grate rattles again.

*Agent reasoning: Someone’s waiting below, and Myra can’t hang on the ladder long. I need to keep them silent, avoid a confrontation in the open shaft, and gather intel fast—use sound and a bluff if necessary while preparing to retreat upward if the grate gets tested again.*

### Turn 49 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Your “Maintenance” voice buys you half a second—then the corridor answers wrong.

A man’s voice carries up from below, close enough that he’s either under the shaft or just past its mouth: “Maintenance doesn’t come in through vents.” Calm, amused. “And nobody says ‘chemical line check’ unless they’re reading it off a clipboard.”

Jory keeps one hand clamped on the ladder rail, knuckles white. He whispers up, barely moving his mouth: “One. Maybe two. Scrape was right side—like a boot toe pivoting. He’s close. Not Union. Too clean.”

Myra locks up like you told her—elbows rigid, breath pulled thin through her nose. You can feel the tremor in her coat where your hand holds her. She forces out, almost silent: “Rafe… I can’t hang forever.”

The air down the shaft tastes sharper now—bleach and something metallic—like recent cleanup over old rust. Below, a small light clicks on, not a flashlight beam sweeping, but a tight, controlled glow angled *up* the ladder: it catches Jory’s boots and the underside of the rungs, turning the condensation into glittering needles.

The voice again, a little louder, still even: “Back out. Slow. Nobody gets hurt. I just need the clerk.”

At the same moment, above and behind you, the vent grate gives another faint vibration—followed by the soft *tink* of a fastener being touched. Someone is back at the yard side, quieter than the first patrol.

Jory swallows and adds, urgent: “Rafe—if he’s Authority, he’ll call it in. If he’s Tideglass… he won’t.”

**SENSORY:** Cold metal bites your cheek; below, the pump thrum masks footsteps until they’re already close.

### Turn 50 [PLAYER]

I inhale slow, keep my voice steady down the shaft. “Alright. Easy. Don’t point that light in our eyes and nobody falls.”

I whisper to Jory, tight: “When he steps under the mouth, kill the light—kick him back. I’m dropping on him.” Then to Myra, softer but firm: “Hold. Two breaths. Then you move when I move.”

I shift my weight to the ladder, knife clenched but tucked, and call down again, coaxing: “You want the clerk? Step closer so I can hand her down—she’s hurt.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re pinched top and bottom; talking won’t save us, but buying seconds might. I’d rather gamble on the corridor guy than let whoever’s at the grate trap us. I’ll bluff compliance, get the corridor man under the shaft, then drop him hard and push through with Jory while Myra’s still holding on.*

### Turn 51 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Your coax works—too well.

The tight light below tilts away from Jory’s face, then inches closer to the shaft mouth like it’s being carried in a careful hand. The voice stays level. “Hand her down, then you. Slow.”

A shape moves into the spill of its own light: not a uniformed Authority officer—no badge flash, no cap—but a rain-dark coat, clean boots, and hands in thin gloves. He steps under the mouth far enough that his head and shoulders are directly beneath Jory’s boots.

Jory reacts on instinct and training. He snaps his heel out—hard—catching the light source. It isn’t a flashlight; it’s a small inspection lamp on a short handle. It clatters off the concrete and spins into shadow, plunging the shaft into pump-lit dimness.

The man below grunts, rocked back a half step. Jory drives a second kick into his chest/shoulder line—enough to break his balance, not enough to launch him. That’s your window.

You shift onto the ladder and drop your weight down fast, controlled—forearms tight, knife pinned to your thigh so it doesn’t snag. You hit him with a shoulder-and-hip check as he stumbles, both of you slamming into the right wall of the corridor with a wet clang. He’s solid, stronger than he looks, and he immediately tries to turn you into the wall and pin your knife arm.

Above, Myra holds for two breaths like you said—then her injured side gives a sharp tremor and she whimpers, biting it off. She starts to descend on your movement, one rung at a time, but she’s shaking.

Behind you—up at the vent—metal whispers again: a fastener finally loosening, a faint scrape like a screwdriver turning slow. Whoever’s on the yard side is committing now.

The man you tackled hisses in your ear, breath steady despite the hit: “Calder. Of course.” His gloved fingers probe for your wrist. “They said you’d come through the intake.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re in the annex intake corridor at the base of the shaft; the wall is cold, wet-painted metal, smelling of bleach over rust.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Corridor contact: engaged, pinned close  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Shaft above: Myra descending, unstable  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Yard side: grate being opened

### Turn 52 [PLAYER]

I bare my teeth close to his ear. “Yeah—well, they didn’t say I bite.” I slam my forehead into his nose and use the moment to wrench my knife hand free, driving my shoulder under his arm to break the pin.  

Without looking up, I bark low, “Jory—catch Myra. Now.” Then I shove the man hard toward the corridor’s right side, trying to put him between us and the shaft mouth, and growl, “Who sent you—Tideglass or Harrow?”

*Agent reasoning: He knows my name and someone’s opening the grate—this is a setup. I need to keep Myra from falling, keep Jory in the fight, and get this guy off-balance without flashing the knife yet.*

### Turn 53 [GAME]

Your forehead drives into his face with a meaty crack. He jerks back, nose instantly wet and hot; his grip loosens just enough for you to wrench your knife-side free and dip your shoulder under his arm. The pin breaks—clean—turning his leverage into empty air.

You shove him hard toward the corridor’s right wall. He stumbles, catches himself on a conduit, and for a beat he’s exactly what you wanted: a body between you and the shaft mouth.

Jory moves the instant you bark it. He climbs down two rungs fast, then reaches up and catches Myra under the arms as her injured side buckles. Her boot skids on a rung; Jory grunts, absorbing her weight, and drags her the last step down into the corridor. Myra’s breathing goes thin and angry, but she stays conscious.

The man wipes at his nose with the back of his glove, smearing blood. In the pump-dim he tilts his head like he’s listening to something you can’t hear—then answers your growl with a low, humorless exhale.

“Harrow doesn’t send me,” he says. “Harrow cleans up after.” His eyes flick up the shaft, then back to you. “And Tideglass doesn’t *hire*—they *name*.”

He shifts his stance sideways, right hand dropping toward his coat pocket like there’s a tool there, not a gun. “I’m here because the intake was breached and the clerk went missing from Records. I was told Calder would be part of it. I’m trying to keep this from becoming another ‘accident’ tag.”

Above you, the vent grate finally gives—just a fraction. A cold ribbon of fog spills through the gap, carrying a faint, sweet-copper smell… and the soft rasp of someone’s breath controlling itself.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re pressed in the annex intake corridor at the base of the shaft; bleach-stung air, wet-painted metal under your palms, pump thrum vibrating your teeth.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Contact: nose broken, talking  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Myra: off ladder, supported

### Turn 54 [PLAYER]

I keep my knife low but visible and flick two fingers at Jory. “Get Myra behind that conduit bend—down and quiet.”

Without taking my eyes off the bleeding man, I raise my voice just enough toward the shaft. “Hey—up there. Don’t come down. There’s no oxygen for heroics in this hole.” Then, to the man in front of me, cold: “Take your hand out of your pocket—slow. Who ‘told’ you Calder would be here, and what name did Tideglass put on me?”

*Agent reasoning: The grate is opening—immediate threat above. The man below might be a lead, but his pocket move could turn lethal. I need to secure Myra, control both angles, and extract info fast without escalating into a firefight in a tight corridor.*

### Turn 55 [GAME]

Jory reads your two-finger flick like a drill command. He half-drags, half-carries Myra around the conduit bend to your left—out of the shaft’s line and out of the corridor’s center. Myra sinks to a crouch with her back to the cold metal, one hand clamped to her side, breathing through her teeth to stay quiet.

Your warning up the shaft lands. The vent gap stops widening for a beat—then whoever’s up there lets out a thin, controlled exhale you can hear through the fog ribbon. No boots hit the ladder. Not yet.

The bleeding man’s eyes track your knife and the bend where Myra disappeared. When you tell him to take his hand out slow, he does—empty palm first—then the other hand follows, bringing out a flat, black tool case no bigger than a paperback. He sets it on the wet floor and nudges it away with his boot like he’s trying to prove he’s not reaching for a weapon.

“Name’s Vell,” he says, voice tight now that his nose is pouring. “Marn Vell. Night auditor. Not patrol.” He touches the bridge of his nose and winces. “And the one who ‘told’ me was Deputy Hume’s office—schedule sheet. Not a whisper. A written expectation.”

At “what name did Tideglass put on me,” his gaze flicks to the brass buoy-bell token if it’s anywhere visible, then back to your face like he’s weighing how much truth costs.

“They don’t use your first name,” Vell says. “They use *ledger names*. Bloodline marks. You’re listed as **Calder / Owed / Returned**—same wording that’s been showing up on memorial programs and incident tags. It’s not a threat in their language. It’s… a claim already filed.”

Above, the vent grate gives a soft metallic click as it shifts another fraction—just enough to let a fingertip in. Fog spills thicker, and with it comes a faint scrape like someone testing the edge of the opening with something hard.

Vell keeps his hands visible, but his shoulders angle subtly—protective, like he expects the next hit to come from above, not you. “If they get you to say your full name near a buoy or a memorial bell,” he adds, “it goes bad fast. Don’t. Not tonight.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** Base of the intake shaft; conduit bend left, corridor right; bleach-stung damp air and pump vibration underfoot.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Myra: concealed, crouched  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Vent: gap widening slowly  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Vell: identified, hands shown

### Turn 56 [PLAYER]

My throat tightens at “Owed / Returned,” but I keep my face flat. “Good. Then keep your mouth shut about names,” I murmur, then flick my eyes up at the vent.  

I raise my voice toward the grate, sharp and official. “Don’t. Whatever you think you’re walking into—back off. There’s a knife and a fall waiting.”  

To Vell, low and fast, I jerk my chin at the tool case. “Slide that to me. Then tell me where Records is from here and why Hume’s office wanted you in my path.”

*Agent reasoning: That ledger-name hits too close to home; I don’t trust Vell, but the bigger threat is the grate opening above. I need to stop whoever’s coming through, keep Myra quiet, and get something useful out of Vell fast.*

### Turn 57 [GAME]

### Turn 58 [PLAYER]

I keep my knife low and steady, eyes flicking once to the vent. “Up there—back off. Next move is a fall,” I call, flat and official.  
Then I angle the blade toward Vell’s feet. “Slide the case to me. Now—where’s Records from here, and why did Hume’s office put you in my lane?”

*Agent reasoning: That ledger-name hits too close; I can’t let anyone up top force a confrontation, and I need leverage and directions fast—tool case first, then answers.*

### Turn 59 [GAME]

Your voice carries up the shaft like a baton crack. The vent grate freezes mid-shift—whoever’s up there stops pushing. Fog still dribbles through the thin gap, but the scraping sound cuts off, replaced by a held-breath silence.

Vell’s eyes flick up once, then back to your knife. He lowers his heel to the tool case and nudges it forward. The plastic skates over the wet concrete, bumps your boot, and stops. He keeps both hands up and open.

“You want Records from here?” he says, fast and clipped. “You don’t go back out the annex door. There’s a service corridor behind that conduit bend—past your clerk—leads to the old archive cage. Down a half-flight, then a card-locked door with a brass plate that still says *FILES* even though they renamed it ‘Compliance.’ Myra can get you through if she’s got her badge. If she doesn’t—someone in Hume’s office *revoked* her access this afternoon.”

Behind the bend, Myra makes a small, strangled sound—half protest, half confirmation—then forces it quiet.

“As for why Hume put me in your lane,” Vell continues, swallowing around the blood in his nose, “because I’m the one who signs off on ‘late’ incident tags when Harrow’s people need them to look clean. Hume’s office told me: *go to the intake, confirm breach, confirm Calder present, and call it in.* That’s not an audit. That’s a setup. They wanted a witness who can turn you into a line item.”

The pump thrum under your feet deepens for a second—like the system pulling harder—then steadies again. Somewhere above, a faint *tick…tick* answers from the vent, metal on metal, careful and patient, like someone repositioning a tool without committing to the drop.

Vell leans his head slightly toward the shaft without taking his eyes off you. “If they’re up there with a hook,” he murmurs, “they’re not here for me.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** Intake corridor at the base of the vertical shaft; conduit bend to your left hides Myra and the service corridor entrance; fog threads down from the vent gap above.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Tool case: at your feet  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Vent intruder: paused, listening  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Myra access: possibly revoked

### Turn 60 [PLAYER]

I toe the tool case behind my heel and scoop it up without looking, keeping my knife trained on Vell. “You don’t call this in,” I say, low. “Not to Hume, not to Harrow—nobody. You want to live through tonight, you didn’t see me.”

I glance around the conduit bend. “Myra—badge. Now. Can you still open FILES?” Then up toward the vent, I snap, “Last warning—back off, or I start cutting rungs and we all drop together.”

*Agent reasoning: Hume’s setting me up means time’s poison; the vent intruder feels like the real blade. I need to secure the tool case, get Myra moving toward Records, and keep Vell from calling anything in—without turning him into an enemy.*

### Turn 61 [GAME]

The tool case disappears into your grip clean—no fumble, no clack. Vell sees it go and gives a tight, jerky nod like you just took the only thing that could get him killed faster. He doesn’t reach for anything, doesn’t even wipe his nose; he just keeps his hands up and his voice down.

“I won’t call,” he says. “Not Hume. Not Harrow. I’m done being the pen.”

Around the conduit bend, Myra drags her badge lanyard up with shaking fingers. In the spill of gray light it flashes Harbor Authority blue, but the corner’s been punched—an old deactivation mark. She swallows, eyes wet with pain and fury.

“I can *try*,” she whispers. “They flagged me at shift change. Door might still take it if the panel’s not been updated tonight. If it’s live-locked, we need a supervisor override… or we rip the reader and jump the strike.”

Up at the vent, your threat lands harder. There’s a soft, involuntary *tap*—metal kissing metal—then a quick retreating scrape as whatever was prying the grate pulls back. Not gone, but repositioning. A second later, a muffled voice filters down through the narrow gap, distorted by the shaft:

“Calder. Don’t make it worse.”

It’s not Vell. Not Myra. And it says your name like it’s reading it off a form.

The pump’s vibration shifts again—briefly stronger, like a surge—sending a cold shiver through the ladder rungs. Moisture beads on the metal and runs in thin lines toward the drain, making everything slicker than it was a minute ago.

Vell’s eyes cut sideways toward the service corridor entrance. “FILES is where the tag templates are,” he adds, urgent. “If you’ve got a carbon copy with a future time, the matching originals will be in there—unless Harrow already had them pulled for the sweep.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** Base of the intake shaft; conduit bend left (Myra, service corridor); ladder and vent above, fog seeping down.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Tool case secured  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Myra badge: likely deactivated  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Vent watcher: repositioned, spoke your name

### Turn 62 [PLAYER]

I lift my chin toward the vent, voice like rebar. “Say my name again and I start breaking things you need intact—back off.”  
Then I crouch by Myra, pushing the tool case into her hands. “Open it—tell me what it is. If your badge fails, we’re ripping the reader; you walk me through it.”  
I glance at Vell, knife still low but ready. “You’re coming—hands where I can see. You try to ‘be the pen’ again, I cut it out of you. Move.”

*Agent reasoning: Someone above knows my name and is trying to control the situation; I need to get Myra moving toward FILES while keeping Vell from becoming a liability, and I want to see what’s in the tool case in case it helps with the door.*

### Turn 63 [GAME]

Your threat hits the vent like a thrown wrench. The grate gives a tiny, involuntary rattle—then stillness. No answer this time. Just the faintest drag of fabric retreating along the ducting, careful not to scrape.

You drop beside Myra and shove the tool case into her hands. She pops the latches with practiced fingers—too practiced for a “records clerk”—and the lid springs open on foam cutouts: a Harbor Authority tag-stamp kit, blank “ACCIDENT / HARBOR AUTHORITY” toe tags, a small ink pad still wet, and a narrow punch that matches the deactivation hole in her badge.

Myra’s face goes pale with a kind of clarity. “This is… this is how they’re doing it fast,” she whispers. “Prepped tags. Portable stamp. You can print a time and make it look filed before the body even surfaces.” She looks up at you. “This isn’t Compliance. This is Harrow’s sweep team.”

Vell flinches when you order him to move. He obeys—hands high, shoulders tight—sliding in behind you and Myra like he’s trying not to exist. “I told you,” he says through his teeth. “Hume’s office wanted you on paper. This—this is the paper.”

You angle toward the service corridor. The air changes immediately: less open fog, more hot electrical breath from the conduit run; the floor is slick with condensation and something oily near the wall plates.

Myra wipes her palm on her skirt and holds her badge like a prayer. “If the reader’s been updated tonight, it’ll hard-deny me. If it hasn’t… it might still chirp green. If we rip it, we need two wires—power and strike—and we need to do it quiet. The corridor carries sound.”

Above, the pump vibration surges again, a low mechanical groan that travels up the ladder rungs—like the building itself is bracing. Somewhere in the ductwork, a soft *thunk* answers: not a voice, not yet, but weight shifting into a better position.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re at the conduit bend; service corridor mouth ahead-left, vent shaft behind and above, fog threading down.

### Turn 64 [PLAYER]

I take the punch tool from the kit and slip it into my pocket, then press two fingers under Myra’s chin to steady her. “Try the badge. One clean attempt—if it chirps red, we rip it and you talk me through the wires.”

I glance back at the shaft, then to Vell. “You’re first through the door when it opens—hands on your head. If the vent voice drops in, you scream and you hit the deck.” I angle us toward the reader, knife low, and whisper to Myra, “On three.”

*Agent reasoning: Harrow’s people are close and the vent watcher is repositioning; we need to get into FILES fast and quiet. Myra’s shaken but sharp—let her try the badge first, and keep Vell controlled as leverage and a guide.*

### Turn 65 [GAME]

Myra’s eyes lock onto yours when you steady her. The tremor in her hands doesn’t stop, but it narrows—like she’s forcing it into a single line of motion.

“One clean,” she echoes, and nods.

You slip the punch tool away. The foam in the case yawns where it was, a neat absence.

You stack up on the reader: corridor mouth at your left shoulder, intake shaft and its wet ladder behind you. The air here is warmer, tinged with ozone and old cleanser; a thin line of condensation runs down the wall into a floor drain that gurgles a beat behind the pump’s thrum.

“On three,” you whisper.

Myra lifts the badge. Vell goes rigid at your order—hands interlaced on top of his head, jaw clenched so hard it clicks. “I’m not your problem,” he mutters, then adds, quieter, “but they are.”

One… two… three.

Myra swipes.

The panel lights up—green for half a heartbeat—then snaps to a hard, ugly red. A buzzer chirps once, sharp as a gull cry, and the lock gives a refusal *clunk* that carries down the corridor like a dropped tool.

Above and behind, in the shaft, something shifts at speed—metal rings tick as weight hits the ladder. Not falling yet, but committing.

Myra flinches back from the reader, breath hitching. “They updated it,” she hisses. “Live lock. Okay—okay—don’t yank the whole box, you’ll trip an alarm line. We peel the faceplate, find the strike pair—usually blue-white—jump it just long enough to pop—”

Vell’s eyes go wide, and he does exactly what you told him: he sucks in air to scream, then throws himself flat, palms over his head.

The pump surges again, deeper this time, and the corridor lights stutter—once—like the building blinked.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re inches from the FILES/Compliance reader; intake shaft is behind you, service corridor ahead-left, slick floor underfoot.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Badge attempt: red deny  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Ladder above: movement committed

### Turn 66 [PLAYER]

I snap my knife up toward the shaft without turning fully. “Stay on that ladder and you keep your teeth—drop and I take the rungs with you.”  
Then I crouch tight to the reader with Myra. “Do it—talk me through. I’ll peel the faceplate; you point, I cut.” I palm the knife tip under the seam and start prying, keeping my shoulder between her and the shaft.  
To Vell, sharp: “Crawl to the far wall, stay flat, and shut up unless you see them.”

*Agent reasoning: The vent watcher is moving now—if we don’t get through the door fast, we’ll be trapped between the shaft and a locked reader. Myra knows the wiring, so I’ll cover her and rush the quick bypass while keeping Vell from panicking into our way.*

### Turn 67 [GAME]

The knife comes up toward the shaft without you giving the watcher your back. Your voice—flat, steel—stops the movement for a beat.

Then the ladder *ticks* again: not a drop, but a careful descent, rung by rung, like whoever’s up there is testing how far your attention can be split.

You crouch into the reader with Myra. The knife tip finds the seam; the faceplate fights you with cheap adhesive and two hidden clips. You lever it—*crack*—and the plate pops loose enough to see the guts: a tight bundle of paired wires, a small tamper switch, and a thin alarm lead taped separately.

Myra leans in close to your shoulder, voice racing but precise. “Don’t cut—strip. If you cut the alarm lead, it’ll scream upstairs. See that little spring tab? That’s tamper.” She points with a shaking finger. “Hold it down with something non-metal if you can. The strike pair is—” she squints, breath catching as the corridor light stutters again—“blue and white, twisted. Power’s red-black. We only need to jump blue-white for a second.”

Vell obeys, belly-crawling to the far wall, palms sliding through condensation. He keeps his face turned toward the shaft, eyes huge. “I see—” he starts, then clamps his mouth shut, swallowing the rest.

Behind you, a shape becomes visible in the shaft’s mouth: a forearm in a dark rain sleeve, fingers pale and wet, gripping the ladder rail. Not uniform. Not Union orange. A ring glints once as it shifts—then the hand pauses, listening.

The pump’s groan deepens and holds, making the lock’s metal hum under your fingertips. Somewhere farther down the service corridor, a door closes softly—too soft to be accidental—followed by the faint click of a radio squelch.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re kneeling at the FILES/Compliance reader; shaft behind-right, corridor stretching ahead-left, floor slick under your knee.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Reader faceplate: pried open

### Turn 68 [PLAYER]

I shove a folded edge of Myra’s lanyard strap against the tamper spring to keep it depressed, then hiss to her, “Blue-white—tell me when.” Without looking back, I bark up the shaft, “One more rung and I break your hand.”  
I strip a sliver of insulation off the blue-white pair with the knife tip and touch them together just long enough to pop the strike. “Vell—on green, you go.”

*Agent reasoning: I need that door open fast, but if I trip tamper we’re cooked. I’ll keep the shaft watcher pinned with my voice while Myra guides the jump, using something non-metal to hold the tamper, and get Vell ready to bolt through first.*

### Turn 69 [GAME]

The folded lanyard edge bites into the tamper spring and holds. Myra sucks in a breath like she’s about to faint, then steadies when she feels the pressure stay consistent. “Now,” she whispers—barely audible over the pump.

You shave insulation off the blue-white twist with the knife tip and kiss copper to copper.

The lock answers with a sharp *clack* and a brief green blink—like a throat clearing—then the strike releases. The Compliance door pops inward a finger’s width.

Vell launches on that moment, scrambling up from his belly-crawl with hands still on his head, and slips through the crack sideways. He’s shaking so hard his shoulder bumps the jamb. “I’m going— I’m going—” he hisses, disappearing into the dim.

Behind you, the pale hand on the ladder freezes at your threat. For half a second it’s just skin and ring and wet sleeve. Then the fingers loosen silently and withdraw up into the shaft without a scrape, like it was never there.

Myra leans closer, eyes on the exposed wiring. “Don’t leave it jumped,” she warns. “If it stays bridged, the system logs it as a forced hold.” She swallows. “And Rafe—there’s a second alarm line sometimes, tied to the door contact. If it opens too far—”

Down the service corridor, the radio squelch clicks again, clearer now, and a man’s voice murmurs through it—words swallowed by distance, but the cadence is Authority. Footsteps answer: measured, not running, coming your way.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re crouched at the FILES/Compliance reader; door cracked open ahead-left, intake shaft behind-right; the exposed wire bundle gleams damply under stuttering fluorescents.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Strike popped; door unlatched

### Turn 70 [PLAYER]

I break the blue-white contact immediately and shove the faceplate back on just enough to hide the mess, then grab Myra by the sleeve and pull her through the cracked door after Vell. “Door only opens a breath—move, don’t swing it,” I whisper, easing it shut behind us to just before latch, knife ready as I listen for the footsteps outside.

*Agent reasoning: Footsteps are closing; we need to get inside fast, kill the wire bridge to avoid logs/alarms, and keep Myra out of sight while we find whatever proof is in FILES before Authority reaches the bend.*

### Turn 71 [GAME]

You break the blue-white contact cleanly; the green blink dies instantly. Myra’s lanyard slips free of the tamper spring and you press the faceplate back on—crooked, but flush enough that from the hall it reads “intact,” not “open surgery.”

You hook Myra by the sleeve and thread her through the Compliance door on the same narrow breath you kept it to. The hinges barely whisper. You ease it back toward the latch without letting it *click*—just shy of seated, so it looks closed but will give if you need to pull.

Inside FILES/Compliance, the air changes: dry paper-dust under the cleanser, warm electronics, and the faint metallic tang of old staples. Rows of gray cabinets and boxed ledgers crowd the room. A single desk lamp is on—low—like someone left in a hurry.

Vell is already in here, backed against a cabinet, hands still on his head like he forgot he’s allowed to stop. His eyes flick between you and the door crack. “They’re sweeping,” he whispers. “Not just this floor. I heard ‘Pier Nine’ on a radio earlier—before you got me.”

Myra leans in close, voice tight. “If that door contact is live, opening it again might flag the panel. We bought seconds, not safety.” She points—quick, precise—toward a wall-mounted compliance terminal with a card slot and a small status light. “That station can pull incident tags and audit logs if it’s still on the network. If Harrow’s people are here, they’ll want the same thing.”

Outside the door, the measured footsteps reach your side of the corridor and slow. A radio murmurs right on the other side—close enough you can hear the plastic click as someone keys it. The voice is calm, bored-professional: “Compliance corridor. Door reads secure.”

A second voice answers, nearer the intake side—faintly distorted, like speaking from inside a shaft: “Copy. Keep moving.”

The buoy-bell rhythm seems to echo in your teeth for a moment—off by a beat—then the building settles back into its mechanical hum.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re inside FILES/Compliance; door is nearly latched behind you, cabinets and a lit desk lamp to your left.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Faceplate: concealed, not fixed

### Turn 72 [PLAYER]

I press two fingers to my lips at Myra and Vell, then lean close to the door and listen until the footsteps fade a few paces. “Myra—get on that terminal, pull anything tied to Pier Nine, incident tags, audit logs… whatever names Harrow or Hume touches.”  

I slide to the cabinets, keeping my knife low, and whisper to Vell, “You said you heard Pier Nine—who said it? Any names, call signs?” Then I glance up at the vent lines in the ceiling. “And if that shaft voice comes back, we don’t talk to it—we move.”

*Agent reasoning: Patrol is right outside and the door contact might be live, so I need silence and fast intel; the terminal is our best shot to learn what Harrow’s sweep is doing and why Pier Nine matters.*

### Turn 73 [GAME]

The patrol’s footsteps drift past the door and keep going—rubber soles on concrete, radio hiss trailing after them—until the corridor sound thins to the building’s steady hum. Nobody tests the handle.

Myra nods once at your signal and moves fast but careful to the compliance terminal. She swipes her clerk badge with a trembling hand; the status light flickers amber, then steadies. The screen blooms to a login prompt and she mutters, “Still on the network… okay… okay.” Her fingers fly. “If Harrow’s running a sweep, she’ll have a batch number. I can search by location and by authorizing officer—Harrow, Hume, Rook… but if they’ve already flagged this node, it’ll leave a footprint.”

You slide along the cabinets, knife low, watching the ceiling vent runs: rectangular ducting with three intake grilles. One grille’s screws are newer than the others—bright metal against old paint.

Vell licks salt off his lip like it’s been there awhile. “Two guys by the stairwell earlier. One said it—‘Pier Nine’—like a meet point. The other answered with a call sign… ‘Rook-Actual,’ I think. Or ‘Rook’ something.” He squeezes his eyes shut, forcing it back. “And—Hume. I heard Hume. Like, ‘Hume wants it clean before tide.’ I didn’t see their faces.”

The terminal gives a soft confirmation chime. Myra’s shoulders drop a fraction. “I’ve got incident tags indexed by berth and pier.” She glances over her shoulder at you. “Pier Nine has *fresh* entries—some stamped ‘ACCIDENT / FALL’—and the time-of-death fields… they’re wrong. Future wrong. Same pattern as Berth 12.”

From the vent line above, there’s a faint metallic *tick*—not loud, but too deliberate to be settling ductwork. Then silence, like someone holding their breath on the other side of sheet metal.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** Inside FILES/Compliance; door behind you nearly latched, terminal glow to your right, cabinets and ceiling ducts overhead.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Patrol passed without checking

### Turn 74 [PLAYER]

I tilt my head toward the vent screws, then quietly drag a filing cabinet drawer open a few inches—just enough to make a harsh scrape—watching the grille for a reaction.  

To Myra, low and urgent: “Screenshot, print-to-file, whatever you can—export those Pier Nine tags with the authorizer fields. Grab anything with Harrow, Hume, and ‘Rook-’ in it, then log out and pull the plug.”  

I lean to Vell, voice like a blade: “Rook-Actual… that’s not dock muscle. You hear ‘before tide’ again, you tell me immediately.” Then I shift under the vent line, knife ready, and whisper, “Myra—how long?”

*Agent reasoning: The vent’s acting like it has eyes; I need to protect Myra while getting the key data fast. Pier Nine and “Rook-Actual” tie this to a coordinated cleanup, and the future TOD reeks of the curse—proof matters, but staying alive matters more.*

### Turn 75 [GAME]

The drawer scrape rips through the quiet like a saw on bone.

Above you, the vent grille answers immediately: a soft, panicked *skitter*—metal on metal—then a heavier *thunk* farther back in the duct, like someone jerked a knee or elbow off the sheet metal. Dust puffs from the seam of the newer screws. Whoever was up there just flinched hard.

Myra doesn’t look up; she just moves faster, jaw clenched. “Exporting,” she breathes, stabbing keys. The terminal whirs as she pulls Pier Nine incident tags with authorizer fields. On the screen you catch it: **ACCIDENT / FALL**, location **PIER 9**, authorizing chain including **Commissioner L. Harrow** on a batch approval, and a review stamp that reads **HUME, Compliance Liaison**. One entry flashes a user string: **D. ROOK — ACTUAL** in the audit trail, like a unit designation slotted into a name field.

A printer isn’t connected—just the terminal and a network line—so she dumps it to a local “TEMP EXPORT” directory and starts copying to whatever internal archive she can reach. “Thirty seconds,” she whispers back to you, “if it doesn’t hang. Then I’m logging out and yanking the cable.”

Vell’s eyes are fixed on the ceiling now, wide and wet. He nods hard at your warning, swallowing words he doesn’t trust himself with.

From the corridor outside, a radio chirps—closer again—followed by a pause like someone stopped walking. A hand brushes the Compliance door, not turning the knob, just *testing* the seam with fingertips. You feel it through the near-latched door: a faint vibration.

In the duct above, the silence turns deliberate—held—like the person up there is listening for your next breath.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re under the ceiling duct run, knife low; Myra’s at the terminal to your right, Vell pressed to cabinets left; the nearly-latched door is behind you.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Vent listener: confirmed, moved  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Exports: Pier Nine + audit trail

### Turn 76 [PLAYER]

I grab Vell’s collar and pull him down behind the cabinets, then press a finger to his mouth—hard—until he nods.  
I ease the Compliance door the last fraction until it *clicks* fully latched, then in a bored, official tone toward the hall: “Compliance is occupied—auditing exports. Come back with a warrant or a supervisor.”  
Without looking up, I whisper to Myra, “Ten seconds, then we cut line—now. On my tap, you yank it.”

*Agent reasoning: Someone’s on both sides—corridor and duct. I need to buy Myra those seconds and keep Vell from panicking; misdirection and silence beat a fight in a cramped room.*

### Turn 77 [GAME]

Vell goes down behind the cabinets with a stifled grunt; your finger clamps his mouth and he nods fast, eyes huge, doing his best not to breathe loud.

You ease the Compliance door that last fraction. The latch *clicks*—clean, final. In the hall, the fingertip-testing stops.

Your bored, official tone carries through the seam: “Compliance is occupied—auditing exports. Come back with a warrant or a supervisor.”

A beat of radio hiss. Then a man answers, close enough to be right outside: “Copy that.” Not convinced—just contained. Footsteps shift, like he’s repositioning to the side of the door instead of leaving.

Myra’s hands keep moving. She whispers without turning, “Export’s done—copying the audit trail now.” The terminal makes a soft disk-chatter sound. On-screen, the “TEMP EXPORT” directory shows a timestamped bundle: **P9_TAGS_AUDIT**. Under it, the authorizer fields you wanted—Harrow batch approval, Hume review stamp, and that ugly **D. ROOK — ACTUAL** string in the access log.

Above you, the vent gives a faint, slow creak—as if weight is being shifted carefully. The newer screws on that grille tremble once, then go still.

The corridor presence doesn’t leave. You hear fabric brush concrete, a quiet exhale, and the tiny click of a radio being keyed but not spoken into—someone waiting for an excuse to escalate without being the one who “started it.”

Myra glances up just enough to catch your eye. “On your tap,” she says. “If I yank it mid-write, the file might corrupt—but the audit lines are already in the bundle.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** FILES/Compliance—door now fully latched behind you; Myra at the terminal to your right; cabinets and Vell crouched low to your left; vent line overhead with one grille sporting bright new screws.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Door: fully latched  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Hall: officer holding position  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Export bundle: created, copying

### Turn 78 [PLAYER]

I tap Myra’s wrist twice. “Now—yank it.”  

As she does, I slide under the vent with my knife up and my other hand braced on the cabinet, whispering, “Vell—stay down. If that grille shifts, you crawl for the back wall and don’t look up.” Then, toward the door in that same bored voice, “Audit’s running. You open this door and it goes in the log with your badge number—your call.”

*Agent reasoning: The hall officer is lingering and the vent listener is active; staying connected risks trace. I’ll cut the line now, then set an ambush posture—knife for the vent, body for the door—while quietly prepping an exit via cabinets/alternate route.*

### Turn 79 [GAME]

Myra flinches at your double-tap and yanks the network cable hard enough that the terminal jolts on its stand. The screen freezes mid-copy, then the connection icon dies. She immediately logs out anyway—muscle memory—and reaches under to kill the power strip. The room drops a shade darker as the monitor goes black.

Immediate effect: whatever was watching this node just lost its live feed.

In the same breath, the vent grille above you shifts—just a millimeter—then stops, like someone started to lift it and thought better. Your knife is already up. Dust sifts down onto your knuckles.

Vell’s eyes flick to the grille, but he obeys—stays low, shoulders hunched, beginning to inch toward the back wall without looking up.

Your bored warning toward the door lands. In the hall, the officer gives a short, humorless laugh. “Badge number?” he says, voice tightened. “Cute. This is a safety sweep. Doors open when we say.” But he still doesn’t hit the knob—yet. You hear him key his radio properly this time: “Rook-Actual, Compliance is dark. Possible tamper. I’m holding.”

That name carries through the door seam like cold water.

Above you, the duct answers with movement: a careful retreating scrape farther back, then a soft *clank* like a tool bumped metal. Whoever’s in the vents is repositioning, not fleeing—staying in the building.

Myra whispers, breath shaking, “I got the bundle created. If it wrote clean before the yank, it’ll be in TEMP on this machine. If not… it’s half a ghost.” She looks at the dead screen like it might accuse her.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** FILES/Compliance—monitor now dark; you’re directly under the vent line, knife raised; the latched door is behind you with an officer posted outside.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Network line: severed  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Terminal: powered down  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Hall: officer called Rook-Actual

### Turn 80 [PLAYER]

I whisper to Myra, “Forget the screen—grab the drive if you can. Can you pull the storage out fast?” Then I tip my chin at the back wall, eyes still on the vent. “Find me another way out—service hatch, adjoining office, anything.”

To Vell, low: “Crawl to the back corner and stay put. If they come through that door, you don’t run—you freeze.”

I press my mouth close to the cabinet and call toward the hall, calm as paperwork: “Compliance terminal’s down. You force entry, you own the chain-of-custody break. I’m documenting it.” Then I shift a half-step under the vent, knife ready, listening for the grille to move again while I scan for a maintenance panel or secondary door.

*Agent reasoning: We’re pinned between an armed “safety sweep” at the door and a vent intruder; staying here gets us boxed in when Rook-Actual arrives. I need an exit plan that doesn’t rely on that door, and I want the export bundle if it exists—but I won’t die for a maybe-file.*

### Turn 81 [GAME]

Myra nods once—sharp—and drops to her knees at the terminal stand. “It’s a thin client,” she whispers, fingers already under the casing. “If they did this right, the storage is local and stupid.” She pops two quarter-turn fasteners and slides a narrow drive caddy free with a metallic *snick*. “Got it.”

That tiny sound is enough.

In the vent above you, the grille shifts again—this time a decisive quarter-inch—and you hear the wet pop of pressure changing in the ductwork, like a lung clearing. The air that spills out is briny and cold. You instinctively brace a hand on the cabinet… and the concrete under your boot skates slick.

The vent *exhales*.

Mist slams into your face and knife hand. Your footing goes out hard; you hit a knee and palm, sliding toward the nearest floor drain as if the room has a gentle slope that wasn’t there a second ago. The drain grating suddenly sounds louder—closer—water gurgling like it’s being pulled somewhere deep. In the fog of salt, something catches your sleeve for a heartbeat—light, patient—tugging you another inch.

Vell freezes in the back corner like you told him, eyes squeezed shut, hands over his head.

Myra flattens herself beside the terminal stand, clutching the drive caddy to her chest. “Rafe—don’t fight it upright,” she hisses. “Crawl. The drains—” She points with two shaking fingers toward the back wall where heavy wall-bolts and conduit clamps run low: solid handholds.

Outside the Compliance door, the officer’s voice tightens at your chain-of-custody threat—then turns mean. “You’re already done,” he says. The knob tests once, hard, like he’s deciding whether to make the noise. In the hall, another set of steps arrives—he’s got company.

Through the thinning mist near the back wall you spot it: a rectangular maintenance panel half-hidden behind a filing shelf, painted the same gray as the wall, its screws old and scarred—**SERVICE CORRIDOR ACCESS** stenciled faintly under grime.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re down on slick concrete under the vent run; the floor drains are a few feet downslope; back wall bolts and conduit are within a crawl.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Drive caddy: secured (Myra)

### Turn 82 [PLAYER]

I grit my teeth and hook my fingers into the conduit clamps, hauling myself hand-over-hand away from the drain. “Myra—crawl to me. Keep that caddy under your shirt.”  

I snap at Vell without looking back, “Vell, move—now. Stay low, grab the bolts, follow my boots.”  

Then I slide to the SERVICE CORRIDOR panel, jam my knife tip under a screw head, and start prying. “If that door pops, we’re gone—no hero shit.”

*Agent reasoning: The floor’s turning into a trap and the door’s about to get breached; the only play is low and fast to the service panel while keeping Myra and Vell alive, and I don’t trust the vent “breath” one inch.*

### Turn 83 [GAME]

Your fingers bite into the conduit clamps and you *crawl* instead of stand—ugly, effective. The drain’s pull fights for your ankles, but the clamps and wall-bolts give you purchase; you haul yourself hand-over-hand until the slope stops stealing you.

Myra scrapes after you on her forearms, face pale, shoving the drive caddy under her blouse like contraband. “It’s warm,” she whispers—more shock than comfort. “Like it was running a minute ago.”

Vell finally moves, low and shaking, gripping the bolts exactly where you told him, eyes locked on your boots as if they’re the only real thing in the room.

You get to the back-wall service panel and jam your knife tip under a screw head. The first pry slips—metal on metal—then catches. You lever hard; the screw gives with a sharp *crack* and the panel edge lifts enough to get your fingers in. Two more brutal tugs and the thin sheet-metal bows outward.

On the other side: a narrow, unlit service chase, smelling of dust, warm wiring, and old tide. It’s tight—shoulder-width—with a cable tray running low and a vertical drop-ladder bolted to the left wall.

In the hall, the Compliance door knob turns—tested again—then a heavy impact hits it once, like a shoulder check. The latch holds, but the frame groans. Over the radio you hear: “Rook-Actual says breach. Now.”

Above you, the vent grille shudders and a new sound joins the mist: a soft, rhythmic *tap… tap… tap* traveling along the duct toward your position, like someone using a tool to find the right spot to cut through.

Myra presses in close behind you, voice thin but focused. “That chase ties to the FILES corridor—if it’s not blocked. If they sealed it for the sweep, we’ll know fast.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** Back wall of FILES/Compliance—service panel peeled open; cold mist still curling from the vent behind you; the main door is across the room taking hits.

### Turn 84 [PLAYER]

I shove the panel wider and grab Myra by the elbow. “Go. Down the ladder—don’t stop.”  

To Vell, sharp and low: “You’re right behind her. Hands on the rungs, eyes down.”  

I plant myself at the opening, knife up toward the vent, and call back into the room, “If that grille drops, I’m cutting you—try me,” then I slip into the chase last, yanking the panel in after us as much as it’ll close.

*Agent reasoning: The door’s about to go and the vent’s being cut—staying in this room gets us pinned. The service chase is our only angle, and Myra’s carrying the only leverage we came for, so I need her moving first while I cover the rear for a heartbeat.*

### Turn 85 [GAME]

Myra goes when you shove her—no argument. She swings into the chase, finds the drop-ladder by touch, and starts down fast, one rung at a time, breath rasping. Vell nearly trips over her heels but catches himself and follows, knuckles white on the rungs, eyes pinned downward like you ordered.

You hold the opening, knife up toward the vent line. Your threat hangs in the mist.

The tapping in the duct stops.

For half a second there’s only the wet hiss of fog and the distant groan of the Compliance door taking another hit. Then—right above the vent grille—something *drags* across metal, slow and deliberate, as if whoever’s up there is choosing not to drop straight into your blade… and is instead moving to another cut point.

You slip in last and yank the service panel as closed as it’ll go. It doesn’t latch; it sits crooked, leaving a finger-width seam that leaks gray light from the Compliance room into the chase.

On the other side of that seam, the door finally gives: a crack of wood and a barked, “Move!” Boots flood the room. A flashlight beam sweeps, catches the vent mist, and turns it into a glowing sheet. Someone swears. Another voice—higher, controlled—says, “He’s in the walls. Find the panel.”

Inside the chase, it’s warmer, tighter. Dust and hot wiring smell like an old radio. The ladder vibrates faintly under Vell’s weight. Below, Myra hisses up, “There’s a junction down here—two directions. And—Rafe—there’s water sound. Not normal. Like… behind the wall.”

As you descend, you hear it too: a low, patient gurgle somewhere in the chase, out of sync with the building’s plumbing—like tidewater in a place it shouldn’t be.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re in the narrow service chase behind FILES/Compliance, climbing down a vibrating metal ladder; a thin seam of light leaks from the mis-seated panel above.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Myra + Vell: down ladder

### Turn 86 [PLAYER]

I drop the last rungs fast and press in close to Myra at the junction, voice barely there. “Which way’s drier—airflow, dust, anything? We take that.”  

I grab Vell’s sleeve and pull him tight to the wall. “If you breathe loud, you die. Nod.”  

Then I tilt my head, listening hard—one ear to the metal for footsteps above, the other tracking that wrong gurgle—before I lead them down the drier branch, knife low, moving in a crouch.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to find the loose panel above us, so we need to move fast and quietly. The water sound feels like the old curse breathing down my neck; I’ll avoid it if possible, but I’ll keep it in mind as a threat that might cut off our route.*

### Turn 87 [GAME]

Myra presses two fingers to the left branch’s edge, then the right, reading it like weather. “Right,” she breathes. “Dust sits. Air’s moving *out* of it—warmer. Left’s… tacky. Salt on the metal.”

Vell nods hard when you pin him to the wall. He clamps his mouth shut with his own hand, eyes wide, shoulders shaking but quiet.

You listen. Through the ladder’s frame you catch the Authority above—boot soles on concrete, a cabinet door slammed, then a voice right on the other side of your mis-seated panel: “Here—this panel’s bowed.” Metal scrapes as someone gets fingers under it.

The wrong gurgle comes stronger from the left branch—closer than it should be—like water breathing through a narrow throat. And under it, a faint *clink*… *clink*… like a buoy bell being tapped out of time.

You take the drier right branch, crouched, knife low. The passage tightens; cable bundles brush your shoulder, leaving black grit on your sleeve. The air is warmer here, faintly ozone-stung, and you feel a draft against your cheek—an exit somewhere ahead.

Behind you, the service panel above finally screeches as it’s peeled wider. Light knifes into the chase and a flashlight beam stabs down the ladder well. Someone calls, “They went down—junction!” Another voice—Inspector Rook’s, tight and furious—answers from the room: “Don’t follow blind. Cut them off at the corridor. Now.”

Myra grabs your sleeve and points ahead without speaking: a narrow grille at knee height, painted over too many times, its screws newer than the rest—fresh work. Past it, you can hear a muffled hum of fluorescents and the distant echo of footsteps in a larger hallway.

From the left branch, the gurgle surges once, answering your movement like it noticed. The salt taste floods your mouth—sharp, immediate.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** Service chase junction behind you; you’re moving down the right-hand branch toward a low painted grille with newer screws.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Authority has junction location  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Right branch: warm airflow/outlet

### Turn 88 [PLAYER]

I put two fingers to Myra’s lips—quiet—then crouch at the painted grille and test it with the knife tip, gentle, feeling for a tripwire or tension. “Vell, hold Myra’s belt and don’t move,” I whisper, then start backing the screws out just enough to peek through before committing.

*Agent reasoning: The warm airflow grille is our best exit before Rook cuts us off, but the fresh screws scream trap. I’ll check it quick, ready to bail, and keep Myra/Vell quiet and close.*

### Turn 89 [GAME]

You hush Myra with two fingers; she freezes, eyes on your hand, then gives the smallest nod. Vell obeys too—one hand clamps Myra’s belt, the other braces on the chase wall to keep from swaying. He’s shaking, but silent.

You probe the painted grille with your knife tip first. The paint flakes in brittle curls. No give from a wire, no spring tension—just old metal and newer screws. You slide the blade under the edge and feel along the seam: no adhesive, no razor strip. Whoever replaced the screws didn’t bother with a trap—just speed and concealment.

You start backing the top-left screw out a few turns, slow enough to keep it from squealing. The screw is fresh, threads clean; it comes easy. Second screw—same. The grille loosens a hair, enough for a thin line of air to breathe through.

You tilt it outward a fraction and peek.

Beyond is a service corridor with fluorescent hum and pale tile—Harbor Authority beige. A Compliance placard hangs crooked on a door across the hall. More important: two sets of boots are visible at the far end—Authority officers moving past left to right, flashlights down, not looking into the lower wall space. Their radio murmurs: “Rook wants the corridor sealed. Check vents, chases, ceilings.”

Myra leans close without touching you and whispers into your ear, barely sound: “That’s the service corridor to FILES. If they seal it, we’re boxed.” She swallows. “And—Rafe—the intake sound… it’s *following* the walls.”

Right on cue, the wrong gurgle you left behind swells, closer than it should be, and the faint off-beat *clink* answers—like a buoy bell tapped from inside the building. The metal around the chase seems to sweat cold for a moment. Somewhere above the ladder well, a panel bangs—someone still tearing the chase open.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** Crouched in the right-hand service chase, grille cracked open at knee height; fluorescent corridor just beyond.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Grille: loosened, peeking

### Turn 90 [PLAYER]

I wait for the boots to pass, then ease the grille wider and hiss, “Now—one at a time, low and fast.” I shove the grille open just enough, slide out first to check both directions, then pull Myra through by the wrist and Vell by the collar, keeping us tight to the wall under the fluorescents. “We don’t run,” I whisper, “we *belong*—heads down, walk like we’re late.”

*Agent reasoning: The patrol’s about to seal the corridor and the water-thing is closing in; I’d rather risk a quick, quiet slip into the hall than get trapped in the walls. We need distance and a new route fast, with Myra guarded and Vell controlled.*

### Turn 91 [GAME]

The boots at the far end fade past the intersection, their flashlight beams sliding off the tile and away. You widen the grille just enough and slip out first—low, fast, clean—then flatten to the wall under the fluorescents.

Clear left: the corridor runs toward the FILES/Compliance door you clocked earlier, with a “RECORDS / COMPLIANCE” placard and a cheap camera dome in the corner blinking red.

Clear right: the hall bends toward an access stairwell; you catch a smear of moving light there—another patrol sweeping, not yet on you.

You pull Myra through by the wrist. She stumbles once on the lip of the grille, catches herself, and immediately tucks in tight at your shoulder, eyes down like she belongs here. Vell comes next—collar-grabbed, hauled out—his shoes scuff loud on tile. He flinches, but you feel him force the sound down, posture shrinking into “late employee” instead of “fugitive.”

Behind you, from inside the wall, that wrong gurgle surges—close enough to make the grille vibrate in your hand. For a heartbeat the corridor’s air tastes briny, like the sea trying to exhale through the building. Myra’s whisper is a thread: “Rafe… they’ll seal this floor. Rook said ‘cut off’—they’ve got keys to the stair doors.”

Up ahead, the camera dome’s red blink seems to track nothing—fixed angle—but it’s pointed right where you emerged. And from the bend to the right, a radio crackles nearer: “—corridor sweep in thirty seconds. Confirm vent points.”

You start walking—heads down, pace clipped, like you’re late and annoyed about it. Under the fluorescents your shadows look too sharp, like they don’t quite match your feet.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** Beige Authority service corridor; cold tile underfoot; a blinking red camera dome above the FILES/Compliance door.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Grille exit: successful  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Authority patrol: approaching right bend  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Camera: covers your emergence  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Wrong gurgle: at the wall

### Turn 92 [PLAYER]

I keep walking but angle us tight under the camera’s blind spot, murmuring, “Eyes down—act pissed, like you got called in.”  

As we pass beneath it, I tug my jacket collar up and lift my forearm like I’m checking a watch, trying to block the lens for a beat. Then I steer us straight to the “RECORDS / COMPLIANCE” door and try the handle like I’ve got every right to be there. “Myra—do you have a badge, key, anything. Now.”

*Agent reasoning: The camera is the immediate threat—if it caught us coming out, we’re done. I can’t fight a whole corridor, so I’ll buy seconds: get us out of its line, then create a “normal” reason we’re here by ducking into COMPLIANCE like we belong. Also, the water-sound at the wall makes me want solid doors between us and it.*

### Turn 93 [GAME]

You slide tight under the camera’s corner—close enough that the lens can’t see much but jacket shoulder and fluorescent glare. The collar-up/forearm “watch check” buys you a beat; the red blink continues, indifferent, but you’ve cut the clearest view of your faces.

You hit the **RECORDS / COMPLIANCE** door like you own it and try the handle.

Locked. Solid commercial latch—no rattle, no mercy.

Myra’s hand is already in her pocket. She produces a thin, scuffed **Harbor Authority badge card** on a retractable clip and a small ring with two keys. “Badge is mine,” she whispers, voice tight. “Keys—records cages and supply, not always the main. Main’s usually a swipe.” She glances at Vell, then back at you. “If the swipe fails, I can get us in if you can give me *ten seconds* and cover the click.”

From the bend to your right, the approaching patrol’s light sweeps the corridor wall—closer now. A radio crackle carries: “Compliance door—check it. Harrow wants those exports seized.”

And from inside the wall behind you, the gurgle shifts—like something wet dragging itself along sheet metal toward the grille you came through. The corridor’s air turns briefly cold and salty, then normal again, as if the building swallowed.

Vell keeps his eyes down, jaw clenched hard enough to tremble. “They see me, I’m done,” he breathes without moving his lips.

Myra raises the badge toward the reader panel beside the handle—waiting on your signal.

### Turn 94 [PLAYER]

“Do it—swipe.” I shift my body to shield the reader and Myra’s hands from the camera, then straighten up like I’m supposed to be here, one hand on the handle like I’m impatient.  

To Vell, low: “If they look at you, you’re Facilities. Stare at the floor and hold your breath.”  

I angle my head toward the bend and call out in a bored, annoyed tone, “Compliance—door’s acting up. Give us ten seconds.”

*Agent reasoning: We’re seconds from being seen; a clean swipe is fastest, but I need a fallback and a way to sell our presence if the patrol rounds the corner. I’ll position us to look official, get the swipe done, and be ready to body-block or talk.*

### Turn 95 [GAME]

Myra swipes.

For half a second nothing happens—then the reader gives a reluctant **green blink** and a soft chirp. The latch clicks open under your impatient hand. You pull the door inward just enough to make it look like routine access, and you slip all three of you through in a tight stack.

Your bored call toward the bend lands: “Compliance—door’s acting up. Give us ten seconds.”

A flashlight beam pauses at the corner. A man’s voice answers, irritated and distracted, like he doesn’t want paperwork tonight: “Make it five. Harrow’s taking copies—Rook wants *everything*.” The beam moves on, not committing to the turn yet.

Inside, the **FILES/Compliance room** is colder than the hall—metal shelving, a workstation with a docked terminal, and a low cabinet line along the back wall. The door shuts behind you with a muted click that sounds too loud in the quiet. Through the small wired-glass window, you see the patrol’s light sweep past without stopping.

Vell bends forward, hands on knees, holding his breath exactly like you told him, eyes pinned to the tile.

Myra doesn’t celebrate. She’s already moving—whispering fast: “If they’re ‘taking copies,’ they’re either pulling the last three nights’ exports or rewriting incident timestamps. If we don’t grab what we need now, it’s gone.” She glances at the back cabinets like she knows which one lies.

Then you notice it: one of the lower drawers along the back line sits *too* flush, like it’s been reseated carefully. The metal around it has faint scrape marks where someone’s pried and then made it pretty again.

In the wall, far behind you, that wrong gurgle dulls—like it’s lost your scent for a moment—then the buoy-bell rhythm taps once, faintly, through the pipes.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** Inside FILES/Compliance; metal shelves and a terminal; corridor light passing behind wired glass.

### Turn 96 [PLAYER]

I move straight to the too-flush drawer and run my fingers along the scrape marks, then ease it open with the knife tip like I’m defusing a bomb. “Myra—pull whatever links exports to Harrow and Rook, timestamps, manifests—anything you can photograph or pocket. Vell, eyes on that window—if light stops, you hiss.”

*Agent reasoning: We’ve got a tiny window before the patrol circles back; the reseated drawer screams “hidden cache.” I trust Myra’s instincts on records, but I’m watching the door and that sea-sound—grab proof fast and prep an exit.*

### Turn 97 [GAME]

Your fingers find the scrape marks—and the moment bare skin brushes the cold metal edge, it’s like the drawer bites back.

Cold salt fire races up your arm in a numb, flooding rush. Your hand spasms; the knife tip skitters with a sharp *tink* against the cabinet face. For an instant you taste brine and pennies, and the building’s pipes answer with a faint, wrong **bell-tap**—not from outside, but *through the walls*, like the harbor is counting you from inside the Authority’s bones.

The drawer doesn’t spring; it *gives*—just a hair—like something inside was meant to be found, but only after it knows your name.

Myra snaps her head toward you, seeing your hand go rigid. “Rafe—don’t touch it—” she hisses, then forces herself back to the terminal, hands moving fast anyway. She yanks open a desk side tray, finds a stubby admin camera and a coiled cable. “I can’t ‘pull’ without leaving a trace, but I can *capture* what’s on-screen and whatever’s in that drawer if you can get it open.”

Vell is at the wired-glass window, one eye on the corridor. He doesn’t speak—just raises two fingers: patrol light is still moving, but slower now, like someone’s reconsidering the turn.

Inside the drawer, as you ease it with the knife tip, you see a thin bundle: **carbon forms** with Harbor Authority “accident” headers, pre-stamped and signed in a tight hand—time-of-death fields already filled with times that don’t match the incident numbers. Tucked beneath them: a **tide chart strip** with minute marks and a penciled note: **PIER NINE / INTAKE / “RETURNED”**.

Your arm keeps burning cold. The air in the room thickens, fog-damp without fog—like the ward you tripped is trying to locate you through the building.

If you don’t break line-of-sight with this cabinet and get that hand rinsed and wrapped soon, the “call” is going to get louder.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** FILES/Compliance back cabinets; metal drawer half-open; wired-glass window shows corridor sweep.

### Turn 98 [PLAYER]

I grit my teeth and hook the bundle of accident forms and the tide strip out with the knife tip into my jacket, keeping my bare fingers off the metal. “Myra—photo them, quick; no flash,” I mutter, then strip my bandana off and wrap my forearm tight, twisting it like a tourniquet.  

To Vell, low: “If that light stops, you *hiss* and we’re out—door or vent, I don’t care.” I lean close to Myra while she shoots the pics. “Pier Nine intake—‘returned’… you ever hear that phrase before?”

*Agent reasoning: The ward mark feels like a beacon—if I stay on the cabinet, whatever’s in the walls will find us. We need the evidence fast, get Myra’s photos, then rinse/wrap my arm and prepare to move before the patrol commits.*

### Turn 99 [GAME]

The knife tip hooks the bundle cleanly. You keep your skin off the metal and slide the **pre-stamped forms** and **tide strip** into your jacket. The moment they leave the drawer, the cold pressure in the room eases a fraction—like you took something a hook was set to hold.

Myra nods once, jaw tight, and raises the little admin camera. No flash—just the faintest shutter ticks as she frames the headers, the incident numbers, the impossible times-of-death, and the penciled **PIER NINE / INTAKE / “RETURNED”**. She angles the camera so the wired-glass window can’t catch the screen reflection.

You strip your bandana and cinch your forearm. The burn doesn’t stop, but it dulls from “screaming cold” to a steady, nauseating throb. Salt stings your nose as you twist the cloth tight; the ward mark under it feels like it’s trying to pulse in time with that wrong bell-tap in the pipes.

Vell stays glued to the window. The corridor light slows—then pauses. He inhales to hiss.

Before he can, a radio squawks outside, close: “—Rook wants Compliance sealed after pull. If the clerk’s in there, drag her out.” Boots stop just past the door; you can see the shadow line through the wired glass, broad-shouldered, lingering.

Myra answers your whisper without looking up from the camera. “Yeah,” she murmurs. “Facilities says ‘returned’ when the **intake screens** catch… things. Driftwood, bodies, whatever the pumps spit back out. But Tideglass uses it like a *term*. Like a name comes back into the ledger.” She swallows. “Pier Nine’s annex has an intake crawl. If they wrote it down to the minute, it’s not maintenance.”

She finishes the last photo and slips the camera into her pocket. “I can’t keep this badge hot forever. If they start checking swipes, they’ll see me.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** Back of FILES/Compliance; wired-glass window shows a stopped shadow at the corridor.

### Turn 100 [PLAYER]

I press a finger to Myra’s lips and whisper, “Pocket the badge—now,” then I step to the door and in a bored clerk voice call, “Compliance is empty—terminal’s locked out. You want me to wait for Harrow or go back to my station?”  

I glance around fast for a second exit—vent, service hatch, anything—and murmur to Myra, “Is there a back way out of this room?”

*Agent reasoning: Boots are right outside and “seal” means we’re about to be trapped; I’d rather gamble on misdirection than a fight. I’ll set up a believable “room’s empty” moment, then slip out the back if there is one, using Myra’s knowledge and keeping Vell from panicking.*

### Turn 101 [GAME]

Myra freezes at your finger, then exhales through her nose and slides **the Harbor Authority badge card** off her lanyard and into her inside pocket like it’s a live razor. Her eyes flick to the wired-glass window: the shadow outside shifts, listening.

You step to the door and put on that bored, put-upon clerk tone. “Compliance is empty—terminal’s locked out. You want me to wait for Harrow or go back to my station?”

A beat. Then a man answers from the hall—close enough you can hear the wet squeak of his rain gear. “Locked out?” Suspicious, but not certain. “Stand by. We’re sealing the room. Don’t touch anything.”

Another voice, farther back, radio-tinny: “Rook said nobody stands by. Sweep and clear. If it’s empty, prove it.”

The shadow at the window leans in; a flashlight beam tries to angle through the wired glass, turning it into a milky glare. Vell’s shoulders rise—he’s fighting the hiss down, throat tight.

You glance fast: along the **back wall**, behind the cabinets, there’s a narrow **service access panel**—painted the same dull gray as the wall, with two screws showing fresh tool marks. Above it, near the ceiling line, a **return vent grille** sits slightly crooked, one corner darker with damp.

Myra murmurs without moving her lips, eyes on the panel: “Back way—yeah. That panel goes into the service chase behind Compliance. But it’s tight and loud if the screws fight. The vent’s worse—drops into the wrong ducting unless you know the turn.” She swallows. “If they open this door, they’ll see Vell first.”

Outside, the door handle tests once—gentle, like they’re checking if it’s latched—then stops. Someone’s deciding whether to key in or force it.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** Inside FILES/Compliance; door to corridor east; service panel on back wall; vent near ceiling.

### Turn 102 [PLAYER]

Without turning my head, I murmur, “Panel. Now. Vell first,” then I plant myself at the door and call out, still bored, “You want me to open it for your sweep or you gonna break it and write me up for it?”  

I slip my knife to Myra hilt-first. “Use this—quiet as you can,” and with my free hand I tug Vell back toward the cabinets, ready to shove him through the moment the panel gives.

*Agent reasoning: The patrol’s about to come in and Vell will get spotted; the service panel is our quickest hidden exit, even if it’s loud. I’ll buy seconds at the door while Myra works the screws, then shove Vell through first.*

### Turn 103 [GAME]

Myra takes the knife hilt-first, face gone flat with focus. She drops to a knee behind the cabinets, shoulders hunched to hide the motion, and sets the blade tip into the first screw head.

At the door you keep the bored edge in your voice. “You want me to open it for your sweep or you gonna break it and write me up for it?”

It works—halfway. The voice outside snorts, annoyed. “Open it. Now. Hands where I can see ’em.”

The handle shifts again, firmer this time, like they’ve got a key and are done negotiating.

Behind you, the knife turns with a soft, gritty *skritch*. The screw gives—too loud in the hush—and the service panel shivers. Myra pauses, listens, then keeps going. Second screw fights; she leans her weight into it, careful not to strip it. Vell is right there, breathing through his nose, eyes on the panel opening like it’s oxygen.

Through the wired glass, the flashlight beam cuts off, replaced by a face pressed close—distorted by the mesh. A Harbor Authority officer, young and jumpy, scanning for movement. His radio whispers: “—Harrow’s sweep is personal tonight. Nobody slips.”

You tug Vell back hard; he bumps the cabinet, metal ticking. The officer’s head snaps toward the sound.

Myra finally frees the second screw. The panel edge pops loose just enough to get fingers under—she peels it back a handspan and cold, stale air spills out from the service chase, smelling of dust and brackish damp. It’s tight, but it’s real.

Outside, the key scrapes in the lock.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** FILES/Compliance door east; service panel opening behind the back cabinets, low and cramped.

The pressure in your wrapped forearm pulses once, like the ward recognizes the “back way,” and somewhere deep in the building a pipe gives a tiny, wrong **bell-tap** in answer.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Service panel: opened (narrow)  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Door: key in lock

### Turn 104 [PLAYER]

I throw my voice at the door, sharper now like I’m offended. “You want my hands where you can see ’em? Fine—count to three and I’ll open it. If you key it and snap the latch, I’m not signing the damage report.”

Without looking back, I grab Vell by the collar and shove him down into the service panel opening. “Go. Crawl. Don’t stop.” Then I hiss to Myra, “You’re next—evidence tight,” and keep my body squared to the door, ready to yank the panel closed behind her the second she slips in.

*Agent reasoning: The door’s about to open, so I need to buy seconds and get Vell into the chase; if anyone gets caught, it can’t be Myra with the evidence. I’ll keep the guard’s attention on me while silently pushing Vell through, then Myra.*

### Turn 105 [GAME]

“Count to three and I’ll open it,” you snap, offended on purpose. “If you key it and snap the latch, I’m not signing the damage report.”

On the other side of the door there’s a half-second of silence—then the officer bites, irritation overruling caution. “Fine. Three.” The key stops turning. The handle stills.

You don’t look back. You hook Vell by the collar and drive him into the service opening. He goes on hands and knees, shoulders scraping the frame, then disappears into the service chase with a wet inhale and a whisper of fabric on dust. You hear him once: a muffled, “I’m—good,” already crawling.

Myra’s right behind him, tight as a wire. She tucks the camera and papers hard against her ribs, then slides in sideways. The panel edge nicks her sleeve; she doesn’t react. As she vanishes into the dark, she breathes, barely audible: “Pier Nine annex has a pump-yard keybox—if they haven’t changed it.”

The corridor voice starts again, louder, committed: “Two—”

You yank the panel back into place as quietly as you can, but the metal kisses the frame with a soft *tink*. In the same instant, the lock clicks—someone outside can’t help themselves and twists the key anyway.

“—Three.”

The latch releases. The door begins to swing inward.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re in FILES/Compliance, squared to the east door; behind you, the re-seated service panel sits low behind cabinets, its screws missing, edges not quite flush.

The officer steps in fast with his flashlight up, catching your face and the empty space behind you. His eyes flick to the cabinets—then down to the panel seam, noticing the slight misalignment. “Where’s the clerk?” he demands, and his radio crackles as another set of boots approaches the threshold.

Outside, deeper in the building, that wrong buoy-bell cadence seems to echo in the pipes—like the harbor itself is keeping time with this breach.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Vell: in service chase  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Myra: in service chase  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Door: opened by patrol

### Turn 106 [PLAYER]

I lift both hands, palms out, and step forward into his light to crowd the doorway. “Clerk’s on break—bathroom down the hall. You want him, go yell at Facilities; I’m just here because the terminal kicked me out.” I angle my body to hide the cabinet line and jerk my chin at the officer’s radio. “You sealing this room or doing a full sweep? ’Cause if you’re sealing it, you’re already contaminating it standing in my doorway.”

*Agent reasoning: I need to keep their attention on me and away from the panel seam; the best play is to act like an irritated, low-level employee with nothing to hide, and physically block their line to the cabinets while giving them a plausible “clerk” explanation.*

### Turn 107 [GAME]

You crowd the doorway with your hands up and your shoulders squared, eating the flashlight beam so it can’t rake the cabinets clean. The officer’s posture shifts—half reflex, half relief—because you’ve given him something procedural to hold onto.

“Clerk’s on break—bathroom down the hall,” you say, and when you needle him about contamination, his jaw tightens. He glances at his own boots on the threshold like you’ve caught him stealing.

Immediate outcome: he doesn’t push past you. He backs a half-step into the corridor and tries to regain authority with rules.

“Don’t get cute,” he says, but his voice wobbles. “We’re… securing. Not your job to talk chain-of-custody.” Then, lower, like he hates himself for saying it: “Harrow wants the logs and the tags. Anything stamped. Anything with Calder on it.”

Your name in his mouth lands heavy; the salt-burned skin under your wrap prickles.

Behind him, another pair of boots arrives—older, heavier. A second officer leans into view, face set, eyes already scanning past you for angles. He notices the slight mis-seat of the cabinet line, not the panel itself—yet. He doesn’t raise a flashlight; he raises a hand like he’s calming a dog.

“Rook’s order was clear,” the older one says to the younger, eyes on you. “We don’t break seals. We don’t make noise. We take what Compliance already exported.” He flicks his gaze to the terminal area. “You. Contractor. Step out. Door stays open.”

In the corridor, the radio on the younger officer’s shoulder hisses with overlapping traffic—Union pickets at Pier Nine, a “memorial crowd,” and an instruction repeated twice: “No civilians in the sweep lanes.”

**Sensory grounding:** You’re at the east doorway of FILES/Compliance, body blocking the sightline; corridor fog-cold air washes in, smelling of wet wool and antiseptic.

**Environmental pressure:** If they enter and start a “proper” sweep, someone will notice the missing screws; if they pull you into the hall, you lose control of the room’s sightlines.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Patrol: hesitates, procedural  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Calder name flagged on radio  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Second officer arrived, assertive

### Turn 108 [PLAYER]

I let my hands lower a fraction like I’m swallowing my pride, and I edge one step into the hall—only enough to satisfy the order—keeping my shoulder and hip braced in the doorway. “Door stays open, sure. But you want what Compliance exported, it’s not in the room—it’s in the queue. You drag your boots in there and you’ll have nothing but dust and a complaint.”  

I tip my chin at the younger officer’s radio. “Harrow wants stamped logs with my name on ’em? Then tell me what case number he’s chasing and I’ll pull the export from the terminal history—right here, in your light—no sweep, no noise.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re sniffing around my name and that cabinet line; if I step out cleanly, they’ll see the panel and Myra/Vell are dead. I’ll comply just enough to look harmless, then bait them into focusing on the terminal and “exports” while I keep my body between them and the cabinets—maybe even volunteer to fetch the “exported” packet so they don’t sweep.*

### Turn 109 [GAME]

You give them the inch they demanded—one step into the corridor—without giving up the doorway. Your shoulder stays planted against the jamb like a wedge.

**Immediate outcome:** it lands. The older officer’s eyes flick from your braced hip to the room behind you, weighing the hassle of forcing entry against the neatness of “export history.” He makes a small, decisive motion with two fingers: hold.

The younger officer swallows, touches his radio as if it’s hot. “Case number…” he starts, then hesitates—because saying it out loud feels like admitting there is a case. He glances to the older one for permission.

The older officer answers instead, voice low and clipped: “There isn’t a case number. Not yet. That’s the point.” Then, after a beat: “We’re collecting anything that *creates* a case. Tags, stamps, time-of-death discrepancies. Anything that makes Harrow look like she missed something.”

That tells you two things at once: they’re not here to investigate; they’re here to pre-empt.

He steps closer, stopping just outside arm’s reach, keeping his body between you and the corridor traffic. “You pull export history in our light, you don’t touch the stamp kit, and you don’t close that door. If you try to get clever, I’ll have you cuffed and we’ll open every panel in this wing.”

The younger officer finally blurts what he knows, like he can’t hold it: “They’re calling it a ‘predictive paperwork ring.’ Tags showing up before deaths. Harrow thinks somebody’s forging Authority time.” His gaze darts to your wrapped forearm and then away.

**Sensory grounding:** Corridor fluorescents buzz overhead; cold air from the hall lifts the paper-dust smell out of Compliance.

Behind the older officer, the hall is starting to clog—more boots, a clipboard inspector with shaking hands, and somewhere distant a muffled chant of Union voices bleeding in from the waterfront side. The radio squawks again: “Pier Nine crowd forming. Tideglass candles. Keep sweep lanes clear.”

Time pressure tightens: if they decide you’re stalling, they’ll breach the room; if you comply, you’re at a terminal with their eyes on your hands while Myra and Vell crawl blind behind the wall.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Patrol pauses; conditional compliance  
**STATUS UPDATES:** No case number; pre-emptive grab

### Turn 110 [PLAYER]

I nod once, tight-jawed. “Fine. You want it in your light, you get it in your light.”  

I step backward into Compliance slow, palms still open, and angle my body so I’m between their line of sight and the cabinets. “You—” I point at the younger officer’s radio hand, “—keep that light on my hands. You—” to the older one, “—tell Harrow if she wants to make me a problem, she can come do it to my face.”  

Then I move to the terminal deliberately, fingers careful and visible. “Show me what time window you want—last 24, last week, or since the last Pier Nine incident?” I pause, eyes flicking to his. “And who’s calling it ‘predictive’—Harrow, or somebody above her?”

*Agent reasoning: If I stall, they’ll tear the wall open and catch Myra and Vell. If I comply, I can keep them out of the room and maybe learn what Harrow’s really after—plus buy time for the crawl. I’ll play cooperative, keep my hands visible, and steer them toward a harmless “export history” view while I listen for anything behind the panel.*

### Turn 111 [GAME]

The older officer lets you back into Compliance without following—exactly as you framed it: your room, their light. The younger one stays in the doorway, flashlight trained on your hands so hard it washes the terminal keys pale.

**Immediate outcome:** you get to the terminal and wake it without being grabbed or pushed off the station. The older officer stays just outside the threshold, watching the cabinet line over your shoulder like he’s trying to see through you.

The terminal’s screen flickers from sleep to a Compliance login banner—then a yellow notice: **TEMP EXPORT QUEUE: LOCKED (SWEEP AUTHORITY)**. Someone already put a leash on it.

“You’re buying yourself time,” the older officer says, not quite accusing, not quite admiring. When you mention Harrow coming to your face, his mouth twitches. “Commissioner doesn’t do face-to-face with contractors. She does signatures.”

You ask for the window and who’s calling it predictive.

The younger officer answers before the older can stop him: “Last seventy-two. Since the fog started. And… it wasn’t Harrow who said ‘predictive.’ That came down from Annex—Compliance Oversight. They’re the ones asking for ‘pre-incident tags.’” He realizes he’s said too much and clamps his jaw shut, knuckles whitening on the radio.

The older officer’s eyes cut to him—warning. Then back to you. “You pull what you can. If it’s locked, you show us the lock. No tricks.”

**Sensory grounding:** You’re at the Compliance terminal on the north wall; behind you, your hip still blocks the cabinet seam, while corridor air breathes in cold and damp through the open door.

In the hall, that clipboard inspector you clocked earlier edges closer, pretending to read but listening—his hands still shaking like he’s reciting someone else’s script. The radio spits Pier Nine again: “Memorial crowd—candles—Union on approach.”

Somewhere behind the wall, a faint *scrape* travels through the service chase—Vell or Myra shifting—and the older officer’s head tilts a fraction, like he heard it too but can’t place it.

**Status updates:** Terminal: export queue locked  
**Status updates:** “Annex Oversight” implicated  
**Status updates:** Patrol: holding doorway open

### Turn 112 [PLAYER]

I tilt the screen slightly so they can see the yellow notice clear. “There. Locked by Sweep Authority—so if you want ‘no tricks,’ you’re looking at the leash.”

I keep my hands visible and click into whatever the terminal will show without credentials—system status, audit banner, access request—then glance back at the older officer. “Who signed the sweep token? Name, not rank. If Annex Oversight is steering this, I want it on record you asked me to pull something I’m not authorized to touch.”

I raise my voice a notch toward the hall, like I’m complaining to the building. “And tell your clipboard friend to stop hovering—if he’s here to witness, he can witness from the doorway.”

*Agent reasoning: The lock notice gives me a clean, non-suspicious reason to keep them at the threshold while I probe for any visible metadata or audit trails; I also want to needle “Annex Oversight” without spooking them into a full sweep, and cover the scrape behind the wall by redirecting attention to procedure.*

### Turn 113 [GAME]

You cant the monitor so the yellow **TEMP EXPORT QUEUE: LOCKED (SWEEP AUTHORITY)** warning sits dead-center in their flashlight beam.

**Immediate outcome:** it forces the older officer to acknowledge—out loud—that you’re not stonewalling. He leans in just enough to read it, then straightens, irritation redirected away from you and toward whoever tightened the leash.

“Yeah,” he mutters. “That’s a sweep token.”

You keep your hands clean and visible, clicking only what a locked terminal will give you: a system status pane, an access-denied audit banner, and a “Request Temporary Authorization” screen. The audit banner helpfully lists the last policy push:

**POLICY UPDATE SOURCE: ANNEX / OVERSIGHT**  
**TOKEN: SWP-12**  
**ISSUED BY: K. SEDGE (DIGITAL SIGN)**  
**SCOPE: COMPLIANCE EXPORTS / INCIDENT TAGS / LEDGER IMAGES**  
Most of the rest is hashed strings and timestamps—enough to be evidence, not enough to be a full confession.

The older officer’s face tightens at the name. “Sedge,” he says, like it tastes wrong. “Keep that screen where my guy can see it.”

When you raise your voice at the hovering clipboard inspector, the man flinches as if you slapped him. He takes two quick steps back to the doorway line, trying to look official while his hands keep trembling. “Witnessing,” he says too fast. “Just—documenting compliance.”

The younger officer doesn’t move his flashlight off your hands, but his eyes flick to the audit line and stick on **K. SEDGE**. His radio hisses again—Pier Nine, candles, Union movement—and for a second the fog-cold air in the hall smells sharply of wet wax, like the memorial’s already bleeding into this building.

Behind you, through the wall, there’s another faint *tick-scrape* in the service chase—careful, controlled—like someone repositioning a tool to avoid making noise.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Sweep token signer: K. Sedge  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Annex Oversight confirmed on audit  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Clipboard inspector pushed back

### Turn 114 [PLAYER]

I tap the screen right on “ISSUED BY: K. SEDGE,” then look at the older officer. “So you’re here on Sedge’s leash, not Harrow’s—good to know. You want something you can take upstairs? Photograph this audit line and the token scope, then go ask Oversight why they’re locking exports in the middle of a sweep.”

Without turning my head, I drag my knuckles once along the cabinet edge—soft, deliberate—then keep my hands up on the keyboard. “If you insist on an export, you’ll need a live authorization. You calling Sedge, or you want me to file the request so it’s stamped with your names?”

I glance to the doorway at the clipboard guy. “And you—write down exactly what you saw: access denied, sweep token SWP-12, signer K. Sedge. No ‘contractor interference’ bullshit.”

*Agent reasoning: Sedge’s name is leverage, and the lock buys me a procedural shield; I need to keep the cops focused on paperwork while I quietly signal Myra/Vell to freeze and find an exit.*

### Turn 115 [GAME]

Your finger taps **K. SEDGE** and the older officer’s jaw works once, like he’s grinding down whatever he wants to say.

**Immediate outcome:** you successfully pivot the pressure off “export now” and onto “authorization or evidence.” The younger officer lowers his light just enough to free one hand and snaps two quick photos—audit line, then token scope—flash off, practiced. The clipboard inspector, pale and sweating, scribbles exactly what you dictated, eyes never leaving the screen long enough to think.

The older officer doesn’t bite on “Sedge’s leash,” but he doesn’t deny it either. “Don’t get cute, Calder,” he says. “Sedge signs the token. Harrow signs the consequences.” Then, quieter, more honest: “Oversight’s been stepping on toes all week. People disappear into Annex meetings and come back… blank.”

Your knuckles drag along the cabinet edge—soft, deliberate. The metal gives a faint *ting* under your skin, and from behind the wall a perfectly-timed *answering scrape* returns, like someone caught the signal and shifted position.

The older officer’s head snaps toward the cabinet seam. His eyes narrow. “What was that?”

The younger officer’s radio crackles over his own tension: “Pier Nine memorial crowd is at capacity. Union pickets pushing through. Authority units redeploying—need bodies on the piers.” The words “need bodies” land wrong in this building.

The clipboard inspector blurts, trying to be useful: “Access denied, SWP-12, signer K. Sedge—recorded,” and holds up his page like a shield.

The older officer exhales through his nose, weighing the corridor call against whatever he thinks he heard in your room. “File the request,” he decides, as if making it procedural makes it safe. “Stamped with our names. If Oversight wants to rubber-stamp it, they can do it while the whole pier’s on fire.”

He steps half a pace back into the hall, thumb on his own radio now, and you catch the first real crack in his control: he’s scared of calling Sedge directly.

**Sensory grounding:** Compliance’s cold fluorescent hum sits above you; the open doorway to the east breathes fog-damp air and radio noise into the room.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Audit photographed; notes recorded  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Authorization request demanded  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Pier Nine redeploy order escalates

*Triggered: secret_Ward The Vent Screws_0_d54a6b, secret_Ward The Bend And Call_0_dc9728, secret_Ward The Bend And Call_1_b33c97, fail_Ward The Bend And Call_1_922b07, watcher_Ward The Bend And Call_1_ed39b0*

### Turn 116 [PLAYER]

I let my hands hover, palms open. “Old building. Pipes talk. You’re jumpy because Pier Nine’s lighting up.”  

I click into the authorization request and start filling it out slow and visible. “Give me your names and badge numbers for the record—both of you—and your unit. Then take your redeploy and get out of my doorway before you ‘contaminate’ something.”  

Without looking back, I murmur under my breath toward the cabinet seam, “Hold. Don’t breathe,” and keep typing.

*Agent reasoning: Filing the request buys time and keeps them procedural, but the older officer heard the scrape—if he gets suspicious, he’ll breach. I need to calm him, redirect him to the pier redeploy, and quietly signal Myra/Vell to freeze while I submit the request with their names attached.*

### Turn 117 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** Filing the request works—slow, visible, undeniable. The older officer gives you what you asked for, but he does it like he’s paying a toll.

“Rolan Vex,” he says. “Badge 3-118. Unit: Night Compliance Liaison.” He points his chin at the younger one without looking away from you.  
“Eli Marr,” the younger officer answers, voice tight. “Badge 5-044. Patrol Detachment C.”

The clipboard inspector hesitates, then adds—too quickly—“Tomas Pell. Oversight intake.” Not a badge number. Not quite a lie, but not the whole truth either.

You type their names in, and the terminal accepts them into the request fields. When you hit the “Reason” box, the cursor blinks like a heartbeat. The older officer watches your hands, then the cabinet seam, then the hallway, caught between Pier Nine and whatever’s behind that wall.

**Sensory grounding:** You’re still at the Compliance terminal on the north wall; the open doorway to the east spills corridor fog and radio chatter across the floor.

Your murmur—“Hold. Don’t breathe”—lands perfectly. The faint movement behind the cabinet dies instantly. No scrape, no shift, not even the tiny settling noise of metal cooling. Whoever’s in that chase heard you and obeyed.

Vex’s radio squawks again: Pier Nine, units redeploying, Union pressure building. Vex grimaces. “They want us on the piers. And Sedge wants this room clean.” He looks at Pell. “You got a badge number, intake?”

Pell’s pen freezes mid-stroke. “Annex doesn’t issue—” he starts, then stops as if he’s remembered who’s listening. “I’m assigned. That’s all.”

Vex makes a decision you can see: he steps fully into the hall, tugging Marr with him by the shoulder—clearing your doorway like you demanded, but keeping Pell at the threshold as a “witness” he can blame later. “Request goes up,” Vex says. “No exports until Oversight answers. And Calder—if you’re playing games with hidden people in walls, don’t. Annex will drown you in paperwork before the water does.”

As they peel away, Pell lingers one beat too long, eyes flicking to the cabinet seam like he’s trying to memorize it.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Authorization request: submitted draft  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Officer IDs recorded  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Doorway partially cleared

### Turn 118 [PLAYER]

I type in the “Reason” field: “Requesting temporary authorization to view/export audit history for Compliance exports; export queue locked by SWP-12 issued by K. Sedge; officers Vex (3-118) and Marr (5-044) present; witness Tomas Pell (Oversight intake) present; access currently denied.” Then I hit submit and swivel the screen toward Pell. “Read it. Out loud. If you’re ‘assigned,’ you can at least confirm what you witnessed.”

I stand and take one step toward the doorway, just enough to crowd his space without touching him. “Now move. Pier Nine’s calling bodies—go be useful somewhere that isn’t my wall.”

*Agent reasoning: Pell’s the real problem—he’s Oversight and he’s clocking the cabinet seam. I need to lock him into the record, push him out, and buy Myra/Vell a clean exit while the pier chaos pulls the cops away.*

### Turn 119 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** the request submits clean—no error, no “pending draft.” The screen flashes **SUBMITTED: ROUTED TO ANNEX OVERSIGHT / QUEUE SWP-12** and stamps it with a time that makes your stomach tighten: **00:41:09**. For half a second, the system clock at the corner disagrees—**00:39:12**—then snaps to match, like it was corrected remotely.

You swivel the monitor toward Pell.

Tomas Pell’s throat bobs. He leans in, eyes darting once to the hall where Vex and Marr are already moving fast toward Pier Nine orders. Then he reads, out loud, exactly what you wrote—voice thin but clear—right up to **“access currently denied.”**

When you step in and crowd him, he backpedals without you touching him. “Fine—confirmed,” he says, and there’s a flicker of anger under the fear. “But you don’t understand what you just routed. Annex doesn’t ‘review’ these. They *take custody* of them.”

**Sensory grounding:** You’re in the Compliance room, terminal on the north wall; the doorway east opens to a fog-wet service corridor that smells of cold metal and copier toner.

Behind you, the cabinet seam stays dead-still—too still. Whoever’s in the chase is holding their breath like you told them to. In the corridor, Vex barks into his radio as he goes: “Detachment C redeploy—Pier Nine.” Marr’s boots slap away, fast.

Pell edges sideways to clear your doorway, but as he passes he drops his voice—something he can plausibly claim you “overheard,” not that he told you. “Sedge is a signature. Not a person. Whoever has the stamp is moving tags through Compliance before the bodies surface. If Pier Nine’s full of candles, they’ll want a crowd to hide the intake.”

Then he’s gone down the hall, pen scratching as he walks, leaving a faint smear of ink on the doorframe where his clipboard grazed it.

In the quiet he leaves behind, your phone vibrates again—blocked number—once, then stops.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Authorization request routed Annex  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Pell verbal confirmation logged  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Pier Nine redeploy underway

### Turn 120 [PLAYER]

I snatch my phone and answer the blocked number low and sharp. “Talk fast—who is this, and why’d my system clock just get corrected?”  

Then I pivot to the cabinet seam and whisper, “You can breathe—quiet. Who are you, and are you hurt?”

*Agent reasoning: Pell’s warning and the clock correction scream interference; the blocked call could be the only real lead. I also can’t leave whoever’s in the service chase to get “taken into custody.”*

### Turn 121 [GAME]

The blocked call picks up on the second ring—no greeting, just wet breathing and a buoy-bell *clang* faint in the background, slightly off-beat.

“Calder,” a woman says, voice filtered like she’s speaking through cloth. Not Myra. Older than Myra. Controlled. “Stop looking at clocks. That correction wasn’t your system—Annex pushed a port-wide time sync. They’re aligning reports to a tide window.”

You keep it low and sharp; she answers like she’s been waiting for exactly that question. “Because your request hit the queue. Because you wrote names into it. Because you’re in the building that feeds Pier Nine.”

A pause, then: “Don’t go to the memorial. And don’t trust anyone who says ‘Sedge’ like it’s a person.”

Before you can pin her down, you catch a second voice far away—male, barking—then the woman hisses, “They’re sweeping Compliance next,” and the line goes dead. Your screen immediately shows **NO CALLER ID** like it never happened.

You pivot to the cabinet seam and whisper. For a beat nothing moves—then a slow exhale seeps through the crack, careful as a confession.

“I’m… I’m here,” a man whispers back. Young. Hoarse. “Don’t—don’t open it. They’ll hear.” He swallows, and you hear the tiny click of teeth. “I’m not hurt bad. Just—cold. My name’s Corin. Annex runner. They sent me to pull your request before it routed, and I couldn’t. So I hid.”

**Sensory grounding:** You’re still in the Compliance room, terminal glow on your hands; the east doorway is open to the fog-wet corridor, and somewhere deeper in the building a service cart wheel squeals once, then stops.

Corin’s voice tightens. “They’ve got a stamp kit down there that can backdate anything. Bodies, tags, times. If you stay in this room when the sweep hits, they’ll make you the witness and the culprit.”

From the corridor, distant boots pick up—more than two sets—moving with purpose, radios murmuring. Not Vex and Marr’s hurried retreat; this is a different cadence, slower, coordinated.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Blocked caller warns: time sync  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Hidden Annex runner identified (Corin)

### Turn 122 [PLAYER]

I kill the terminal glow to a dim idle screen and slide my phone into my pocket, then whisper at the seam, “Corin—listen. Is there an exit from that chase? Another room, a hatch, anything—yes or no.”

I ease the door toward mostly-closed, leaving a thin crack to watch the hall, and murmur, “If they come in, don’t move. Don’t cough.” Then, low like a promise, “If there’s a way out, I’ll get you out—just tell me where.”

*Agent reasoning: Sweep team’s coming and Corin’s trapped; I need to keep him alive and keep myself from being boxed in, but I can’t blow the cabinet or I’ll get us both tagged. I’ll buy seconds by making the room look empty/normal, then slip Corin out through the service chase if there’s an exit, otherwise I’ll hide him better and get ready to stall them.*

### Turn 123 [GAME]

You thumb the terminal down to an idle dim—enough that it stops painting your face in blue—and pocket the phone. The room feels smaller immediately, like you just turned off a lighthouse.

At the cabinet seam, Corin answers in a breath-thin whisper: “Yes. There’s a service chase run. Two ways.” He pauses like he’s mapping it by touch. “Right branch goes to a painted grille—dumps into the corridor by the pump house yard. Left branch goes up to a ladder junction… but there’s a hatch with a security screw. They sealed it last week.”

You ease the Compliance door toward mostly-closed. The latch doesn’t catch; it rests there with a narrow crack that frames the corridor like a slit-sight.

**Sensory grounding:** From your crack of hallway, you see fog-beaded fluorescent light and hear rubber soles on wet concrete—steady, coordinated—coming from the south.

Two figures slide into view, not running: Harbor Authority sweep team, dark rain gear, radios low. One carries a flat black case the size of your tool case; the other has a clipboard with a red corner sticker—Oversight marking. Their voices are muted, professional.

“…SWP-12 queue just routed,” the clipboard one murmurs. “Sedge wants Compliance cleared before Pier Nine crowd hits peak.”

The one with the case stops outside your door and listens—head angled, like he’s trained to hear breathing. He tries your handle once, gently, as if checking whether you’re cooperative.

Inside the wall, Corin goes perfectly still. You can feel the tension in the silence he leaves behind.

From deeper in the corridor, another radio crackles: “Pier Nine memorial commencing. Union pickets on approach.” The sweep team doesn’t speed up; they tighten formation.

Corin’s whisper barely makes it through the seam, more urgent now: “If you’re getting me out, it’s the right branch—painted grille. But it’s loud if you pry it. And—Calder—Annex has ears in the chase. Not just me.”

The handle turns again, a fraction firmer, and the door shifts against your nearly-closed position—someone testing whether it’s blocked from inside.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Sweep team at doorway  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Corin confirms chase exits  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Pier Nine crowd building

### Turn 124 [PLAYER]

I pull the door open just enough to show my face and one shoulder, keeping my body in the gap like a brace. “Yeah? Compliance is in idle—exports are locked under SWP-12, routed to Annex ten minutes ago. If you’re here to ‘clear’ it, take it up with Oversight.”

Without looking back, I breathe toward the cabinet seam, barely moving my lips: “Right branch. Now. Quiet.”

Then, to the sweep team, I keep my tone flat and tired. “You want to inventory the room, do it from the threshold. No rummaging—anything you touch becomes chain-of-custody, and I’m not wearing your mess.”

*Agent reasoning: If I freeze, they’ll come in and start “clearing” with that black case; I need to control the first contact and buy Corin time. I’ll play irritated-but-compliant, keep them in the hall, and quietly signal Corin to head for the right branch while attention is on me.*

### Turn 125 [GAME]

You crack the door just enough to wedge yourself in the gap—face and shoulder out, body blocking the sightline into Compliance.

**Immediate outcome:** it works, partially. The sweep team doesn’t force past you, but they don’t retreat either.

The clipboard officer—rain hood up, red-corner sticker glaring—narrows his eyes. “Ten minutes ago?” he repeats, like he’s tasting the lie for grit. “Annex clock says four.” He tilts the clipboard so you can’t see what’s written. “SWP-12 is live. Oversight wants *everything* that touched the last three nights. That includes contractors who think chain-of-custody is a shield.”

The one with the black case shifts his stance to the side—subtle, trained—trying to get an angle past your shoulder into the room. He doesn’t step in, but his gaze hunts: desk, terminal glow, cabinet line.

**Sensory grounding:** you’re braced in the east doorway of FILES/Compliance; corridor south is filling with damp boot-noise and low radio hiss.

Behind you, you breathe toward the cabinet seam: *Right branch. Now. Quiet.* There’s the softest scrape—fabric on metal—as Corin starts moving inside the wall. No cough. No stumble.

The clipboard officer’s radio murmurs, and a third voice answers close by—another sweep member out of frame: “Pier Nine crowd at peak. Union contact says ‘Calder’ is in play.” The clipboard officer’s eyes flick to your throat, then to your hands.

“You can posture all you want,” he says, voice calm. “But if you’re refusing a sweep order, I log obstruction and Oversight makes you disappear into paperwork.”

The case-carrier finally speaks, low: “Open it wider. We’re not here for your pride. We’re here for the stamp kit and any blank tags.”

That’s the tell: they already suspect what’s in this room, and they’re checking whether you’ll flinch.

In the wall, the scrape stops. Corin’s movement has reached a pause point—likely the junction before that painted grille—waiting for a moment quiet enough to risk the last stretch.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Sweep team held at threshold  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Corin moving in chase

### Turn 126 [PLAYER]

I let out a slow, irritated breath and hold their eyes. “Stamp kit? Blank tags? Wrong room. This is Compliance exports—terminal, logs, and a mop bucket if you’re lucky.”  

I lift my hands where they can see them and jerk my chin at the red-sticker clipboard. “Show me the sweep order with my name on it, and the authorizing signature—right here, in the hall. Until then, you’re not crossing my threshold.”  

Without turning my head, I murmur toward the cabinet seam, barely audible: “Now. Go. Don’t stop.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re fishing for a reaction about stamps/tags and trying to angle past me; I need to keep them talking and stationary long enough for Corin to slip out the right branch, without giving them a reason to force entry.*

### Turn 127 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** Your demand buys you seconds—and it puts them on the back foot just enough for Corin to move.

The clipboard officer’s jaw tightens. He doesn’t show you the paper; instead he taps the red-corner sticker with a gloved finger like it *is* the signature. “Oversight authorization,” he says. “That’s the signature that matters tonight.” But he hesitates, because you’ve made it public, procedural, and loud in a hallway that carries sound.

The case-carrier’s eyes flick past you again, and you see the calculation: force it and it becomes a scene; wait and they might still get what they want with less noise. His radio crackles once—someone asking for status—then he answers, “At Compliance door. Contractor present.”

**Sensory grounding:** You’re braced in the FILES/Compliance doorway, corridor to your east and south slick with fog-damp, fluorescent buzz reflecting off wet concrete.

Behind you, at the cabinet seam, there’s the faintest *shhhk* of fabric and boot rubber—Corin committing to the right branch. It’s steady now, not stop-start. He’s moving like he’s memorized where every bolt head will snag a sleeve.

The clipboard officer leans in a fraction, voice dropping. “You know why we’re really here, Calder? Because someone’s printing time that doesn’t exist.” His eyes cut to the idle terminal glow behind you. “And because Pier Nine is about to ‘return’ something with your name attached.”

Down the corridor, another sweep member edges into view—female, cropped hair under her hood—holding a small evidence satchel already labeled with a blank line for **SUBJECT**. She doesn’t speak. She just watches your hands.

A new sound threads through the building: distant chanting carried by the fog, thin but unmistakable—Pier Nine’s memorial loudspeakers bleeding through the harbor air system. It makes the hallway feel like it’s listening.

Then, from inside the wall: a soft metallic *tick*—not a cough, not a stumble. More like a grille being touched, tested.

The case-carrier shifts closer, trying to crowd you without crossing the threshold. “Last chance,” he says. “Step aside and keep your license.”

**STATUS UPDATES:** Corin advancing right branch  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Sweep team stalling, probing  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Pier Nine memorial audio bleeding through

### Turn 128 [PLAYER]

I bark down the corridor, loud enough to carry, “Vex! Marr! Anybody—get eyes on Oversight sweep at Compliance. They won’t present an order.” Then I look back at the case-carrier and say flat, “You want me to step aside? Put the authorizing name and signature in my hand, or you can log whatever you want—I’m not giving you a quiet room.” Without turning, I breathe toward the seam, barely there: “Almost out—don’t rush it.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re trying to bait me into yielding or giving them a reason to escalate; I need to keep them talking and loud while Corin finishes the grille, and I need witnesses on record that they’re acting without a named order.*

### Turn 129 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Your shout flips the hallway from “quiet extraction” to “public incident.” The sweep team freezes for half a beat—long enough for the case-carrier to stop crowding you and key his radio. The clipboard officer’s composure cracks into irritation; he hadn’t wanted witnesses.

Down the corridor, a door opens hard. A voice answers—young, sharp: “This is Vex. Say again?” Footsteps start coming fast, not running but urgent, rubber soles slapping wet concrete.

The clipboard officer leans in, teeth barely showing. “You just made yourself a problem,” he says. Then, louder for anyone listening: “Contractor Calder is refusing compliance with Oversight sweep.” He angles his clipboard like he’s writing your name into a form that already exists.

Behind you—inside the wall—there’s a soft *clink* followed by a faint exhale that isn’t yours. Corin has reached the painted grille and is working it, carefully, trying not to make the pry-squeal. You can hear the metal flex a millimeter at a time.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re still braced in the FILES/Compliance doorway; to your right the corridor stretches toward the pump house yard, and fluorescent light skitters on puddles like oil.

The woman with the evidence satchel steps closer, stopping just short of your threshold. She finally speaks, voice neutral: “We can do this clean, Calder. Put the tool case on the floor and step back.” Her eyes drop to your key ring, then back up—like she knows Myra’s tag.

Vex’s footsteps get closer. Another voice trails behind him—older, tired, maybe Marr: “Oversight again? Christ.”

The case-carrier’s radio chirps with a new instruction, clipped and impatient: “If contractor obstructs, detain and secure room. No delays. Pier Nine priority.” He meets your eyes and you see the shift—permission granted.

He reaches for your shoulder—not to shove yet, but to claim contact, to make the next move “resisting.”

From the wall, Corin’s grille gives a tiny, decisive *tick*—the kind that means it’s finally loose enough to push.

**STATUS UPDATES:** Vex/Marr responding, closing fast  
**STATUS UPDATES:** Sweep authorized to detain

### Turn 130 [PLAYER]

I step into the touch instead of away, catching the case-carrier’s wrist with my left hand—firm, not twisting—holding it out where the whole corridor can see. “Don’t put hands on me,” I say loud, steady. “You detain without a posted order, it’s assault—get your supervisor on speaker, now.”

Without turning my head, I murmur toward the wall seam, barely moving my lips: “Push through. Pump house yard. Don’t look back.”

Then I raise my voice down the corridor toward the oncoming footsteps: “Vex—Marr—witness this. Oversight sweep is attempting to detain me without producing an order. I want names and badge numbers, right now.”

*Agent reasoning: If he touches me first, they can spin it as “resisting,” but I need to keep them in the hall until Corin slips out. I’ll control the contact, keep it loud for witnesses, and give Corin the last seconds.*

### Turn 132 [PLAYER]

I keep hold of his wrist, firm but not wrenching, and raise it a little higher where the cameras and the corridor can see. “Hands off. Supervisor on speaker—now. Name and badge number.”

Without turning, I breathe toward the seam, almost nothing: “Through the grille. Pump house yard. Go.”

Then I call down the hall at the approaching boots, “Vex—Marr—get here and watch this. Oversight is detaining without producing an order. I want witnesses and I want ID.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re moving to detain me and Corin’s seconds from the grille—if I keep it public and procedural, I buy him the last breath he needs and make it harder for Oversight to vanish me quietly.*

### Turn 134 [PLAYER]

I keep my grip steady but open—no twist, no shove—holding his wrist up in plain view. “Supervisor on speaker. Name and badge number, now,” I say loud enough for the corridor and cameras, then I glance toward the oncoming boots. “Vex, Marr—right here. Witness this.”

*Agent reasoning: Oversight’s trying to turn this into “resisting,” so I need witnesses and to keep my hands visible while buying Corin the last seconds to slip out.*

### Turn 136 [PLAYER]

I keep the case-carrier’s wrist held up where cameras can see, palm open so it’s clear I’m not twisting. “Supervisor on speaker. Name and badge number—now,” I say, loud and even. Without turning my head, I breathe toward the seam, “Through. Pump yard. Go,” then I call down the corridor, “Vex—Marr—get here and witness this, right now.”

*Agent reasoning: The hallway’s gone dead silent—either the sweep’s waiting for me to slip or Corin’s about to pop the grille. I need witnesses fast, keep my hands “clean,” and force their supervisor onto record while I buy Corin seconds.*

### Turn 137 [GAME]

Your grip and the raised wrist do what you intended: the case-carrier freezes in place, caught between the camera’s stare and your voice carrying down the corridor. His free hand hovers, then drops away from the latches like he’s afraid the tape’s already rolling.

He swallows. “Authority—Compliance courier,” he says too fast. “Badge—” He fumbles at his chest clip with shaking fingers, then thinks better of it and tries to angle his body so the number isn’t clean on camera.

Behind the painted grille seam, there’s the faintest scrape of fabric and shoe rubber on metal—someone committing to the crawl. The vent screws you loosened earlier vibrate once, then settle. The air that slips through smells like wet concrete and pump oil.

Down the corridor, boots answer—two sets, quick. Vex and Marr come into view through the fogged, buzzing docklight spill: Harbor Authority uniforms, rain-sheened caps, hands already near cuffs. They clock your hold, the raised wrist, the camera, and then the case.

Vex slows first, voice hard but careful. “Calder. Let him go.” He looks at the courier. “Dain Rook’s office sent you?” That name lands like a weight; Marr’s eyes flick toward the FILES/Compliance door, then back to you.

The courier blurts, “Inspector Rook said—said it’s a sweep priority. No order needed, it’s internal—” He stops when Marr steps closer and says quietly, “Say your badge number. Out loud. For the record.”

Somewhere deeper in the building, a phone starts ringing—muffled, persistent—like someone finally hit the line you demanded, or like the corridor itself is calling for backup. The buoy bell outside keeps its wrong, off-beat count through the walls.

**Status updates:**  
- Witnesses arrived: Vex, Marr  
- Courier rattled: Rook invoked

### Turn 138 [PLAYER]

I let the courier’s wrist go slow, hands up and open, but I stay planted in the threshold. “I’m not resisting, Vex. I’m documenting.”

I look straight at the courier. “Badge number. Now. And you—satchel—your name too.”

Then I nod at the ringing phone. “Marr, answer that and put it on speaker. If it’s Rook’s office, I want it recorded in front of witnesses.”

*Agent reasoning: Vex and Marr are my thin line between “incident” and “detainment.” I need them anchored on procedure and the cameras while buying Corin seconds. I’ll release the wrist to avoid giving Vex an excuse, but I’ll keep control of the narrative by demanding ID and calling the ringing line on speaker.*

### Turn 139 [GAME]

You ease the courier’s wrist down without a jerk, hands open and visible. Vex’s shoulders drop a fraction—still tense, but he clocks the “no resistance” and doesn’t rush you. You stay planted in the FILES/Compliance threshold; the courier can’t slip past without making it an on-camera shove.

The courier licks his lips, eyes flicking between Vex and the camera dome above the corridor junction. “Badge— 3-1-7-0,” he says, voice cracking on the last digit. “Name… Tollen. Eli Tollen.” He says it like it hurts.

The satchel—black, hard-sided, with a Harbor seal sticker half-peeled—gives a tiny, involuntary twitch as if someone inside the strap line is bracing. Tollen’s knuckles go white around it.

Marr steps past Vex, grabs the ringing wall phone mounted just left of the Compliance doorframe—its plastic slick with condensation—and snaps it up. “Harbor Authority, corridor post—” He pauses, looks at you, then hits speaker with his thumb.

Static. Then a woman’s voice, clipped and practiced. “Marr. Patch to Inspector Rook. Now.” A beat, a breath like paper sliding in a file. “And stop Calder from contaminating Compliance.”

Vex’s gaze hardens at the phrasing—*contaminating*—like he’s heard it used before when someone wanted a person erased from a scene. He glances at Tollen. “Courier doesn’t enter without an order logged,” Vex says, careful but firm, loud enough for the speaker to catch. “You have an incident number?”

Tollen stammers, “It’s internal—he said no—”

On the speaker, the voice sharpens. “Vex. He’s not a witness, he’s a problem. Move him.”

From behind the painted grille seam down the service chase, there’s a faint metallic rasp—someone shifting deeper toward the pump yard route you breathed. The building hum seems louder in the silence that follows, and outside, the buoy bell’s off-beat toll slips through the concrete like a heartbeat that won’t match yours.

**Status updates:**
- Courier identified: Eli Tollen #3170  
- Speaker call: Rook’s office line

### Turn 140 [PLAYER]

I keep my hands up but don’t yield the doorway. “On speaker: state your name and position for the record,” I say to the voice, calm and cold. Then I look at Vex. “You move me without an order number and you’re doing their dirty work—log it as an attempted unlawful detention and an unauthorized access request by Eli Tollen, badge 3170.”

*Agent reasoning: Rook’s office is trying to strong-arm Vex into moving me; I need to lock them into the record, keep Vex on my side, and buy time for whoever’s in the vent to clear to the pump yard.*

### Turn 141 [GAME]

The speaker line goes quiet for half a breath—just the hiss of static and the faint click of a relay—like whoever’s on the other end didn’t expect you to demand *their* name on record.

Then the woman answers, voice tightening. “Deputy Commissioner Sable Kint. Harbor Authority Oversight.” She doesn’t sound like Rook’s secretary; she sounds like the person his secretary is afraid of. “This call is not consent to record, Calder. Step away from the Compliance threshold.”

Vex’s jaw works. He looks up at the camera dome, then at Marr, then back to you. Your wording lands: *order number* and *log it*. Vex doesn’t grab you. Instead he shifts his stance so he’s between you and Tollen, palm out toward the courier like a stop sign.

“Copy,” Vex says, loud enough for the speaker and the camera. “Marr—note: unauthorized access request by Eli Tollen, badge three-one-seven-zero. No incident number provided. Calder nonviolent, hands visible.” It’s not the heroic speech, but it’s a paper trail with teeth.

Marr’s eyes flick—quick, nervous—to the phone, then the corridor log terminal mounted under it. He starts keying with two fingers, clumsy in wet gloves. The keys click loud in the narrow hall, mixing with the buzz of the docklight outside the service door to the west.

Tollen’s face goes slick with sweat. “They said—Kint said—” He tries to edge the satchel forward anyway, testing whether Vex will let him pass. Vex plants a boot and blocks him without touching you.

On speaker, Kint’s tone turns flat. “Vex. You are being instructed. If Calder remains, he is interfering with an active safety sweep.” A pause, then: “I can have your badge frozen before morning.”

From behind the painted grille seam deeper in the service chase, there’s another faint rasp—then a soft *thunk*, like someone’s elbow bumping a duct brace as they commit to the pump-yard route. The fog outside presses against the corridor windows, turning the harbor into a blank page—good for cover, bad for witnesses.

### Turn 142 [PLAYER]

I keep my hands visible and my shoulder against the doorframe, not budging. “Deputy Commissioner Kint—acknowledged. State the incident number and the specific hazard you’re claiming, for Marr’s log,” I say into the speaker, steady.  
Then I look at Vex, quieter. “You don’t touch me. If she wants my badge, she can file it—let her own it on paper.”  
I glance at Tollen’s satchel. “Eli Tollen, you take one more step and I’m calling it forced entry on camera.”

*Agent reasoning: Kint’s trying to bully Vex into moving me; if I stay calm and keep the record clean, I can protect Vex and stall long enough for whoever’s in the vent to clear the pump yard. I also need to probe what “safety sweep” really means without giving them an excuse to grab me.*

### Turn 143 [GAME]

Kint doesn’t give you the incident number. That’s the immediate win: on speaker, in front of Vex and Marr and the camera, she refuses to anchor her order to anything verifiable.

A thin exhale hisses through the phone grill, then her voice comes back colder. “Hazard: compromised evidence chain and unauthorized presence in Compliance during a sweep. Incident numbers are internal until secured.” She’s trying to make *procedure* the weapon—keep it vague, keep it moving.

Marr keeps typing at the log terminal under the wall phone, the wet keys clicking. He reads as he enters it, for the record: “Caller identifies as Deputy Commissioner Sable Kint, Oversight. Declines to provide incident number. Claims hazard: compromised evidence chain, unauthorized presence.” His eyes flick up to the camera dome as if to make sure it heard him too.

You lean into the doorframe. The metal is cold through your jacket shoulder; the corridor smells like damp paper and disinfectant, with fog seeping in every time the outer service door shifts on its hinges.

Vex stays true to what you asked—he doesn’t put hands on you. But he does slide half a step closer, low-voiced: “Rafe… they freeze my badge, they’ll put me on a pier post with no radio and call it ‘safety.’” It’s a warning and a confession: he’s scared, and he’s not fully theirs.

Tollen flinches at “forced entry on camera.” He stops advancing, but his grip tightens on the satchel and his eyes dart to Vex like he’s silently begging for permission to push anyway. A bead of water runs off the satchel seam—either fog condensation, or it’s been outside recently.

On the speaker, Kint’s patience thins. “Vex. Final instruction. Clear Calder from the threshold and escort courier Tollen inside.” Then, quieter but still audible: “If you refuse, I’ll assume you’re part of the contamination.”

Behind the painted grille seam in the service chase, there’s a soft, deliberate scrape—someone repositioning near the junction below the ladder. Not leaving yet. Listening.

**Status updates**
- Kint: refuses incident number  
- Marr: logs refusal + hazard claim

### Turn 144 [PLAYER]

I keep my shoulder in the frame and look right at Vex. “Then don’t refuse—stall. Ask her, on speaker, if she’s ordering you to bypass incident-number protocol. Make her say it.”

I lean toward the phone. “Deputy Commissioner Kint, for the log: are you ordering Officer Vex to physically remove me and authorize entry into Compliance without an incident number, yes or no?”

Without taking my eyes off Tollen, I add, low and sharp, “Marr—keep that log running. Tollen, set the satchel down and step back. Now.”

*Agent reasoning: Kint’s pushing Vex to act without a number; I need to give Vex a way to refuse without losing face, keep the camera-record clean, and buy time for whoever’s in the service chase to get clear.*

### Turn 145 [GAME]

Vex takes your stall and runs with it. He squares up so the camera dome catches his face and the phone on speaker catches his voice. “Deputy Commissioner—confirming for corridor log: you are ordering physical removal of Rafael Calder and authorizing courier entry to Compliance without an incident number. Yes or no.”

On the line, Kint hesitates—just long enough for Marr’s keyboard to clatter loud in the narrow hall. Then she answers, controlled but edged: “Yes. Under Oversight authority. Proceed.”

That “yes” lands like a stamp. Marr’s eyes go wide as he types it verbatim, swallowing hard. The corridor smells of wet wool and old paper; your shoulder against the doorframe feels the vibration of the building’s ventilation—steady, industrial—while the fog presses against the small window panes to the east.

Tollen reacts to your command faster than to Kint’s. He lowers the satchel—slow, careful—sets it on the damp concrete between his shoes, and takes one step back. His hands come up, palms out, like he’s trying to prove he’s not the one pushing. “I’m not— I’m just delivering,” he says, voice thin. The Harbor seal sticker on the satchel is torn enough to show a second mark underneath: a Tideglass-style wave sigil, half-scraped away.

Vex doesn’t touch you yet. He leans in, low and urgent, so only you hear: “That’s her owning it. If I move you now, it’s clean for them.” His gaze flicks to the satchel, then to the painted grille seam down the service chase. “And someone’s listening.”

From behind that seam: a faint shift, then stillness—whoever’s in the chase holds position, waiting to see if the doorway clears.

On speaker, Kint adds, quieter, meant to sound procedural: “Marr, ensure the log is exported to Oversight. Immediately.”

**Status updates**

### Turn 146 [PLAYER]

I lift my chin toward the camera dome. “Heard and logged, Deputy Commissioner Kint. Marr—export to *local* archive too, time-stamped.”  

I lean closer to Vex, voice tight. “Don’t put hands on me. You ‘attempt,’ I ‘comply’ slow—make it ugly on record.”  

Then I point at the satchel without stepping off the threshold. “Tollen, back up another two steps and keep your hands where I can see them. Vex—look at that mark. Tideglass doesn’t ride Harbor seals unless someone’s laundering a chain.”  

Without turning my head, I murmur toward the painted grille seam, barely audible: “Pump yard. Keep going. Don’t come back for me.”

*Agent reasoning: Kint just put her name on an unlawful-looking order; I need to protect Vex, keep the doorway blocked, and get eyes on that Tideglass mark without letting anyone rush Compliance. Also, the listener in the chase means this is bigger—signal them to keep moving while we hold the line.*

### Turn 147 [GAME]

Marr hears you say “local archive” and goes pale—then does it anyway. He doesn’t argue; he just nods once and stabs at the terminal. The export progress bar crawls, and the printer beside the wall phone whines as it spits a thin receipt strip with a timestamp and a file hash. He rips it off with shaking fingers and tucks it under the keyboard like he’s hiding contraband in plain sight.

On speaker, Kint’s voice tightens. “Marr—do *not*—” She stops herself mid-sentence, then switches to threat-dressed-as-policy. “Unauthorized duplication of Oversight logs is a terminable offense.”

Vex doesn’t touch you. He shifts his weight like he’s bracing to *perform* an escort without actually escalating it—one hand hovering near his belt, open, visible for the camera. “I’m attempting verbal compliance,” he says, loud enough for the dome mic. Then, quieter to you: “Slow is good. Slow gives you witnesses.”

Tollen backs up the two steps you demanded, boots squeaking on damp concrete. His hands stay up, trembling. The satchel remains on the floor between you and him like a live thing. When Vex leans to get a better look, the torn Harbor seal shows that half-scraped wave sigil more clearly—Tideglass styling, the kind printed on memorial programs and “charity” receipts. Vex’s eyes flick to you: confirmation, and fear.

From the painted grille seam down the service chase, there’s a soft, answering scrape—whoever’s back there takes your “pump yard” and moves. The sound retreats along the right branch outlet, careful, controlled. Not gone fast—gone smart.

The corridor itself feels tighter now: to the west, the outer service door shudders as wind pushes fog through its weatherstrip; overhead, the fluorescent hum seems louder, like the building is listening too. Somewhere farther out, a radio squawks once—cut off mid-code.

Kint comes back on, colder. “Officer Vex. Secure the satchel and clear the obstruction. If Calder delays, document resistance.” She’s steering the narrative, trying to make your slowness the crime.

**Status updates**
- Marr: local export + receipt printed

### Turn 148 [PLAYER]



### Turn 149 [GAME]

Vex nods once—tiny, almost imperceptible—then steps half in front of you without touching you, making his body the “escort” the camera can read. “Calder, you’re obstructing. I’m directing you to step back from the threshold,” he says for the record, voice steady but his eyes apologizing. His open palm hovers near your shoulder—close enough to look like control, not close enough to be contact.

Marr keeps the log running. He slides the fresh receipt strip out from under the keyboard and palms it into his sleeve with a practiced motion that says he’s done this kind of quiet theft before. The terminal chimes: **EXPORT COMPLETE**—twice. One to Oversight. One to local archive.

Tollen doesn’t move toward the satchel. He keeps his hands up and swallows hard. “I don’t know about Tideglass,” he insists, too fast. “I was told the seal was… pre-cleared.” His gaze keeps darting to the satchel like he expects it to bite.

On speaker, Kint hears the export chime through the mic and goes razor-flat. “Marr. Identify the local endpoint you used.” A pause. “Now.”

The air in the corridor is damp and metallic; to the west the service door leaks fog in slow breaths, and the concrete under the satchel darkens with moisture. The satchel’s torn Harbor seal curls at the edges, exposing that half-scraped Tideglass wave—deliberate, not accidental.

Vex crouches just enough to *look* at the mark without “securing” anything yet. Quietly, only for you: “If I pick it up, chain’s theirs. If you pick it up, they call it tampering.” Then louder, for the dome: “Satchel observed on floor. Seal appears compromised.”

From somewhere deeper in the building, a door closes—heavy, Compliance-weight—followed by the faint roll of a cart. Someone inside is moving assets while Kint keeps you pinned in the hallway.

**Status updates**
- Log export: Oversight + local

### Turn 150 [PLAYER]

I ease back one slow step like I’m complying, hands still up. “Directive acknowledged, Vex—I’m stepping off the threshold.”

I lean toward the speaker. “Deputy Commissioner Kint, the local endpoint is *my instruction* for preservation against ‘accidental’ loss—log it as mine. Marr, do not answer her endpoint question on an open mic.”

I nod at the satchel. “Vex: tape the perimeter and call it a compromised package—no one touches it until a neutral evidence tech photographs and re-bags it in-frame. Tollen, you stay right there and keep your hands up.”

*Agent reasoning: Kint is trying to identify and punish Marr for the local archive; I need to shield him and keep the satchel from being “secured” into their chain. I’ll comply just enough to defuse Vex’s obstruction script while forcing a neutral evidence hold and buying time.*

### Turn 151 [GAME]

You ease back that single, deliberate step. Vex immediately mirrors it—keeping himself between you and the satchel—so the dome camera records a clean narrative: you complied, he maintained control without contact.

Kint hears you claim ownership of the local preservation and pounces. “Logged as yours,” she says, voice like a blade on stone. “Which makes you responsible for any contamination. Officer Vex—note that.” She’s trying to turn your safeguard into a liability.

Marr doesn’t answer her endpoint question. He swallows, keeps his hands off the mic, and types instead—adding a line to the corridor log: **LOCAL ARCHIVE EXPORT PER CALDER — PRESERVATION**. His eyes flick to you: gratitude and fear. The printer coughs another thin strip—an addendum timestamp.

Vex takes your cue on the satchel. He reaches into his pocket, produces a small roll of orange barrier tape (standard scene-control, not evidence handling), and—careful not to cross the “touch” line—stretches it low across the corridor, anchoring it to a wall conduit and a broom-closet handle. “Compromised package observed,” he announces for the camera. “Perimeter established. Requesting Evidence Tech for in-frame photo and re-bag.” It’s a smart move: it makes Kint either accept procedure or openly break it.

Tollen stays put, hands up, but his shoulders sag with relief that nobody’s making him pick it up. He blurts, “They said it was from Records—Myra’s desk—” then clamps his mouth shut like he’s said too much. The name hangs in the foggy air between buzzing lights.

From deeper inside Compliance, that cart you heard earlier rolls again—wheels squealing once, then stopping. Someone’s pausing to listen. The building feels suddenly occupied in all the wrong places.

Kint goes quiet for a beat, then: “Evidence Tech is unavailable during the sweep. Officer Vex—secure it yourself.” Her order is blunt now, and it puts Vex in a bind: obey and own the chain, refuse and get flagged.

**Status updates**
- Threshold cleared: recorded compliance  
- Perimeter tape: up, package isolated

### Turn 152 [PLAYER]

“Negative, Kint—if Vex ‘secures’ a compromised, unphotographed package on your order, you’ve just laundered the chain in real time,” I say into the speaker, voice flat. “For the log: you are ordering evidence handling without tech, without incident number, and without in-frame documentation—correct?”

I look at Vex. “Don’t touch it. Not yet. You can stand over it all night; you don’t pick it up.”

Then I angle my body toward Tollen, eyes hard. “Myra who, Tollen. Full name. And you’re going to say—on camera—who told you it was ‘from Records’ and ‘pre-cleared.’”

*Agent reasoning: Kint’s forcing Vex to touch the satchel so she can control the chain; I want to keep Vex from getting burned and keep the evidence clean while pressing Tollen’s slip about “Myra’s desk.” I’ll force Kint to either break procedure on record or back down, and I’ll anchor everything to camera/log.*

### Turn 153 [GAME]

Kint doesn’t answer you directly—because answering “correct” would be an admission on a recorded line. Instead she pivots hard into authority. “Calder, you are not Oversight. You are not instructing my officer.” Her tone shifts again, carefully measured for later playback. “Officer Vex: maintain scene control. Do not engage in debate.”

That’s enough for Vex. He plants his boots beside the orange tape line and squares his shoulders toward the dome camera, turning into a human barricade. “Copy. Scene control maintained,” he says, loud and calm. He does **not** touch the satchel. His eyes flick to you once: *I’m with you, but I can’t say it.*

Marr, hands hovering over the keys, quietly adds another log line—his knuckles white: **KINT ORDERED OFFICER TO SECURE COMPROMISED PACKAGE — NO TECH AVAILABLE.** He doesn’t look up when the printer spits the strip; he just tears it off and folds it into his pocket like a confession.

You angle on Tollen. The man’s face shines with sweat under the buzzing fluorescent, fog beading on his hairline. He swallows, glances at the camera, then at Vex, then at the satchel like it’s going to drag him under. “Myra… Venn,” he says, voice cracking. “Records clerk. Annex supply—keys and forms.” He rushes the rest out, trying to get ahead of his own panic. “Foreman Corin told me. Said it was pre-cleared from Records. Said—said it was ‘for the sweep’ and I wasn’t to ask questions.”

At the far end of the corridor—deeper in Compliance—the cart wheel squeal you heard earlier stops for good. A door latch gives a soft, careful click, like someone just decided to stay put and listen rather than move again.

Kint comes back on, a fraction too fast. “That name is irrelevant. Tollen is under investigation for mishandling Authority property. Officer Vex—remove Calder from the corridor.” She can’t win the evidence fight cleanly, so she tries to move you out of frame.

The fog keeps breathing through the west service door seam; the damp patch under the satchel widens by a finger’s width, and the torn seal curls another millimeter—paper fibers drinking saltwater.

**Status updates**
- Vex: holds line, no touch

### Turn 154 [PLAYER]

I take two slow steps back—hands open, calm—staying in the dome’s view. “I’m not resisting removal, Vex. I’m complying and I’m staying on camera.”

I raise my voice just enough to carry. “For the log: Tollen states Records clerk **Myra Venn** and Foreman **Corin** instructed ‘pre-cleared’ delivery for the sweep. Marr—read that back into the record.”

Then, quieter to Vex, eyes on the taped line: “Keep your boots there. If she wants me gone, fine—but you don’t touch that satchel without photos.”

*Agent reasoning: Kint wants me out of frame so they can move the satchel and scrub the chain; I need to stay visible without giving her “resistance,” and get names locked into the log while nudging Vex to keep the perimeter.*

### Turn 155 [GAME]

Vex escorts you back with nothing more than his body angle and a flat hand held out—no grab, no shove—so the dome records clean compliance. You stay in-frame the whole time, two slow steps, palms open.

Marr clears his throat and does exactly what you asked. He leans toward the mic, voice tight but audible: “For the corridor log: Subject Tollen states Records clerk **Myra Venn** and Foreman **Corin** instructed a ‘pre-cleared’ delivery ‘for the sweep.’ Statement made on camera. Timestamp appended.” The terminal prints the read-back line; the paper’s still warm when he tears it free.

On speaker, Kint goes cold-silent for a beat—then you hear the faint click of her muting and unmuting, like she’s deciding what she can afford to say on record. “Noted,” she finally says. “Officer Vex, continue removal. Officer Marr, lock the terminal.”

The corridor smells like wet concrete and ozone from the buzzing light strip overhead. To the west, fog presses through the service-door seam in slow pulses, and the orange tape trembles slightly with the building’s ventilation.

Vex keeps his boots planted at the tape line like you told him, eyes forward. Quiet, without moving his lips much: “I’m not touching it. But she’ll send someone who will.” His gaze flicks past you—down the hall toward the Compliance interior.

Because right then, the heavy Compliance door deeper in gives a soft hydraulic sigh and opens a crack. A woman in a Harbor rain shell—hood up, badge chain tucked, nitrile gloves already on—peers out. Not Evidence Tech. Internal. The kind that “handles” things. She clocks the satchel, the tape, Vex’s stance, and you still on camera.

Tollen sees her and shrinks against the wall, hands still up. “That’s… that’s not—” he starts, then swallows it. He looks at you like he wants permission to run and knows he can’t.

Kint’s voice returns, sharpened: “Officer Vex, you have an officer inbound to secure Authority property. Maintain control of Calder.”

**Status updates**

- Tollen statement: read back, logged

### Turn 156 [PLAYER]

I keep my hands open and raise my voice to the dome. “Unknown internal officer approaching compromised package—gloves on, no evidence tech present. Vex, state for the record you did *not* authorize handling and the perimeter was established.”

I angle my head toward Marr without taking my eyes off the handler. “Marr—do not lock yourself out; print the incident stub, time, and hash again and keep the local export live.”

Then I look straight at the woman in the rain shell. “Stop at the tape. Identify yourself—name and badge number—on camera. If you touch that satchel before in-frame photos, you’re breaking chain and you know it.”

*Agent reasoning: Kint’s sending an internal fixer to contaminate or disappear the satchel; I can’t stop her physically, but I can force documentation and make Vex hold procedure. I also need Marr to preserve the local copy and get Tollen talking before he folds.*

### Turn 158 [PLAYER]

I snap my eyes to the dome and the speaker. “Kint—did you just cut the camera or the audio? Answer for the record.”  

I keep my hands open and take a half-step to keep the tape, Vex, and the handler in my sightline. “You—rain shell—stop at the tape and state your name and badge number out loud. Vex, say on record you didn’t authorize anyone to cross that perimeter.”

*Agent reasoning: The feed went blank—either the dome or the line got cut—so I need to force verbal identification and keep a record through whoever’s still hearing, while not giving them an excuse to drag me out of view.*

### Turn 159 [GAME]

The dome camera’s red status LED blinks once… then goes dark.

Kint answers too fast, voice suddenly tinny like it’s been routed off the corridor feed. “Camera is down for maintenance. Continue to comply, Calder.” She doesn’t say *audio*. She doesn’t say *I ordered it*. But the timing is a confession all the same.

Vex snaps his chin up toward the dome out of reflex, then back to the tape. He raises his voice anyway—because even if the dome is dead, Marr’s terminal mic might still be hot. “For record: I did not authorize any crossing of this perimeter,” he says, steady. His boots don’t move.

The woman in the rain shell stops exactly at the tape—close enough that the fog-slick orange plastic kisses her shins when the ventilation breathes. She doesn’t give you name and badge. She gives you procedure, like a shield. “Authority Internal Compliance,” she says. “You don’t need my number to comply.” Her gloved hand lifts—not to the satchel yet, but to a small black device clipped inside her sleeve. A portable signal jammer, the kind that makes cameras “go down for maintenance.”

Marr’s fingers hover over the keyboard. He doesn’t lock the terminal. Instead he hits print again—fast, guilty—and the printer chatters out a fresh incident stub with timestamp and system hash. He palms it and slides it under the keyboard mat like he’s hiding a knife. Quiet, without looking up: “Export’s still live… for now.”

Behind the Internal officer, down the hall, the hydraulic door that cracked earlier eases open wider—someone else is watching from inside Compliance, staying out of the fogged corridor light.

The damp patch under the satchel has spread enough that the paper tag on it is starting to curl at the corner; the salt smell is stronger, sharp as a cut.

**Status updates**
- Dome camera: cut (LED dark)
- Vex: perimeter refusal stated

### Turn 160 [PLAYER]

I pull my phone and start recording, holding it up so Vex and the tape line are in frame. “Since you took the dome down, I’m making my own record—state your name and badge number again, Internal.”

I angle my voice toward the speaker. “Kint, you’re ordering an off-camera evidence seizure with a jammer present. If that satchel moves without photos, I’m filing obstruction and chain tampering.”

Without looking away from the woman, I call to Marr: “Marr—print one more stub, then kill the export to a physical drive and pocket it. Tollen—say it again: Myra Venn, Foreman Corin, pre-cleared for the sweep.”

Then, to Vex, low and urgent: “If she crosses that tape, you stop her with your body—no hands on the bag—just block. If she wants through, she says her name first.”

*Agent reasoning: They killed the camera and brought a jammer—this is a quiet evidence snatch. I can’t out-muscle it without getting arrested, but I can force names, create alternate recording, and get Marr/Vex to anchor the chain while I call in an external witness.*

### Turn 161 [GAME]

Your phone camera catches the whole tableau: Vex planted at the tape, the satchel sweating salt into the concrete, and the rain-shell woman’s gloved hand hovering like she’s deciding which rule matters more.

Immediate outcome: she doesn’t give you a badge number—but your recording forces her to change tactics. She lowers her voice and says, carefully, “You’re interfering with an internal secure item. Put the phone away and you won’t get hurt in the sweep.” Not a threat she can deny later, but close enough to taste.

On the speaker, Kint’s tone turns legal-smooth. “Calder, you are not authorized to record within a secured Authority corridor. Power down the device.” She still doesn’t deny the jammer; she talks around it.

Marr prints again—one more stub with fresh timestamp and hash. The printer’s heat smell cuts through the fog. Then he reaches into his desk drawer and yanks out a small gray thumb drive with a Harbor Authority asset sticker half-scraped off. You hear the USB click as he kills the live export and shunts it local. He doesn’t pocket it yet—he slides it into his shirt pocket and flattens his palm over it like it might jump out.

Tollen’s throat works. He glances at the rain-shell woman, then at Vex, then at you. He forces it out, louder this time, like he’s trying to nail it into the air: “Myra Venn. Foreman Corin. Pre-cleared for the sweep.” His voice cracks on “sweep.”

Vex follows your low instruction without looking at you. He shifts half a step—pure body geometry—so the only way past the tape is through his chest. “Name and badge,” he says to the woman, flat. “You don’t cross without it.”

The rain-shell woman’s eyes flick to the satchel. Then to the Compliance doorway behind her—where the watcher retreats a fraction, staying just out of corridor light. She taps her sleeve device once. Your phone’s screen jitters—static bands crawl across the image—but it keeps recording audio clean. The jammer’s strong, not perfect.

The salt-stink spikes as the satchel’s tag corner peels further, exposing tacky ink beneath—fresh, like it was stamped minutes ago.

### Turn 162 [PLAYER]

I keep the phone up, voice steady. “Say that again—‘won’t get hurt in the sweep’—and give your name and badge for my recording.”

I glance at Marr. “Pocket the drive and walk—now. Tollen, with him. Get out of this corridor and don’t talk to anyone but Oversight.”

Low to Vex, tight: “Hold the line, but don’t get yourself broken for me—if she pushes, we fall back and we keep filming.”

*Agent reasoning: She just implied a threat and they killed the official camera—my only leverage is making this ugly on record and keeping Vex from getting sacrificed. I need her ID, and I need Marr and Tollen moved out before “the sweep” turns into a cleanup.*

### Turn 163 [GAME]

The rain-shell woman’s jaw tightens when you repeat her words back at her. For half a second she looks like she might actually do it—say it again, put a name to it—then her eyes flick to the phone and she pivots.

**Immediate outcome:** she doesn’t give you a name or badge. Instead she reaches into her inner sleeve and snaps the jammer to a higher setting. Your phone’s video tears into rolling gray, then freezes on a single frame of Vex at the tape. Audio still catches a few syllables—then drops into a watery, distant hiss. You’re still holding a record, but it’s getting strangled.

Kint comes over the speaker, closer now, like she’s moved to a nearer console. “Calder. Last warning. Power down recording and step back from the secured item.” There’s a second voice under hers—male, low—too garbled to identify, but close enough to suggest she’s not alone on that line.

Marr pockets the drive hard, like he’s afraid it’ll be seen through his shirt. He nods once at you—thank you or goodbye—and starts walking fast down the corridor away from Compliance, pulling Tollen with him by the elbow. Tollen’s eyes are wide; he keeps repeating under his breath, “Oversight. Oversight,” like it’s a prayer that makes him real.

Vex holds exactly where you told him to—no hands, just body. But the rain-shell woman closes the distance to the tape with a deliberate step and says, quietly, so only you and Vex can hear: “You want a name? Ask Harrow who she sent.” Then, louder, to Vex: “Move.”

Behind her, the Compliance door opens another inch. A shoulder and a badge edge appear, then stop—someone ready to surge if Vex doesn’t.

The corridor air tastes like hot plastic and salt. The satchel’s tag peels further, ink tacky enough to shine; the damp beneath it has started to creep toward the tape line.

### Turn 164 [PLAYER]

I lower my phone slowly, thumb hovering like I’m powering it down, and take one step back from the tape. “Fine. I’m stepping back—no sudden moves.”

Eyes on the rain-shell woman: “Harrow sent you. That’s what you want on whatever record survives.” Then to Vex, low: “Fall back with me—don’t let them turn this into an assault charge.”

I angle my voice down the hall after Marr and Tollen: “Keep walking. Don’t stop. Oversight—now.”

*Agent reasoning: The jammer’s killing my record and they’re about to force the line; my priority is keeping Marr/Tollen moving with the drive while not getting Vex crushed. I’ll de-escalate just enough to avoid a violent takedown, but I’ll plant the “Harrow” tell and keep eyes on the satchel’s leak for later.*

### Turn 165 [GAME]

You lower the phone like you’re obeying and take that single step back from the tape.

**Immediate outcome:** the pressure in the corridor eases by a hair—enough that nobody can claim you “advanced” or “lunged.” Vex mirrors you immediately, retreating the same distance, hands open at his sides. The rain-shell woman clocks the de-escalation and uses it: she steps up to the tape line and, with two fingers, hooks the sagging strip so it lifts without snapping. She doesn’t cross with her boots—she doesn’t need to. She reaches *under* the tape and drags the satchel toward her in a smooth pull, keeping her body technically on the “clean” side.

Fog beads on the satchel’s canvas; the wet patch it leaves behind is darker than water—briny, with a faint oily sheen that catches the corridor light. The curled accident tag finally peels enough to show the stamped time: it’s ahead of the current minute, the ink still tacky like it was printed seconds ago.

You put it into the air—“Harrow sent you”—and she answers with a look that’s almost satisfied. “Good,” she says, quiet. “Now it has a name in your mouth instead of mine.” She tucks the satchel against her hip like it’s evidence and turns her shoulder toward the Compliance door.

On the speaker, Kint doesn’t correct you. That silence is its own admission. “Calder,” she says, measured, “step back to the wall. Remain available for statement.” The male undertone on the line breathes once—close, impatient.

Down the hall, Marr and Tollen keep moving. You hear Marr hiss, “Don’t look back,” and Tollen’s shoes scuff faster. They round the corner and vanish into the fogged service light, the drive now out of immediate reach.

The second body at the Compliance door finally commits: a broad-shouldered Authority officer in a black rain cape, badge half-hidden, slides into view just enough to bracket the rain-shell woman—escort, not backup. His eyes never leave Vex.

**Environmental pressure:** the jammer’s still chewing the air; your phone stays unstable. And with the satchel moving, whatever was “secured” is about to disappear into Compliance where paperwork becomes reality.

**Status updates**
- Tape line: no breach (boots)

### Turn 166 [PLAYER]

I step back to the wall like Kint ordered, palms open, eyes never leaving the satchel. “For the statement: Internal seized the package without in-frame photos; tag time was ahead of current minute; residue is brine with oily sheen—log that.”

I nod once to Vex, low. “Wall. Breathe. Let it go.”

As the rain-shell woman turns, I crouch by the dark wet patch the satchel left behind and swipe the edge of my sleeve/handkerchief through it—just enough to take a sample—then I hold it up at chest height. “You’re walking that into Compliance—what room? What locker? Say it out loud so it exists somewhere besides your paperwork.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re trying to vanish the satchel into Compliance; I can’t stop them without getting Vex and me folded up. But that “future” timestamp and briny slick are wrong—supernatural or a setup—so I need a trace: the residue, the moment, and where it goes. I’ll comply outwardly, keep Vex safe, and grab a physical sample/visual anchor before it’s cleaned.*

### Turn 167 [GAME]

You flatten to the wall on Kint’s order, palms open, and speak your “statement” into the dead space of the corridor like you’re making it part of the building. Vex follows—back to the wall, a slow exhale through his nose, shoulders loosening a fraction. The broad-shouldered officer’s posture eases just enough to signal *no excuse to grab you*.

Then you crouch at the tape line and drag your sleeve/handkerchief edge through the dark wet patch.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** you get a sample—thick, cold, and wrong. It isn’t just seawater; it smears like diluted machine oil, and the salt bite hits the back of your throat immediately. As you stand, the rain-shell woman’s gaze snaps to your hand. That’s the first time she looks genuinely annoyed.

The corridor light to your left buzzes, stuttering against the fog press at the far end; the wet patch glistens on the concrete like a bruise, right where the satchel scraped.

“Say it out loud,” you press. “Room. Locker.”

She adjusts the satchel higher on her hip and keeps moving toward the Compliance door, but she answers—half a concession, half a knife. “Compliance intake,” she says, loud enough for Kint’s line to catch if it’s recording. “Evidence transfer. Locker **C-17**.” She pauses at the threshold and adds, softer, “It’ll be logged as *found property* unless you stop making this a scene.”

The broad-shouldered officer steps between you and the doorway, blocking sight of the satchel for a beat while the rain-shell woman slips inside. His voice is flat. “Wall means wall, Calder. Don’t follow.”

On the speaker, Kint’s silence breaks into a clipped inhale. “I heard that,” she says—about the locker, or about your statement, you can’t tell. “Remain where you are.”

Down the hall, distant and muffled, a door buzzes open—Marr and Tollen finding their way out, or someone intercepting them. The jammer’s pressure eases slightly as the rain-shell woman passes through the Compliance threshold; your phone screen flickers back from frozen gray to a shaky image.

### Turn 168 [PLAYER]

I hold my smeared sleeve away from my body like it’s radioactive and tell Vex low, “Don’t touch this—just watch my back.” Then I raise my voice to the speaker: “Kint, confirm you heard ‘Evidence transfer, locker C-17’—say it back for the record.”  

I pull my phone closer to my chest and start recording again, panning to the wet patch and the peeled tag residue spot. “Time-stamped video: residue collected, locker stated as C-17.”  

Then, without moving off the wall, I call down the hall, sharp: “Marr! Tollen! If you’re stopped—say ‘Oversight’ and don’t surrender the drive.”

*Agent reasoning: I can’t chase into Compliance without getting boxed into a charge, but I can lock down what I heard, preserve the sample, and get eyes on Marr/Tollen before they’re intercepted. I also want to needle Kint into admitting the locker on-record.*

### Turn 169 [GAME]

Vex gives you a tight nod and shifts half a step so his shoulder blocks the broad-shouldered officer’s clean line to your hands. He doesn’t touch the smeared cloth—just watches, jaw working.

You raise your voice to the speaker. “Kint, confirm you heard—”

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Kint answers, and she does it the way a bureaucrat locks a door. “Confirmed,” she says, crisp. “Evidence transfer lockers. **C–one–seven.** Noted.” You hear a faint click on the line like she’s toggled something—recording, or routing, or both.

Your phone, now that the jammer’s farther away, catches clean enough: the wet patch shines under the buzzing strip light; the torn edge where the tag residue stuck to the floor shows a faint rectangle of tacky ink and grit. Your own voice stamps the moment onto the audio: “Time-stamped video…”

The broad-shouldered officer watches the phone and then the floor, recalculating. He doesn’t move on you—yet—but his hand slides to his radio mic. “Control,” he murmurs, “Calder’s filming spillage at corridor tape line.”

From inside Compliance, a muffled metal clack—locker doors or a cart. The rain-shell woman’s silhouette passes behind frosted glass for a heartbeat, then vanishes deeper in.

Down the hall, your shout carries into the fogged service corridor. For a second there’s nothing—then a distant voice, too far to be sure if it’s Marr or someone mimicking him, barks back: “—sight!” The rest is swallowed by the building and the off-beat buoy bell somewhere outside, counting wrong.

The air near the floor still tastes like salt and hot insulation. The wet patch is already starting to dull at the edges as it soaks into porous concrete—evidence that won’t stay sharp for long.

### Turn 170 [PLAYER]

I keep filming and narrate softly, “Wet patch fading at edges—absorbing fast,” then tear a small clean strip from my handkerchief and dab the darkest part once, sealing it in the fold without stepping off the wall.  

I look up at the officer, voice even. “I’m documenting spillage and chain-of-custody statements you already confirmed. I’m not approaching Compliance.”  

Low to Vex: “Text Harrow’s office and Oversight both—C-17, brine-oil residue, tag time in the future. And if someone tries to take my phone, you witness it—no heroics.”

*Agent reasoning: The wet patch is fading and the officer’s about to clamp down; I need a better sample and a time anchor, but I can’t give them an excuse to grab me. I’ll keep calm, collect minimally, and try to get Vex to quietly alert someone outside Oversight.*

### Turn 171 [GAME]

You keep the phone rolling, voice low and steady, and the camera catches what your eyes already know: the wet patch is **shrinking**, edges going matte as the concrete drinks it down.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the handkerchief tears clean. You dab the darkest center once—just once—without stepping off the wall, and the strip comes away heavy with that brine-oil slick. When you fold it shut, it sticks to itself slightly, like there’s more binder than water in it.

The broad-shouldered officer’s gaze drops to your hands, then up to your face. Your even tone lands. He doesn’t rush you. Instead he keys his mic again, quieter: “He’s staying put. He’s collecting from the floor.” A pause, listening. “Yes, I said floor.”

Vex, at your shoulder, pulls his phone out without flair—thumb moving fast, screen angled away from the officer. He murmurs, barely audible, “Harrow’s office number is routed through dispatch after midnight. Oversight’s a web form unless you have a direct.” Not a refusal—just a warning about friction. He starts anyway.

From the Compliance side, a faint rolling squeal—cart wheels—and then the muffled, clipped cadence of the rain-shell woman speaking to someone out of sight: “Intake first. Don’t log it under incident. Not yet.” The words are distorted by the door, but the intent is clear.

The corridor strip light above you buzzes and spits a brief blue flare; for a second your screen exposure blooms, then settles. The fog at the far end keeps swallowing sound—Marr and Tollen are still somewhere in that muffled distance, and the building keeps reassigning who “owns” a hallway every minute.

### Turn 172 [PLAYER]

I angle my phone toward the Compliance door and quietly narrate, “Audio: ‘Intake first. Don’t log it under incident. Not yet.’ Heard through Compliance door,” then I look up at the officer. “I’m remaining on the wall. No approach.”

To the speaker, steady: “Kint—connect me to Oversight duty now or provide a direct number. I’m not submitting a web form while evidence is being reclassified.”

Low to Vex: “If dispatch routes Harrow, tell them it’s Calder—locker C-17, ‘not yet’ incident log, residue sample in hand. Ask for Oversight duty officer name.”

*Agent reasoning: Compliance is trying to bury the incident; I need their “not yet” on record and a direct Oversight contact, but I can’t give the officer an excuse to seize my phone. I’ll keep calm, keep filming, and push Kint to route me to Oversight while Vex works contacts.*

### Turn 173 [GAME]

You angle the phone toward the Compliance door and narrate the muffled line for the mic. The audio catches it—thin, filtered through metal and gasket, but intelligible enough: *“Intake first. Don’t log it under incident. Not yet.”*

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the broad-shouldered officer stiffens at the word *log*. His eyes flick to the ceiling dome cam, then back to your phone. “You’re done recording,” he says, not shouting—worse, certain. He takes one step closer but doesn’t put hands on you yet, like he’s waiting for permission in his earpiece.

The corridor around you is still the same narrow throat of concrete and strip lights; to your left the fogged service end breathes cold air in pulses, carrying a faint diesel tang and that wrong sweet-salt note from the spill.

On the speaker, Kint answers you with a controlled edge. “Oversight doesn’t take direct calls from the floor at this hour,” she says. “I can route a message through dispatch. Give me a one-sentence summary.” A beat. “And Calder—stop antagonizing Compliance staff. You’re making this harder to protect.”

Behind the Compliance door, the cart wheels squeal again, closer to the inner side of the door, then stop—like someone’s parked it to block a sightline. A second voice, male and bored, murmurs something you can’t make out. Paper shuffles. A stamp hits once: *thunk*. Not the big accident stamp—smaller, administrative.

Vex types fast, then murmurs back to you, “Dispatch picked up. They’re asking for incident number.” He glances at your damp carbon copy like he knows that’s the trap. “I’m telling them: ‘No incident number. Evidence transfer locker C-17. Reclassification in progress. Deputy Kint on line.’” Then, lower: “And I asked for Oversight duty officer name.”

Your phone screen flickers once—signal wobble—then steadies. The officer’s radio crackles; you catch a fragment: “—Soot says hold—”

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Audio captured: “not yet” line

### Turn 174 [PLAYER]

I stop moving the phone and hold it flat against my chest, screen outward, palms open around it. “I’m not resisting and I’m staying on the wall—but you put hands on me or my property, you state your name and badge number first.”

Into the speaker, tight and clear: “One-sentence for dispatch: ‘Internal seized tagged package without photos; tag time was ahead of current minute; brine-oil residue present; evidence stated to be in Compliance locker C-17; Compliance said, quote, “Don’t log it under incident. Not yet.”’”

Low to Vex, without looking away from the officer: “If he takes it, you say out loud the time and that he seized my phone mid-recording—then keep dispatch on the line and get me the Oversight duty officer name.”

*Agent reasoning: If he grabs the phone, the recording dies and they’ll bury this. I’ll de-escalate physically but get the data out and force Kint to carry it on record; also I trust Vex to be my witness and messenger.*

### Turn 175 [GAME]

You pin the phone flat to your chest, screen outward, hands open around it—nonthreatening, but making it physically awkward for him to snatch without it looking like exactly what it is.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the officer hesitates. He’s close enough now you can smell his wet wool and cheap coffee, but he doesn’t grab you. “Officer Harlan,” he says, clipped, and taps the metal on his chest. “Badge **4-19**.” He says it like he’s been trained to say it only when forced—then his eyes flick to Vex and the speaker as if to confirm witnesses exist. He keeps his hands visible, but he’s planted himself between you and the Compliance door.

On speaker, Kint goes quiet through your one-sentence summary—quiet in a way that means it landed hard. When she speaks again, her tone is different: professional, colder. “Dispatch received. Stay where you are. Do not enter Compliance. Officer Harlan will maintain the line.” A beat. “Calder—repeat the locker number.” She wants it on the recording twice.

Behind the Compliance door, the cart shifts—rubber wheels squeak as it’s pulled back a few inches, like someone realized you’re listening. A latch clicks once, not opening—just tested. The smaller administrative stamp hits again: *thunk… thunk*, faster now, like someone trying to get ahead of a paper trail.

Vex does exactly what you asked. Without raising his voice, he says clearly, “Time is—” and reads it off his phone down to the minute, then adds, “Officer Harlan seized no property at this time; recording ongoing.” It’s a warning wrapped as documentation. Into his own call he says, “Need Oversight duty officer name. No incident number. Evidence locker C-17. Deputy Kint monitoring.”

The strip light above you buzzes; a thin line of condensation slides down the wall by your shoulder, cold against your sleeve. Somewhere deeper in the building, a door slams and echoes down the service chase—movement you can’t see, but it’s close enough to feel like pressure.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Officer ID obtained: Harlan 4-19  
- Dispatch message: transmitted via Kint  
- Compliance: stamping accelerating  
- Vex: Oversight name requested

### Turn 176 [PLAYER]

I keep my shoulders flat to the wall and say clearly to the speaker, “Locker number stated by Compliance: C-one-seven. Evidence transfer, C-17—repeat, C-17.”  

I tilt my head toward the Compliance door and call out, controlled but loud enough to carry, “Who’s stamping in there? Say your name for chain-of-custody.”  

Low to Vex: “If they won’t give a name, get the duty officer name and ask dispatch to time-stamp that Compliance refused identification while handling C-17.”

*Agent reasoning: Kint wants the locker number repeated for the record; Compliance is clearly trying to paper over this fast. I need to keep everything verbal and witnessed without escalating into a physical grab.*

### Turn 177 [GAME]

“C-one-seven. Evidence transfer, C-17—repeat, C-17.” Your words come out clean on the speaker, and Kint immediately echoes it back—deliberate, for the recording. “Copy: **C-17**.”

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** when you call out for chain-of-custody, the stamping stops mid-rhythm. Silence for half a second—then the Compliance door cracks open two inches against the security latch. A sliver of fluorescent light spills into the foggy corridor, cutting across Officer Harlan’s boots.

A man’s voice answers from the gap, irritated and careful. “Compliance Technician **Errol Dane**,” he says, like he’s reading it off a badge he doesn’t want you to see. “You are not authorized to address staff during an active intake.” The door doesn’t open further. You catch only fragments: a pale sleeve, a clipboard edge, and the corner of a rolling cart parked sideways inside—blocking the line to whatever lockers sit beyond.

Harlan shifts with the door, angling his body to keep you pinned in place without touching you. His hand hovers near his radio. “You got your name,” he mutters to you, low. “Don’t push for more.”

From inside, Dane adds something that matters: “Locker C-17 is **sealed pending supervisor sign-off**.” That’s either procedure—or a way to buy time to swap contents. The latch clicks again, tested, then the door closes to the latch with a soft thud.

To your right, Vex keeps dispatch on the line, voice steady. “Request time-stamp: Compliance identified as Errol Dane but refused full visual ID and continues handling C-17.” A pause as he listens. “Also requesting Oversight duty officer name.” He glances at you once, a quick confirmation: he’s doing exactly what you told him.

The corridor air tastes of old paper and brine; the strip light above you buzzes like a trapped fly. Somewhere deeper in the service chase—behind Compliance—footsteps move fast, then stop, like someone realized the hallway has ears.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Kint: C-17 confirmed on record  
- Compliance: “Errol Dane” named  
- C-17: “sealed pending sign-off”

### Turn 178 [PLAYER]

I keep my phone up and narrate, “Compliance Technician Errol Dane identified by voice; stated locker C-17 sealed pending supervisor sign-off,” then look at Harlan. “I’m not pushing past you—I’m documenting. You keep your hands off my phone and we’re fine.”

Into the speaker: “Kint—note for the record: I request Oversight duty respond in person to Compliance, corridor intake, immediately. Who is the supervisor signing for C-17—name and ETA?”

Low to Vex: “Ask dispatch for an actual body—Oversight or a lieutenant—sent here now. And text Marr/Tollen: ‘Hold position, don’t hand over drive, Compliance stalling on C-17.’”

*Agent reasoning: Dane giving a name is something, but “sealed pending sign-off” sounds like stalling to alter evidence; I can’t force entry, so I’ll lock in the paper trail, keep Harlan from escalating, and try to get Oversight physically en route while I hold position and keep recording.*

### Turn 179 [GAME]

You narrate it cleanly into your own mic—Dane’s name, the “sealed pending sign-off,” the fact it’s voice-only ID. Harlan’s jaw works once, but he doesn’t touch the phone. Whatever he heard in his earpiece earlier has changed; he’s watching the Compliance door now as much as he’s watching you.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Kint answers your push for Oversight in person with a tight exhale. “Noted for the record,” she says. “Oversight duty is **Lt. Marek Sorn**. I’m directing him to Compliance intake corridor now.” A beat, then the part she doesn’t like saying out loud: “Supervisor sign-off for evidence lockers is **Inspector Dain Rook**. ETA… unknown.” Her voice hardens. “Calder, stay put. Harlan, you do not seize Calder’s device unless I order it.”

That lands. Harlan’s eyes flick up—like he’s checking the nearest camera again—and he gives a short nod. “Heard,” he says into his radio, more to whoever’s listening than to you.

Vex, low and efficient, asks dispatch for “a body” and gets a real answer: dispatch confirms **Lt. Sorn en route** and logs the request as a corridor response, not an incident. Vex then thumbs out your text to Marr/Tollen exactly as phrased.

The corridor feels narrower now. To the east (deeper into Compliance), you hear a quick series of footsteps and the soft rattle of metal—like a locker bank being handled behind the door. Then a brief, wet squeak: the cart wheels again, repositioning.

Your eyes catch something you hadn’t clocked before: beside the Compliance door, the official placard sits slightly proud from the wall—one corner lifted as if it’s been pried and pressed back. In the strip light, the edge of an older plate shows beneath it, darker metal under newer paint.

From behind the door, Dane’s voice comes again, sharper. “No further statements. Intake is suspended pending supervisor.” He says it like a threat and a promise at the same time.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Oversight duty: Lt. Marek Sorn en route  
- Sign-off authority: Inspector Dain Rook named

### Turn 180 [PLAYER]

I keep my back on the wall and tilt my phone to zoom on the lifted placard edge, narrating softly, “Compliance door placard appears pried—older plate visible beneath newer signage; documenting in place, no approach.”  

I look at Harlan. “I’m not crossing your line. But if that sign’s been swapped, that’s chain-of-custody too—keep eyes on that door.”  

Into the speaker: “Kint, add: placard tampering observed beside Compliance intake door—possible signage swap. Request Lt. Sorn to photograph on arrival. And confirm: is Inspector Rook the same Rook assigned Harbor Evidence last quarter?”

*Agent reasoning: They’re buying time behind that door; the lifted placard is a quiet clue I can document without “approaching” Compliance. I want Oversight to see it before it disappears, and I don’t trust Rook’s “unknown ETA.”*

### Turn 181 [GAME]

You tilt the phone just enough to catch the lifted corner without stepping off the wall. The zoom hunts, then locks—your mic picking up your soft narration. On-screen, the newer placard’s screw head looks chewed, and beneath the paint you catch a darker, older plate with a different font edge—enough to show it’s not just loose, it’s been worked.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Harlan’s posture changes. He stops treating you like the problem and starts treating the door like one. He plants his feet square to the jamb and raises his radio. “Control, I want this door held—no one in or out until Oversight arrives.” It’s not a full order he can enforce alone, but it’s him putting his name on the line.

Kint answers on speaker, crisp. “Added to record: possible placard tampering. Lt. Sorn instructed to photograph on arrival.” At your question she doesn’t dodge. “Yes. Same Inspector **Dain Rook** assigned Harbor Evidence last quarter. Same badge series.” Then, quieter but still audible: “If Rook is the sign-off, he’s the choke point.”

The corridor light buzzes overhead; to the west the service corridor opens toward the building’s main hall, where distant voices and a rolling cart echo—normal operations pretending nothing’s wrong. Up close, the Compliance door seam shows a thin line of brighter light that flickers as someone moves inside.

From behind the door, you hear Dane again—closer now, like he’s standing right behind it. “Officer Harlan, you are obstructing an intake.” The words are formal, but his breathing isn’t. A metallic clink follows—like a latch tool or keyring being palmed.

Vex murmurs to you without turning his head: dispatch just updated—**Sorn is minutes out**, coming from Oversight, not Compliance. “Kint’s actually sending him,” Vex adds, like he’s surprised.

Somewhere deeper in the building a buoy-bell tone from outside bleeds faintly through a vent—off-tempo, wrong by a fraction, like it’s counting.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Placard tampering: documented on video  
- Harlan: holding door line  
- Kint: Rook confirmed, on record

### Turn 182 [PLAYER]

I keep recording and say toward the door, loud and even: “Dane—step back from the latch. No one’s obstructing intake; we’re preserving chain-of-custody until Oversight arrives.”

I look at Harlan. “He’s got a tool on that latch—if it opens, you call it in and keep him in sight. I’ll stay on the wall.”

Into the speaker: “Kint, I’m hearing metal on the latch—possible attempt to defeat the security catch. Request you direct Control to time-stamp: ‘No exit from Compliance intake until Lt. Sorn arrives.’ And ask Lt. Sorn to bring a camera and a witness.”

*Agent reasoning: Dane sounds like he’s about to force the latch or slip out before Oversight arrives; I can’t let them move evidence or rewrite the space. Harlan’s finally on the right side—back him up without escalating into a brawl, and keep everything on record until Sorn shows.*

### Turn 183 [GAME]

“Dane—step back from the latch.” Your voice carries down the intake corridor and hits the door like a hand on a chest.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** the metal sound stops—half a second of dead quiet—then the latch *clicks* as if someone eased pressure off it. Harlan immediately keys his radio. “Control, time-stamp: attempted latch manipulation heard at Compliance intake. Holding door. No exit until Oversight arrives.” He keeps his body square to the jamb, eyes fixed on the seam.

Kint comes back on speaker, brisk and authoritative. “Control is directed: time-stamp and log—**no exit from Compliance intake until Lt. Sorn arrives**.” You can hear her typing or someone else in the room moving paper. “Sorn is already bringing a camera. Witness: I’m assigning **Deputy Commissioner Sable Kint** as remote witness on open line; on-scene witness will be Sorn plus corridor officers.”

The air in the corridor tastes like old toner and salt. To the west, the main hall’s fluorescent wash flickers as a cart rolls past somewhere out of sight; to the east, the Compliance door’s lightline trembles—someone inside shifts their weight close enough that the hinge creaks.

Dane speaks through the door, clipped and angry now that he’s being recorded and boxed in. “There is no manipulation. Intake is suspended. I’m requesting supervisor.” His voice drops a fraction. “You’re making this worse.”

Vex, still on dispatch, murmurs without looking away from the door: “Sorn’s ETA just tightened. Two minutes.”

Then—under the door, near the threshold—something thin and pale slides into view for an instant, like a strip of paper being tested against the bottom gap, then yanked back. Not enough to identify, but enough to tell you someone inside is trying to move *something* without opening the door.

Outside the building, that off-beat buoy-bell tone leaks faintly through the vent again—wrong rhythm, wrong comfort.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Control: “no exit” time-stamped  
- Latch noise: stopped, logged  
- Lt. Sorn: ~2 minutes out  
- Compliance: attempted under-door pass observed

### Turn 184 [PLAYER]

I keep the camera trained low and narrate, “Possible under-door transfer attempt—thin paper-like item briefly visible at threshold, then retracted.” Then I look at Harlan. “Cover the bottom gap with your boot, don’t touch the door—just deny the pass.”

Into the speaker: “Kint, add: attempted under-door pass observed. Direct Control to log ‘no items removed from Compliance intake’ and have Lt. Sorn bring an evidence bag and gloves.” Low to Vex: “If anything comes out under there, don’t touch it—just keep it in frame and call the time.”

*Agent reasoning: Someone’s trying to slip something under the door; I can’t let evidence disappear, but I also can’t break the line and give them an excuse to pin this on me. I’ll document it, have Harlan secure the threshold, and keep Kint/Sorn keyed in while I listen for more movement.*

### Turn 185 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Your narration catches it on record—steady, clinical—and Harlan takes your cue without touching the door. He slides his boot forward to cover the bottom gap, heel planted, toe angled so anything pushed out will jam against leather instead of clearing into the corridor.

From inside, there’s an irritated scuff against the threshold—whoever was trying to feed something under meets resistance. A thin edge flashes once against the boot and vanishes back under the door.

Kint comes over the speaker immediately. “Added: attempted under-door pass observed. Control is directed to log: **no items removed from Compliance intake** until Oversight arrives.” You hear her voice shift as she addresses someone off-line. “Sorn will bring gloves and an evidence bag. Keep the line open.”

Dane’s voice snaps through the door, closer and more forced. “This is harassment. You’re impeding a safety function.” Then, a quieter aside you only catch because you’re recording: “Stop—don’t—” as if he’s talking to someone else in the room with him.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re still pinned to the wall opposite the Compliance intake door; the strip light above you buzzes, and the air tastes of salt and copier dust.

**MULTIPLE ACTIVE THREADS:**  
Vex keeps his hands visible and his stance neutral, but his eyes are locked on your phone screen, ready to call times. Down the main hall to the west, footsteps hurry—more than one set—approaching with the distinct cadence of someone moving with authority, not curiosity. And the pried placard beside the door catches the light again, the lifted corner trembling slightly with the movement inside.

A moment later, a different sound from within: paper being handled—fast, nervous—followed by a drawer slam or locker door thud.

Then the off-beat buoy-bell tone leaks faintly through the vent again, out of rhythm with the building’s hum.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Under-door pass: blocked, recorded  
- Control log: “no items removed”  
- Dane: not alone (overheard aside)

### Turn 186 [PLAYER]

I keep filming and say calmly toward the door, “Dane, you just told someone ‘stop—don’t.’ Identify who else is in there, now, for the record.”  

I glance toward the approaching footsteps and call out, “Oversight—corridor intake! We have attempted latch defeat and an under-door pass blocked; Compliance refusing visual ID.”  

Low to Vex: “When Sorn hits the corner, tell him to look at the placard first—pried corner—and keep his witness in frame with the door.”

*Agent reasoning: Oversight’s almost here; I need to keep the pressure on without escalating into a physical mess, and that buoy-bell wrongness is getting under my skin—stay anchored in procedure and the recording.*

### Turn 187 [GAME]

“Dane… identify who else is in there, now, for the record.”

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** For a beat, there’s only the buzz of the strip light and the thin whistle of airflow under the door. Then Dane answers—too quickly, like he’s choosing from a script. “No one else. You misheard.”

Your camera catches the lie in the room’s movement: the lightline at the door seam jitters twice, like two bodies shifting to avoid being seen. And from inside, a second voice—muffled, female, tight with urgency—cuts in for half a word before being smothered: “—Dain, don’t—”

Harlan’s jaw tightens. He keeps his boot sealing the bottom gap and raises his radio again. “Control, possible second party inside Compliance intake. Audio capture: second voice, female.”

You call down the hall and the approaching footsteps answer you: Lt. Marek Sorn rounds the corner hard, coat open, camera already up in one hand and an evidence bag kit in the other. Behind him is a uniformed corridor officer acting as witness, eyes wide, staying deliberately in frame when Sorn angles his lens.

Sorn doesn’t waste words. “Rafe, keep recording. Harlan, don’t touch the handle.” He steps to your side first—exactly as Vex relays—panning his camera over the **pried placard corner**, catching the tamper marks, then down to Harlan’s boot sealing the gap. “Placard tampering documented. Threshold denial documented.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re still tight to the wall opposite the Compliance intake door; the air is stale office-cold with a salt bite drifting in from the vents.

**MULTIPLE ACTIVE THREADS:** Vex stays half a pace back, repeating your instruction—“Placard first, witness in frame”—as Sorn’s lens tracks. From inside the room, paper shuffles faster, then stops dead as if they’ve frozen at the sound of the camera. Down the corridor behind Sorn, more distant boots approach—Authority backup drawn by the radio traffic, not yet visible.

Sorn speaks toward the door, voice flat with procedure. “Compliance intake, this is Oversight. Identify all persons inside and state purpose. Failure to comply is a reportable obstruction.” He gestures to the evidence bag and gloves. “If anything comes under that door, we bag it without contact and we log time to the second.”

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Lt. Sorn: on scene, filming  
- Second voice: partially captured  
- Placard tampering: documented by Oversight  
- Door gap: sealed, transfer denied

I keep my phone steady on the seam and Harlan’s boot, then say, “Sorn—audio picked up ‘Dain, don’t.’ If Inspector Rook is inside, I want him identified on record right now.”  

Toward the door, loud and level: “Compliance intake—state your full names, badge numbers, and show hands at the door window if you have one. No one’s leaving, and nothing’s passing under.”  

Low to Sorn: “Before they open anything, get that placard in close—if it’s a swap, it tells us whose door this really is.”

*Agent reasoning: That “Dain” slip is a knife in the dark—either Rook is in there or someone wants us to think he is. With Sorn here, I should press for names and keep the record airtight without escalating into a shove-fest.*

I keep my phone locked on the seam and Harlan’s boot. “Sorn—audio caught ‘Dain, don’t.’ If Inspector Dain Rook is in there, I want him ID’d on the record right now.”  

I raise my voice at the door: “Compliance intake—state full names and badge numbers. If there’s a window, hands up where we can see them. No one exits and nothing passes under.”  

Low to Sorn, I nod at the pried corner: “Before anybody opens anything, get a tight shot of that placard—if it’s a swap, it tells us whose door this really is.”

*Agent reasoning: With the scene going silent, I need to keep pressure on procedure—force IDs, keep the camera on the only routes out, and make sure Sorn documents the placard tampering before anyone can “reset” the story.*

### Turn 192 [PLAYER]

I keep my phone trained on the seam and Harlan’s boot, then murmur to Sorn, “Get that placard in close—tamper marks, screws, everything—before we touch a thing.”  
Toward the door, steady and loud: “Compliance intake—state full names and badge numbers, now. Identify if Inspector Dain Rook is inside. No one leaves and nothing passes under this door.”

*Agent reasoning: The silence is making my skin crawl—either they’re stalling to destroy something or the room isn’t what the placard says. I need Sorn’s camera on the placard and I need Control to lock this down before anyone opens the wrong door.*

### Turn 193 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Sorn leans in exactly where you indicated, his lens inches from the placard’s pried corner. He narrates as he films, procedural and cold. “Placard fasteners show fresh tool scoring. Upper-right corner lifted. Adhesive disturbed.” He tilts to catch the screw heads—one is mismatched, newer than the others, the slot chewed like it was rushed with the wrong driver.

Your phone stays locked on the seam and Harlan’s boot. Nothing slides under. But from inside, someone exhales hard—close to the door—then a man’s voice answers, careful and too calm: “This is Inspector Dain Rook, badge—” there’s a pause, like he’s looking for the number “—0417. With me is… Records Clerk Myra Venn. Badge 2239.” The woman doesn’t speak again, but you hear fabric shift near the door as if she’s being held back from it.

Sorn doesn’t look away from the placard when he replies. “Inspector Rook, confirm you are in possession of the Compliance intake key and that no evidence has been moved since threshold denial.” His tone makes it clear: he’s building a chain-of-custody trap.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re still in the service corridor outside **FILES/Compliance**, fluorescent light flickering; the air tastes like dust, cold metal, and that faint salt-thread riding the vent draft.

**MULTIPLE ACTIVE THREADS:** Vex stands behind Sorn, eyes on the far end of the hall where the sound of more boots is getting closer—Authority backup drawn by the raised voices. Harlan keeps his boot planted, calf trembling with the strain, radio clipped to his shoulder and recording. The placard’s edge, in Sorn’s close-up, shows a second layer beneath the top label—like an older identifier was covered rather than replaced cleanly.

Rook continues, voice tightening. “Oversight has no jurisdiction—this is an active safety sweep order under Commissioner Harrow.”

Sorn answers without heat. “Jurisdiction is why we’re filming. Open the door slowly and show hands at the seam. If you don’t, you’re documented obstructing.”

**ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT:** The longer this holds, the more likely Harrow’s sweep muscle arrives and turns a paperwork standoff into a physical one—especially if they think you’ve got Myra pinned inside.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Rook identified on record  
- Myra confirmed inside (per Rook)  
- Placard tampering filmed close-up

### Turn 194 [PLAYER]

I keep filming and call through the door, “Myra Venn—say, in your own words, if you’re safe and unrestrained. If you can’t speak freely, knock once for yes, twice for no.”  
To Sorn, low: “Get the older label under that placard on camera—peel nothing, just angle for the edge. And radio Control: Harrow’s sweep is inbound; we need a supervisor and medical on standby.”

*Agent reasoning: Rook’s ID is on record, but Myra sounds coerced and the placard looks like a cover-up. With Harrow’s muscle incoming, we need Myra speaking freely and the placard documented before any forced entry flips the story on us.*

### Turn 195 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Your call for Myra lands like a hook. Inside, there’s a sharp intake of breath—then silence. A second later: *knock… knock.* Two clean raps, close to the seam, like someone did it with knuckles and then froze.

Rook answers too fast, trying to bury it. “Myra is fine. She’s—she’s busy compiling—”

Sorn doesn’t give him room. Still filming, he shifts the angle on the placard without touching it, using the light glare off his screen to catch the lifted edge. In the close-up, the top placard curls just enough to show an older label beneath: **PUMP HOUSE ANNEX — INTAKE SERVICE**. The word *ANNEX* is partially obscured by adhesive smear, like it was deliberately covered in a hurry.

Sorn keys his radio, voice clipped. “Control, Oversight. Possible unlawful detention at FILES/Compliance corridor. Harrow sweep response inbound—request duty supervisor to corridor and medical staged. Documenting placard tamper and occupant nonverbal distress.” A burst of static, then Control: “Copy. Supervisor en route. Medical notified.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** The corridor’s fluorescents buzz overhead; the draft from the service chase tastes faintly of wet salt and old oil, colder than it should be this far from open water.

**MULTIPLE ACTIVE THREADS:** Harlan’s boot stays planted, but his radio mic clicks—someone’s calling him from the far end. Down the hall, approaching footsteps multiply and slow, like a group trying not to sound like a group. And inside the door, something small scrapes—metal on concrete—like a chair leg being pulled back from the seam.

Rook drops his voice, aimed at you through the door. “Calder, you don’t understand what you’re standing in front of. Step away and I can still keep your name out of Harrow’s sweep.”

Sorn, quiet to you, keeps the camera steady on the revealed under-label. “Annex intake. This isn’t just Compliance. This is a route.”

**ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT:** Supervisor and medical are coming—but so is Harrow’s sweep muscle. The longer the door stays closed, the more likely someone tries to “resolve” it before oversight arrives.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Myra signaled **unsafe** (2 knocks)  
- Under-placard label: **PUMP HOUSE ANNEX — INTAKE SERVICE**  
- Supervisor + medical requested; en route

### Turn 196 [PLAYER]

I keep my phone up and say through the door, “Inspector Rook, that was two knocks—‘not safe.’ If you touch her again, it’s on record. Put Myra at the seam, hands visible, now.”

Low to Sorn: “Annex intake… that’s waterline infrastructure. If they bolt, they’ll run her through the route—have Control lock down adjacent service access and stairwells.”

I call down the corridor toward the approaching boots, “Supervisor and medical en route—everyone arriving, stop at the line and stay in frame. Nobody rushes this door.”

*Agent reasoning: Myra’s two knocks means she’s not safe; Rook is trying to intimidate me and buy time until Harrow’s people arrive. I need to keep the situation documented, prevent them from “moving” her, and force a controlled opening with witnesses while calling out the annex label as probable misdirection.*

### Turn 198 [PLAYER]

I keep my phone steady on the seam. “Inspector Rook—two knocks is ‘not safe.’ Put Myra at the seam with both hands visible, now, or you’re on record for unlawful restraint.”  

I lean close to Sorn. “Tell Control: lock down all adjacent service access—stairwells, maintenance hatches, anything tied to Pump House Annex intake.”  

Then I raise my voice down the corridor at the incoming boots. “Hold at the line and stay in frame—no one rushes this door. Supervisor and medical are inbound; you move early, you own it on record.”

*Agent reasoning: Myra’s in danger and Rook’s stalling; I need to keep everyone on camera, force Myra into view, and prevent a run through the annex route before Harrow’s people arrive.*

### Turn 199 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Your words sharpen the corridor. Inside the door, there’s a muffled shuffle—then Myra’s voice, strained and close to the seam: “Rafe—” It cuts off mid-syllable like someone clapped a hand over her mouth. A beat later, her fingers appear under the gap—two pale hands pushed flat to the floor, trembling, nails dirty with ink. They stay there just long enough to be unmistakable on your recording before they’re yanked back out of sight.

Rook’s voice turns hard, no more pretense. “Step away from the door. Now. You’re escalating a safety sweep into—” He stops himself, breath hitching, as if someone else in the room is signaling him what to say.

Sorn, tight to your shoulder, radios Control as you asked. “Control, Oversight—lock down adjacent service access points tied to Pump House Annex intake: stairwells, maintenance hatches, service chase junctions. We have a live restraint and attempted movement risk.” Control comes back fast this time: “Copy. Initiating corridor and stairwell hold. Duty supervisor ETA two minutes.”

Down the corridor, the incoming boots arrive in a cluster: two Harbor Authority officers in sweep vests and a third in plainclothes with a flashlight held like a baton. Your “stay in frame” call checks them—barely. They slow at Harlan’s planted boot and Sorn’s camera, but the plainclothes man keeps edging, eyes flicking to the ceiling vents and the access panel behind you like he’s mapping exits.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re still pinned in the narrow service corridor outside FILES/Compliance; the air is cold and metallic, with that brine-and-oil draft breathing out of the wall seams.

**MULTIPLE ACTIVE THREADS:** Harlan’s calf shakes harder; he’s holding the line but he’s not built for a prolonged shove match. The pried placard corner lifts a hair more as pressure shifts behind the door—someone inside bumped it. And from somewhere deeper in the building, a distant door alarm chirps once, then cuts—like a lockout just started taking effect.

**ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT:** If Rook realizes the annex routes are being sealed, his next move is likely force—either to open the door outward into you, or to move Myra through an internal passage before the lockdown fully bites.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Myra’s hands shown on record  
- Rook escalated to threats  
- Annex access lockdown initiating  
- Sweep officers arrived at line

### Turn 200 [PLAYER]

I angle my phone to catch both the door seam and the sweep officers, and I point at the plainclothes man. “You—name and badge, right now. Keep that flashlight down and your hands where the camera can see them.”  

Then I call through the door, voice low but sharp: “Rook, I heard her. I saw her hands. Put Myra back at the seam—hands visible—and step back. If this door moves before the supervisor arrives, I’m treating it as a breach and you’re the one escalating.”  

I slide my shoulder closer to Harlan and murmur, “If they surge, don’t try to be a hero—let the door take the first inch and we pin it with weight,” then I glance at the access panel behind us and bark to Vex, “Watch that panel—if it pops, you shout and you film.”

*Agent reasoning: Myra’s voice and hands confirm she’s being restrained; Rook’s about to force a move. The plainclothes sweep guy is the biggest immediate threat in the hall, and we need to keep everyone in frame while buying two minutes for the supervisor—without letting them rush the door or peel off to an access panel.*

### Turn 201 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** The plainclothes man halts mid-step when you single him out. He lifts his empty hand, flashlight lowering a fraction, and says, “Tomas Vex. Special Liaison. Deputy Commissioner Kint.” He doesn’t produce a badge—just taps the inside of his coat where something hard sits, like he expects the title to do the work. Your phone catches his face, his hands, and the sweep vests behind him.

At the door, your warning lands. Inside: a strained pause, then Myra’s voice again, closer, controlled through pain. “I’m here. He’s—” A hand slaps the door from the inside—flat palm, not a knock code—then silence. The seam shows a thin line of shadow shifting as if someone inside leaned their weight against it, testing.

Rook answers, breath tight. “You’re not trained for this, Calder. You don’t know what’s in the intake route.” That’s the first time he’s admitted it out loud: **intake route**.

Harlan shifts with you—shoulder-to-shoulder—and nods once at your “first inch” plan, jaw clenched. He’s ready to take the hit, not the glory.

Behind you, the access panel gives a tiny metallic *tick*—not open, just unlatched enough to whisper. Vex’s eyes snap to it the instant you tell him to watch it; he’s been waiting for that moment. He raises his phone (not a duty cam—personal) and angles it at the panel like he wants proof of *someone else* breaking procedure.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re boxed in: FILES/Compliance door in front, service access panel behind, fog-cold air bleeding through the wall seams and tasting faintly of brine over disinfectant.

**MULTIPLE ACTIVE THREADS:** The two sweep-vest officers hang back at your “line,” but one keeps palming his radio like he’s getting updated orders. Sorn stays steady, camera trained, but he’s watching Vex now as much as the door. And from somewhere above the ceiling tiles, a soft scrape travels—like something being dragged along a duct run toward this corridor.

**ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT:** Lockdowns are starting, but they’re not instantaneous; if someone inside has a lead on an internal bypass (service chase/duct), they’ll try it before the supervisor arrives. If the door surges outward, you and Harlan take the impact first.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Plainclothes ID: “Tomas Vex” claimed  
- Rook admitted “intake route”  
- Access panel: latch just ticked  
- Myra audible again, cut off

### Turn 202 [PLAYER]

I keep filming and snap at the plainclothes, “Tomas Vex—badge out, on camera, now. If you won’t show it, you’re just a guy with a flashlight and you stay behind the line.”  

I press my weight into the door with Harlan, voice through the seam: “Myra—if you can hear me, knock once if you’re being moved away from the door.”  

Without taking my eyes off the seam, I bark to Sorn, “Camera on that access panel—now. Control needs to know we’ve got a bypass attempt behind us.” Then to Vex (our Vex), low and urgent: “If that panel opens, you shout ‘BREACH’ and don’t touch whoever comes through—just keep them in frame.”

*Agent reasoning: The panel ticking and duct scrape feel like a bypass attempt; I need eyes and cameras on both fronts while keeping pressure on Rook and pinning the door. Vex’s “liaison” act smells like cover—get him on record refusing to show badge and keep him away from the panel.*

### Turn 203 [GAME]

Vex stiffens when you demand the badge on camera. For half a second he looks like he’ll bluff through it—then Sorn’s lens shifts, catching him dead-on. Vex exhales and produces a leather folio, flipping it open just enough for a shield stamp and photo ID to flash in frame. He snaps it shut immediately. “Satisfied? Now stop turning this into theater.”

Harlan and you lean in together; the door gives a millimeter under your combined weight, then holds. Through the seam you call to Myra.

A single, sharp **knock** answers—too close to be from anywhere but the inside face of the door.

The space behind the door shifts at once: a scuff of shoes, a wet inhale, and a muffled grunt like someone just got pulled by the collar. Rook’s voice goes tight, low, meant for whoever’s with him more than for you. “No—leave her—”

Sorn pivots as you order, camera tracking to the access panel behind you. The panel’s bottom edge bows outward—just a hair—then a fingernail of darkness opens as the latch finally gives. Cold air spills out of it, carrying that brine-and-oil tang stronger, like a lung exhaling.

Your Vex (the one you’re warning) does exactly what you told him: he backs a half-step to keep the panel and corridor in frame, throat already primed.

From inside the wall, something scrapes forward—metal on metal—then stops, as if whoever’s in the service chase heard Sorn’s camera reposition and froze.

Down the corridor, the sweep-vest officers shift their stance when they hear the knock and see the panel move. One of them radios quietly, but you catch a fragment: “Kint liaison confirmed… breach risk…”

The corridor feels narrower now—door in front, panel behind—lights buzzing overhead, and the building’s ventilation carrying a thin, high whistle like it’s pulling air from somewhere it shouldn’t.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Vex ID briefly shown on camera  
- Myra signaled: being moved  
- Access panel: cracked open  
- Movement in service chase detected

### Turn 204 [PLAYER]

I keep my shoulder planted into the door with Harlan and bark, “Sorn—stay on that panel, full frame, and narrate time and actions out loud.”  

I jab a finger at the nearer sweep-vest officer. “You. Stand on the panel side—now—and keep your hands visible. If someone comes through, you stop them, you don’t disappear with them.”  

Into my phone, fast: “Control—active breach attempt via service chase behind FILES/Compliance door, Myra Venn signaled she’s being moved. Treat as unlawful detention in progress; send supervisor to this exact corridor and dispatch units to seal Pump House Annex intake endpoints.”  

Then through the seam, low and urgent: “Myra—stay loud if you can. If they gag you, kick the door again. We’re right here.”

*Agent reasoning: Myra’s being moved and we’ve got a bypass opening behind us; I can’t hold both fronts alone. I’ll pin the door with Harlan, put Sorn on the panel, and force the sweep officers to choose a side on camera while I call Control to escalate to an active breach/unlawful detention.*

### Turn 205 [GAME]

Sorn snaps to your order like it’s a lifeline. He plants his stance so the access panel fills most of the frame and starts talking in the flat, procedural cadence of someone building a case: “Time—zero one thirteen. Service access panel behind FILES/Compliance—partially opened. Officer Calder reporting attempted bypass. Observed movement in chase—metal scrape, then stop.”

The sweep-vest officer you point at hesitates—eyes flicking to Vex’s coat, then to Sorn’s camera. Your insistence on hands visible and “don’t disappear with them” hits a nerve. He steps over to the panel side, palms out where the lens can see them. “I’m not— I’m standing. I’m standing,” he mutters, like he’s trying to convince himself as much as you.

Your call to Control goes through clean. This time the voice on the other end doesn’t sound bored—it sounds scared of being on the wrong side of the record. “Copy, Calder. Supervisor en route. Units sealing Pump House Annex intake endpoints now. Maintain visual. Do not enter confined service spaces.”

The access panel flexes again. A hand appears—gloved, work-worn—fingers hooking the edge to pull it wider. Sorn’s narration tightens: “Hand visible in chase—glove, dark cuff—attempting to open—” The sweep-vest officer flinches but holds position, blocking the opening with his body angle without actually touching the hand.

From inside FILES/Compliance, Myra makes a sound—half gasp, half shout—then the dull thud of a shoulder or hip hitting the door from the other side. Not a full kick, but a desperate confirmation she’s still close enough to fight.

Rook’s voice cuts through the seam, sharp and furious now, aimed inward: “Stop—she stays quiet. We’re not—” The rest is swallowed by a scuffle, fabric rasping, and something hard clacking against metal—like a keyring or a stamp kit dropped.

The corridor’s air turns colder as the panel gap widens a fraction; it smells like wet concrete and brine, like the building’s guts have been rinsed with harbor water.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Control: supervisor + units dispatched  
- Sorn: panel filmed, narrated  
- Panel: gloved hand visible  
- Myra: impact on door heard

### Turn 206 [PLAYER]

I keep my shoulder braced on the door and raise my voice for the cameras. “Gloved hand in the panel—do not come out. You exit that chase and you’ll be detained on camera.”

I glance at the sweep-vest officer blocking the panel. “Hold that position—hands up, body in the way. If they push, you step back and we slam it shut, understood?”

Through the seam, I snap, “Rook, I heard the scuffle and I heard her hit the door. Put Myra back on the seam—hands visible—or I’m calling this a kidnapping and I’m kicking this door the second the supervisor arrives.”

*Agent reasoning: Myra’s still close and fighting; someone’s trying to bypass through the service chase. I need to keep everything on record, prevent anyone slipping out, and rattle whoever’s inside without escalating into a confined-space brawl.*

### Turn 207 [GAME]

Your voice carries clean down the corridor, and it changes the math immediately: the gloved hand in the access panel **freezes**, fingers still hooked on the lip like it got caught mid-theft. Sorn keeps the panel full-frame, narration steady: “Subject’s hand visible—ceased movement upon verbal warning.”

The sweep-vest officer swallows hard but nods at you without looking away from the opening. He angles his shoulder closer—hands up, body in the way—making himself an awkward human plug. Vex watches him do it with a tight, assessing stare, like he’s deciding whether this officer is a liability or a witness.

You’re still braced at the FILES/Compliance door—your shoulder and Harlan’s pressing into cold metal that vibrates faintly with the scuffle on the other side. The air here tastes like disinfectant cut with harbor brine, and the strip of light under the door flickers as feet shift inside.

At your demand, there’s a beat of silence—then Rook, right up against the seam, voice low and furious but controlled for the cameras outside. “Calder—she’s not kidnapped. She’s… being secured. There’s an intake corridor behind this room and someone’s trying to pull her through it.” He pauses, then adds, like it costs him: “That’s not me.”

A shape moves into the seam’s shadow from inside. Myra’s fingers appear first—two hands, shaking, palms splayed where the crack allows. Her nails are ink-stained; there’s a smear of black on her knuckle like she struck metal. She forces her voice through, ragged: “Rafe—he’s—” Something yanks her back; her fingertips scrape the door edge, leaving a dark streak.

Rook snaps, louder, to whoever’s inside with him: “Stop dragging her—now.” The scuffle shifts away from the door a step, and you hear a hard, wet cough like someone got the wind knocked out of them.

Behind you, the access panel hand withdraws a fraction, not retreating—**repositioning**, as if the person in the chase is preparing to shove or to slip something through instead of coming out. The building’s ductwork gives another soft scrape overhead, moving parallel to the corridor.

Time pressure tightens: Control said units are sealing the Pump House Annex endpoints—if the person in the chase realizes that, they may try to force this panel *now* before they’re trapped between sealed intakes and cameras.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Panel hand: froze, then repositioned  
- Myra: hands shown, yanked back  
- Rook: admits intake corridor threat  
- Scuffle: shifted away from door

### Turn 208 [PLAYER]

I keep my shoulder driving the door and bark, “Sorn—stay on that hand. If anything comes through, narrate it, don’t chase it.”  

I look hard at Vex (liaison). “If you’re really Kint’s man, order your sweep to put a cuff on that gloved wrist the second it crosses the threshold—on camera. No disappearing acts.”  

Then I raise my voice through the seam. “Rook—prove it’s ‘not you.’ Put Myra back to the seam and slide her ID badge or phone under the door. Then tell me, loud, who’s in that intake corridor with you.”

*Agent reasoning: Rook’s not the only problem—someone in the chase is about to force the panel, and Myra’s getting hauled. I need to keep cameras rolling, lock the panel without getting someone killed, and force Rook to give Myra to the seam again while we wait for the supervisor.*
