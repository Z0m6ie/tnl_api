He thinks about Mara’s face on the news and the way she used to hide fear behind jokes. He tells himself he wants truth. He knows he also wants someone to pay.\n\nHe runs routine anyway. He checks the street through the blinds. He writes times and plates in a notebook that smells like old paper. He keeps his burner face down beside a cold coffee. He counts slow breaths until the city noise turns into a pattern he can use.\n\nThe burner vibrates. A number he doesn’t know. He answers on the second ring and keeps his voice flat.\n\nA woman speaks. Calm. Trained. “Stop looking at the footage. Your sister didn’t do it. The timeline did.” She hangs up before he can ask a question.\n\nA text lands right after. An address. A file name: MARROW//SENN//WED-2311.\n\nElias opens his laptop and pulls street-cam archives through an old login he never uses twice. A clip loads. Nine minutes. A man in a suit enters an office. A gala badge flashes on his chest. Elias watches for hands. He watches for gaps.\n\nThe file blinks out. A clean loop replaces it. Same hallway. Same empty seconds. Someone notices him looking.\n\nHeadlights wash his wall through the blinds. A patrol car idles outside. The door downstairs buzzes once, then stops.\n\nPaper slides under his door. A note in block print. PAWNSHOP DEBTS DON’T DIE. YOUR FATHER’S LEDGER IS IN PLAY.\n\nElias stares at the address on his screen until the digits feel like a threat that needs an answer.",

The door bears the stylized marrow-thread logo you’ve seen on camera poles and lobby placards. Not police. Security pretending to be a civic service. Engine idling low, headlights off, just the dash glow.\n\nInside: two silhouettes. Driver sits still, head angled down as if reading a screen. Passenger shifts, the ember of a cigarette briefly flares, then dies. A radio mic hangs from the dash, but you don’t hear chatter—just the wet hush of tires on street and the distant rattle of the elevated line.\n\nYou wait for the hallway’s rhythm—old building, pipes ticking, a neighbor’s TV murmuring through plaster. No footsteps right outside.\n\nYou crack your door a finger-width. The corridor air is colder, smelling of mop water and stale smoke. The landing is empty—until a soft scrape comes from the stairwell below, like a shoe adjusting on concrete. Someone is there, not climbing, just… holding.\n\nA voice drifts up, quiet and conversational, aimed at your door without raising volume. “Mr. Vane. We’re not here to make a scene. Just need a word.”\n\nThe Marrowline cruiser outside doesn’t move, but the passenger’s head turns toward your window like they know exactly where you’re standing.\n\n**Status updates:**  \n- Laptop: powered down, battery pulled  \n- Note: bagged, prints preserved  \n- Outside: Marrowline unit observing  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"Bagged note (evidence sleeve)\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Vane Office (Harker Ave)\"],\"npcs_add\":[{\"name\":\"Marrowline Stairwell Voice (unknown)\",\"description\":\"Unseen person holding position on the stairwell below your landing; speaking calmly, wants to 'talk'.\"},{\"name\":\"Marrowline Cruiser Team (2)\",\"description\":\"Two operatives in a black-and-silver Marrowline cruiser outside; monitoring the building.\"}]}```",

Male, mid-30s maybe, practiced calm. “I’m with Marrowline. Not patrol—Compliance. The cruiser’s just visibility.” A faint rustle follows, like he’s adjusting a coat or shifting his stance on the step. “And you’re right. We don’t get to ‘just need a word.’ That’s why I’m asking instead of coming up.”\n\nYou slide your phone into your palm, angle your body toward the fire escape window. The glass there is beaded with rain; the metal frame sweats cold. From this angle you can catch a sliver of the alley—slick bricks, the fire escape ladder, and darkness pooling below.\n\nYou listen hard for a second set of steps.\n\nNothing above Kellan. Nothing behind him either—no double cadence, no whisper of fabric on drywall. But you do catch something else: a soft, almost inaudible *click* from the stairwell door at street level, like it was eased shut to keep the building quiet. Someone’s controlling sound, not making it.\n\nOutside, the cruiser passenger’s cigarette ember blooms again, then dims. The driver’s face glows from a screen; the light shifts like scrolling text.\n\nKellan continues, giving you a thin slice of truth as bait. “You pulled a clip that doesn’t exist anymore. That means you tripped a Marrowline audit flag. My job is to make sure you stop tripping it… before someone higher up decides you’re a liability.” He lets that hang, then adds, “Also—your sister’s name is being used to launder something. You keep pulling footage, you’ll end up wearing it.”\n\nThe rain picks up, harder against the window. The building’s pipes tick once, loud in the quiet.

The lamination’s scuffed at the corners like it’s been flashed a lot. The name reads **Kellan Rusk**; the photo is him in a neutral gray backdrop, eyes dead-on. The card: **MARROWLINE // COMPLIANCE**, a direct number, no slogan.\n\n“Audit flag,” he says, voice still calm, “is called a **WED-2311 divergence**. It’s not about *who* you are. It’s about the *shape* of the pull. Nine minutes of footage accessed through a deprecated municipal credential, from an endpoint that doesn’t belong to the city network. The system tags it as ‘legacy siphon’—and it pings Compliance because those pulls correlate with people who die inconveniently.” A beat. “That’s what only I’d know: the divergence label and the trigger profile. Nobody outside Marrowline calls it that.”\n\nWhile he talks, you drift back toward the fire escape window on the west wall. Rain beads on the glass, neon from the street painting it sickly pink. You test the latch with two fingers, slow.\n\nIt gives—barely. The window sticks from old paint, but it *will* open if you commit to it. The frame creaks once, small but sharp in the quiet hall.\n\nFrom the alley below: a faint scrape of rubber on wet brick, then the soft clink of metal—like a ladder rung being steadied or a fire escape joint taking weight. Not loud. Intentional.\n\nOutside, the cruiser’s engine note changes—idle dips, then steadies—like the driver just got a message.\n\nKellan’s tone tightens a fraction. “If you’re thinking exit, don’t do it blind.

Cold air needles your knuckles. From this west-facing slit you get a slice of the alley: wet brick, the black spine of the fire escape, trash bags shining like oil.\n\nMovement: a figure tucked under the fire escape landing, half-hidden by shadow and a dripping downspout. Not Marrowline-uniform obvious—dark hood, workman’s jacket. They’re close enough you can see their shoulders rise as they breathe.

They do something worse: they stop moving like they’ve been trained to vanish into stillness.\n\nFrom the stairwell, Kellan lowers his voice. “Listen to me. If someone’s in your alley, it’s not Compliance. It’s either Patrol freelancing, or Union debt-collectors, or someone Calder hired who doesn’t care about cameras because they *own* the story afterward.” He swallows a beat. “Don’t open that window further. And don’t call 911 from that phone if you’ve been hitting street-cam archives—Marrowline tags emergency pings in flagged buildings. You’ll turn this into a beacon.”\n\nOutside, the cruiser’s engine note bumps again.

The long narrow object angles down out of sight.\n\nIn the stairwell, Kellan exhales like he’s deciding how much leverage to give you.

I’m here to talk.”\n\nA beat—then his tone turns bitter. “Cruiser doesn’t take orders from me. Different division. Patrol answers to Operations, and Operations answers to whoever’s paying for ‘visibility’ tonight.” He pauses, listening toward street level. “But I can try.”\n\nYou hear him call down, not shouting—more like a coded professionalism. “Unit on Harker, this is Compliance Rusk. Light up. Now.”\n\nOutside, the cruiser doesn’t flip full reds-and-blues.

You get your shoulder into it and shove—slow, controlled, no scrape if you can help it—until the cabinet kisses the wall and **pins the lower window frame from the inside**.\n\nImmediate effect: the wedge pressure outside meets resistance. The sash gives a tiny, angry *creak*… then stops moving. Whoever’s on the fire escape tries again—harder—and the whole window trembles, but it doesn’t spread. Not yet.\n\nOutside, you catch a shadow shift across the rain-streaked glass—someone repositioning their feet on the grate. A second tool taps the frame, testing for a weaker point. The rain and traffic hiss make it hard to place, but the rhythm is patient: they’re not panicking, they’re working.\n\nYou whisper up to Kellan. From the stairwell above: “Copy. Listening. If they break glass or hit the gate, I’ll call it—” Then, quieter, just for you: “Elias… I heard him say ‘Marrowline won’t want bodies.’ That means they might take you alive.”\n\nIn the hall, the hooded man’s voice comes faint through the door now, talking into his mic: “He braced it. Try the latch side—don’t crack it unless you have to.” Then his footsteps retreat a few paces, like he’s giving the window man room.\n\nDown on the street, that Marrowline sedan’s engine turns over again, and headlights sweep across your frosted office glass—somebody’s shifting position to watch the fire escape line.\n\nYou tighten your grip on the lamp with both hands.

From here, the window is to your left, the door to your right; you’re tucked where neither has a clean line on your chest.\n\nThe building gives you one sharp, telling sound: a soft *metallic tick* at the window latch—too crisp to be settling wood. A second later, the sash exhales a hairline *creeeak* as the wedge bites again. Your cabinet brace holds, but the latch side is being worried like a loose tooth.\n\nUp the stairwell, Kellan answers your whisper without coming closer. “Got it.” Then he raises his voice, projecting down the hall like he’s talking to an approaching squad: “Units are at the front door—right now. Don’t move. Hands where I can see them.” He’s selling it hard.\n\nThe effect is immediate on the other side of the glass: the pressure stops.

That’s not a kid running.”\n\nYou whisper to the phone, barely moving your lips. “Kellan, stay on that landing and don’t engage—just tell me if anyone comes back up.”\n\nKellan answers immediately, hushed: “Copy.

Outside, the posted unit shifts, hand near his belt, listening hard.\n\nPritchard keys his shoulder mic, voice clipped and careful. “Alley unit: hold cover, get make/model, any marks, attempt plate. Compare to earlier partial—…7K3—advise. Do not approach solo.”\n\nHe looks back to you. “If it’s the same car, that ties your earlier observation to an active interference.

Through the stairwell, voices below carry in chopped pieces—Marrowline staying close enough to be heard, not close enough to be touched.\n\nPritchard flips a page in his notebook and speaks while he writes. “I’ll put it in plain language: Marrowline personnel attempted to direct officers, demanded access to witnesses, and requested identifying information. Names if we get them—right now I’ve got a male voice claiming ‘Compliance’ and at least one other adult male, dark jacket, earpiece. Mott’s bodycam has the rest if she was facing them.”\n\nMott shifts her stance at the door, eyes hard. “Second unit’s almost here. When they arrive, I’ll take them up the stairwell and sweep down the hall—slow, hands-on doors, check alcoves. If anyone’s loitering, we’ll ID them or move them along.”\n\nPritchard lowers his voice to match yours. “Yes—your office network and phone could be compromised without you ever touching anything. If they’ve got access to camera infrastructure, they can also have access to the *people* who manage it. Powering down is smart. If you’ve got evidence-sensitive devices, keep them on your person and don’t leave them unattended.”\n\nHe glances toward the door seam like he can see through it. “Statement-wise: give me **times, what you saw, what was said, where you were standing**, the partial plate, the no-headlights movement, and the fact you felt pressured. Do **not** say anything about ‘rewriting feeds,’ missing footage, burner calls, or anything tying this to a bigger pattern while their reps are in the building.

They’re spooked, but they’ll stay put.”\n\nAs he pockets the phone, his radio—still palmed—catches a hot mic burst: a man’s voice, not Pritchard’s, low and annoyed. “…rear door’s been touched. Check the second floor—quiet.”\n\nPritchard and Mott both freeze at the same time.

I can feel warm air—laundry vents. If they’re covering exits, they’ll check for drafts.” He pauses, then adds, almost to himself: “Union cadence… that means somebody paid twice.”\n\nOn the other side of the grate, one of the basement men shifts closer. A flashlight beam slides under the grate’s bottom edge, probing the floor. “Hold up,” the bored one mutters. “Thought I heard metal.”\n\nThe professional voice answers, calm: “Probably settling. Stay on it.”\n\n**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re now in a tight vertical pipe chase above the coal-jog passage, shoulders brushing cold pipes; below, the half-seated panel hides the opening like a bad lie.\n\nMarrowline boots reposition somewhere in the basement beyond the grate; their light keeps sweeping. Above you, the chase narrows toward a slatted vent where faint, humid air pulses—warm, detergent-sweet—like a lung.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES**\n- Pipe chase: entered, concealed\n- Gas: slowed by panel\n- Basement: alert, searching\n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Inside pipe chase\"],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```",

Okay. One minute is expensive.”\n\nThe corridor door to laundry bangs open and fluorescent light spills across the floor.

It sticks sometimes. Kick it *down*, don’t pull.”\n\nAs he says it, you hear the pipe-chase climbers below pause—listening—then redirect. A voice echoes up the metal: “Basement team, hold.

The chase goes dead quiet except for distant building hum.\n\nYou reach above-left with two fingers, moving like you’re reading Braille. After a few inches of smooth duct wall you find it: a rectangular grille frame set into the side of the vertical run, its edge packed with dust and a thin gasket. The cool draft is coming through it. The frame has two slotted screws—old, slightly rounded—meant to be serviced from *your* side. You whisper, “Exit left—maybe,” and Pritchard’s eyes cut to the screws, then back down the shaft.\n\nThe belt-clip click above shifts—closer by a step, then stops. A voice, muted through metal, says to someone nearby: “He’s in the rise. Don’t lean on it—listen.” Not Marrowline-polite. More like a building tech who’s done ugly work before.\n\nBelow, the climber in the chase bumps a rung—just once—and catches himself. You hear a controlled exhale, then a low mutter: “He stopped. He’s waiting.”\n\nFrom the corridor side (farther away now), the woman’s voice floats faintly, talking into a radio: “He found the draft. He’ll try the vent. If you’ve got eyes on laundry ceiling, hold them.”\n\nPritchard leans in until his mouth is near your ear, barely a breath: “Laundry ceiling… that’s above the second-floor staging. If that grille dumps there, it’s not outside. It’s *busier*.”\n\n**SENSORY GROUNDING:** Three rungs up in the vertical run; your fingertips rest on a dust-caked grille frame above-left, cold air slipping through like it’s been waiting.\n\n**MULTIPLE ACTIVE THREADS:** Someone up-level is now listening for you rather than moving; the basement climber is inside the same shaft, careful but closing; and the corridor team is coordinating coverage of a likely exit point—“laundry ceiling”—which suggests this vent ties back into the building’s service spaces, not the street.\n\n**STATUS UPDATES**\n- Grille located: serviceable from inside  \n- Upper-level listener: holding position  \n- Basement climber: advancing slowly",

No spring latch. The frame is seated on a gasket and held by those two slotted screws—*but* the lower-right corner has a hair of play, like it’s been removed recently and put back in a hurry. Enough that you could flex it a millimeter… not enough to pop it without tools or noise.\n\nOn the other side: fabric rustle, then the soft *tick* again—belt clip, close. A man clears his throat like he’s trying not to. Then, right over your ear through the grille, a low voice: “He’s right here.” Not shouted—spoken to someone in the room.\n\nYou freeze instantly, mouth “Covered,” and hold. Pritchard’s eyes harden; he doesn’t move, but his hand drifts toward his belt like he’s remembering he doesn’t have a gun in a ventilation shaft.\n\nA second voice answers farther away, female, impatient: “Don’t open it. Flood it.” There’s a pause. “Compliance wants him breathing.”\n\nBelow you, the basement climber stops climbing. You hear him listen, then whisper up to his partner: “He’s at the side vent.

But the air moves weird down here.” The tech on the ladder adds, “Grid’s clean on this run. No broken clips.”\n\nThat last line matters: they’re realizing someone moved through without leaving obvious ceiling damage—meaning they’ll start thinking **walls, panels, and service bays** next.\n\n**Environmental context:** the longer the floor man lingers, the more likely he gets bored of looking up and starts checking recesses at hand level—alcoves like yours are the first thing a tired pro clears when the ceiling comes up empty.\n\n**Status updates**\n- Floor searcher: at return line  \n- Flashlight: grazed alcove edge  \n- Team: shifting to “air movement” clues",

Don’t chase sound.

He’s not here.” Another: “Check the louvers—now.” A gloved hand scrapes at the collar area you just abandoned—too late, but close enough that the vibration trembles through the duct and into your teeth.\n\nFrom the penthouse corridor side, a radio bleeds through the metal in a different tone—calm, managerial: “Do not enter the ductwork.

He thinks about Mara’s face on the news and the way she used to hide fear behind jokes. He tells himself he wants truth. He knows he also wants someone to pay.\n\nHe runs routine anyway. He checks the street through the blinds. He writes times and plates in a notebook that smells like old paper. He keeps his burner face down beside a cold coffee. He counts slow breaths until the city noise turns into a pattern he can use.\n\nThe burner vibrates. A number he doesn’t know. He answers on the second ring and keeps his voice flat.\n\nA woman speaks. Calm. Trained. “Stop looking at the footage. Your sister didn’t do it. The timeline did.” She hangs up before he can ask a question.\n\nA text lands right after. An address. A file name: MARROW//SENN//WED-2311.\n\nElias opens his laptop and pulls street-cam archives through an old login he never uses twice. A clip loads. Nine minutes. A man in a suit enters an office. A gala badge flashes on his chest. Elias watches for hands. He watches for gaps.\n\nThe file blinks out. A clean loop replaces it. Same hallway. Same empty seconds. Someone notices him looking.\n\nHeadlights wash his wall through the blinds. A patrol car idles outside. The door downstairs buzzes once, then stops.\n\nPaper slides under his door. A note in block print. PAWNSHOP DEBTS DON’T DIE. YOUR FATHER’S LEDGER IS IN PLAY.\n\nElias stares at the address on his screen until the digits feel like a threat that needs an answer."

The paper’s dry and cheap; the ink’s slightly raised, like it came off an old impact printer.\n\nAt the blinds, you peel a corner back.\n\nDown on Harker, the “patrol” is a Marrowline cruiser—black-and-silver, not city blue. The door bears the stylized marrow-thread logo you’ve seen on camera poles and lobby placards. Not police. Security pretending to be a civic service. Engine idling low, headlights off, just the dash glow.\n\nInside: two silhouettes. Driver sits still, head angled down as if reading a screen. Passenger shifts, the ember of a cigarette briefly flares, then dies. A radio mic hangs from the dash, but you don’t hear chatter—just the wet hush of tires on street and the distant rattle of the elevated line.\n\nYou wait for the hallway’s rhythm—old building, pipes ticking, a neighbor’s TV murmuring through plaster. No footsteps right outside.\n\nYou crack your door a finger-width. The corridor air is colder, smelling of mop water and stale smoke. The landing is empty—until a soft scrape comes from the stairwell below, like a shoe adjusting on concrete. Someone is there, not climbing, just… holding.\n\nA voice drifts up, quiet and conversational, aimed at your door without raising volume. “Mr. Vane. We’re not here to make a scene. Just need a word.”\n\nThe Marrowline cruiser outside doesn’t move, but the passenger’s head turns toward your window like they know exactly where you’re standing.\n\n**Status updates:**  \n- Laptop: powered down, battery pulled  \n- Note: bagged, prints preserved  \n- Outside: Marrowline unit observing  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[\"Bagged note (evidence sleeve)\"],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[\"Vane Office (Harker Ave)\"],\"npcs_add\":[{\"name\":\"Marrowline Stairwell Voice (unknown)\",\"description\":\"Unseen person holding position on the stairwell below your landing; speaking calmly, wants to 'talk'.\"},{\"name\":\"Marrowline Cruiser Team (2)\",\"description\":\"Two operatives in a black-and-silver Marrowline cruiser outside; monitoring the building.\"}]}```"

Male, mid-30s maybe, practiced calm. “I’m with Marrowline. Not patrol—Compliance. The cruiser’s just visibility.” A faint rustle follows, like he’s adjusting a coat or shifting his stance on the step. “And you’re right. We don’t get to ‘just need a word.’ That’s why I’m asking instead of coming up.”\n\nYou slide your phone into your palm, angle your body toward the fire escape window. The glass there is beaded with rain; the metal frame sweats cold. From this angle you can catch a sliver of the alley—slick bricks, the fire escape ladder, and darkness pooling below.\n\nYou listen hard for a second set of steps.\n\nNothing above Kellan. Nothing behind him either—no double cadence, no whisper of fabric on drywall. But you do catch something else: a soft, almost inaudible *click* from the stairwell door at street level, like it was eased shut to keep the building quiet. Someone’s controlling sound, not making it.\n\nOutside, the cruiser passenger’s cigarette ember blooms again, then dims. The driver’s face glows from a screen; the light shifts like scrolling text.\n\nKellan continues, giving you a thin slice of truth as bait. “You pulled a clip that doesn’t exist anymore. That means you tripped a Marrowline audit flag. My job is to make sure you stop tripping it… before someone higher up decides you’re a liability.” He lets that hang, then adds, “Also—your sister’s name is being used to launder something. You keep pulling footage, you’ll end up wearing it.”\n\nThe rain picks up, harder against the window. The building’s pipes tick once, loud in the quiet.

The lamination’s scuffed at the corners like it’s been flashed a lot. The name reads **Kellan Rusk**; the photo is him in a neutral gray backdrop, eyes dead-on. The card: **MARROWLINE // COMPLIANCE**, a direct number, no slogan.\n\n“Audit flag,” he says, voice still calm, “is called a **WED-2311 divergence**. It’s not about *who* you are. It’s about the *shape* of the pull. Nine minutes of footage accessed through a deprecated municipal credential, from an endpoint that doesn’t belong to the city network. The system tags it as ‘legacy siphon’—and it pings Compliance because those pulls correlate with people who die inconveniently.” A beat. “That’s what only I’d know: the divergence label and the trigger profile. Nobody outside Marrowline calls it that.”\n\nWhile he talks, you drift back toward the fire escape window on the west wall. Rain beads on the glass, neon from the street painting it sickly pink. You test the latch with two fingers, slow.\n\nIt gives—barely. The window sticks from old paint, but it *will* open if you commit to it. The frame creaks once, small but sharp in the quiet hall.\n\nFrom the alley below: a faint scrape of rubber on wet brick, then the soft clink of metal—like a ladder rung being steadied or a fire escape joint taking weight. Not loud. Intentional.\n\nOutside, the cruiser’s engine note changes—idle dips, then steadies—like the driver just got a message.\n\nKellan’s tone tightens a fraction. “If you’re thinking exit, don’t do it blind.

Cold air needles your knuckles. From this west-facing slit you get a slice of the alley: wet brick, the black spine of the fire escape, trash bags shining like oil.\n\nMovement: a figure tucked under the fire escape landing, half-hidden by shadow and a dripping downspout. Not Marrowline-uniform obvious—dark hood, workman’s jacket. They’re close enough you can see their shoulders rise as they breathe. One hand is on the fire escape ladder rail like they were testing weight; the other holds something long and narrow—could be a pry bar, could be a compact tool case.\n\nAs you speak your line—“freeze and step back into the light”—the figure doesn’t step out. They do something worse: they stop moving like they’ve been trained to vanish into stillness.\n\nFrom the stairwell, Kellan lowers his voice. “Listen to me. If someone’s in your alley, it’s not Compliance. It’s either Patrol freelancing, or Union debt-collectors, or someone Calder hired who doesn’t care about cameras because they *own* the story afterward.” He swallows a beat. “Don’t open that window further. And don’t call 911 from that phone if you’ve been hitting street-cam archives—Marrowline tags emergency pings in flagged buildings. You’ll turn this into a beacon.”\n\nOutside, the cruiser’s engine note bumps again. Headlights stay dark, but the dash glow brightens as if a screen just went full white.\n\nYour thumb hovers over the 911 call.

The beam stripes across rain-slick metal and brick, catching the fire escape’s underside—and for half a second it finds the hooded figure’s sleeve and knuckles on the ladder rail. They flinch back into the geometry of shadow like they’ve practiced disappearing. The long narrow object angles down out of sight.\n\nIn the stairwell, Kellan exhales like he’s deciding how much leverage to give you. Then you hear him do what you asked: slow steps *down* the stairs, deliberately loud, hands empty enough to sound like nothing but shoes and fabric.\n\n“Good,” he says from lower down, keeping his voice pitched so it carries up to you. “Both hands are free. I’m here to talk.”\n\nA beat—then his tone turns bitter. “Cruiser doesn’t take orders from me. Different division. Patrol answers to Operations, and Operations answers to whoever’s paying for ‘visibility’ tonight.” He pauses, listening toward street level. “But I can try.”\n\nYou hear him call down, not shouting—more like a coded professionalism. “Unit on Harker, this is Compliance Rusk. Light up. Now.”\n\nOutside, the cruiser doesn’t flip full reds-and-blues. Instead, its parking lights come on—dim amber halos—followed by a brief, bright wash as the headlights flick on for a two-count and then drop back down. Not obedience. A warning. Or a signal.\n\nKellan catches it too. “That wasn’t for you,” he says quietly. “That was for *him*.”\n\nIn the alley, water starts dripping faster off the fire escape—vibrations traveling through the frame.

That headlight flash is a mark—‘target present, window side.’ It’s for the climber.”\n\nYou hear fabric rasp on the stairs as he leans on the rail. “What he wants? Not your wallet. Not your TV. He wants what you pulled: **MARROW//SENN//WED-2311**. The file name’s already in their chatter. If you accessed it, you’re the only person tonight who can prove the timeline was cut and re-stitched.”\n\nOutside to the west, a soft metallic *clack* carries through the brick: the fire escape ladder being lifted a fraction and set back down—testing. Then a quieter sound, close to the window line: something hard touching metal, like a pry tip finding purchase. No glass breaks yet, but the frame gives a tiny complainting squeal.\n\nFrom the front, under the door, a second shadow slides across the seam—someone shifting position in the hall or just past the stairwell entry. The cruiser remains out front with its dim ambers, idling steady, the kind of steady that says they’re not leaving.\n\nKellan adds, “If you call 911, don’t say ‘Marrowline.’ Say ‘unknown male on fire escape attempting entry.’ Keep it dumb. Keep it clean. And—Elias—don’t let them take you alive on camera.”\n\n**Status updates**\n- 911: ready to place call  \n- Fire escape: pry pressure starting  \n- Kellan: confirms “mark” signal  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}```"

A hand shoots through holding something flat and dark—a pry bar or a slim jim—jabbing down toward the strap like they’re trying to cut or hook it.\n\nIn the hall, the hooded man’s voice is right there now, breathy with effort: “Get it—get it—” The deeper second voice answers, colder: “Cops are here. Two minutes, tops.”\n\nUp the stairwell, Kellan whispers, strained: “I’ve got eyes—third floor landing, outside your suite. I can hear them at your door.” Then he raises his voice, selling to the building: “Third floor! They’re on the third—move!”\n\nOutside the west window, the Marrowline sedan’s headlights dim for a second—like the driver just killed them—then the engine revs and the car rolls, repositioning again. Whoever’s watching doesn’t want to be seen when uniforms hit the curb.\n\n**Status updates**\n- Door chain plate: torn free  \n- Door gap: partial, blocked by strap brace  \n- Police: on scene (arriving)  \n- Marrowline sedan: lights off, moving  \n\n```json\n{\"inventory_add\":[],\"inventory_remove\":[],\"abilities_add\":[],\"locations_add\":[],\"npcs_add\":[]}\n```"

You’re doing it right.” He taps his notebook once. “Right now, your office is a **potential** crime scene because of the attempted entry and the 911. That means *we* decide who goes in. I’m not searching without a reason I can articulate, and I’m not letting Marrowline ‘secure’ anything. If I need inside, I’ll ask you for consent. If you say no, I either walk away or I go warrant. That’s the line.”\n\nMott’s radio chirps; she turns her shoulder away, listening. A second later her eyes flick to you. “Dispatch generated the event. Working number incoming.”\n\nKellan nods at your coaching, lips pressed tight, hands visible on his knees. He looks like he wants to talk himself safe and knows he can’t.\n\nPritchard continues, voice low. “Exit plan: I’ll have Mott take you out the **rear service**—alley side—after we finish. We’ll stage a unit at the mouth so you can get picked up on the avenue, not at your curb. Marrowline approaches you, we document it, and I make it a problem for them.” He pauses. “But understand: they play in the gray. They’ll try to make you step into it.”\n\nFrom outside, muffled through plaster and the strip of hallway, a deeper engine note rises and then settles—like a vehicle rolling forward and stopping short. Not a patrol idle. Heavier. Deliberate.\n\nMott keys her mic once more, clipped. “Dispatch, confirm working number.” The reply is thin but clear: “Event number 26-0416-198. Units en route holding.”\n\nPritchard repeats it so it sticks. “Two-six, zero-four-one-six, one-nine-eight. Write it down.

Confirm clear. Eyes on, not a walkabout.”\n\nA pause. Then the officer’s voice comes back, filtered and tight: “Rear hallway clear to the service door.

The louvers are dusty and slightly oily; if you can get it off, it’s a sideways exit into the penthouse ductwork instead of through the main hatch.\n\nThrough the hairline crack you kept, you flick a bit of grit toward the west conduit run. It lands with a soft *tick…tick* against metal.\n\nFor half a second nothing.\n\nThen the boots you saw earlier stop pacing. A radio squawks low. The door-post’s shadow shifts—weight shifting, not leaving. A cautious voice, close and muffled, says: “Heard that. West side.” Another voice answers from deeper in the penthouse corridor: “Hold. Don’t chase sound. Compliance wants eyes on hatch.”\n\nSo the decoy works—**it pulls their attention**, but their orders keep them anchored.\n\nPritchard comes in tight, whispering through his own tension: “Scope’s close.

When you slip your fingers into the duct collar, you find **clearance**—a rectangular duct run just beyond the collar, big enough to take a shoulder if you angle in. The inside is lined with gritty insulation and a film of oily dust; it’s cold, and it smells like old rain and machine breath.\n\nTo your right, through the hairline gap of the gasketed hatch, the penthouse corridor’s sodium spill still leaks under that door. The door-post’s shadow hasn’t left, but it’s shifted closer to the seam as if listening harder now that the riser has gone quiet.\n\nBelow, the snake-cam team is right on top of your level. You hear the tech whisper, excited and tight: “I’m at the hatch—” then a sharper voice cuts in: “Hands off until we confirm. He’s not dumb.”\n\nPritchard comes back in your ear, barely audible: “Copy. I’m listening. If they say ‘visual,’ you won’t hear my whisper—you’ll hear me yell.” A beat, then: “They’re stacking below. I caught ‘two up, one holds corridor.’ And Vane—Marrowline’s Compliance line just said: ‘If he vanishes, lock the feeds and log the time.’ That’s… not a normal arrest.”\n\nIn the penthouse space, a radio murmur bleeds through the door seam: “—don’t touch the roof hatch.

He’s not here.” Another: “Check the louvers—now.” A gloved hand scrapes at the collar area you just abandoned—too late, but close enough that the vibration trembles through the duct and into your teeth.\n\nFrom the penthouse corridor side, a radio bleeds through the metal in a different tone—calm, managerial: “Do not enter the ductwork. Seal the riser tie-in. We need him alive and *unseen*.” That last word lands wrong, like it’s written into procedure.\n\nIn the duct ahead of you, you catch it: **a second presence**—not footsteps, but the soft, periodic *tink…tink* of something tapping metal, like a loose hanger wire or a cable tie flicking with airflow.
