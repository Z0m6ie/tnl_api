### Turn 4 [PLAYER]

Elias Vane grew up in the back rooms of a failing pawnshop, learning early to read people by what they tried to hide. A private investigator who specializes in quiet surveillance and post-midnight legwork, he moves through the city like a shadow with a notebook. Careful, observant, and relentlessly patient, Elias thinks three steps ahead before he ever knocks on a door. He’s determined to uncover who framed his estranged sister for a murder she didn’t commit, even if the truth costs him what’s left of his conscience.

*Agent reasoning: Generated cautious-style character for Noir Mystery*

### Turn 5 [GAME]

Here's your character:

**Elias Vane**
*Private Investigator specializing in surveillance and late-night fieldwork*

Elias Vane was raised in the back rooms of a dying pawnshop, where the clink of pocket watches and the hush of desperate deals taught him to read lies in a person’s hands and eyes. After a brief stint as a process server that sharpened his instincts for tailing people without being seen, he went private and built a reputation for quiet surveillance and after-hours legwork. Now he works the city’s sleepless veins with a notebook and a burner phone, haunted by the sense that he’s one bad choice away from becoming the kind of man he hunts.

**Traits:** Careful, Observant, Relentlessly patient, Cynically principled, Methodical
**Goal:** Uncover who framed his estranged sister for a murder she didn’t commit and dismantle the network behind it, even if doing so forces him to burn favors, betray allies, and sacrifice what remains of his conscience.

### Turn 9 [GAME]

2:17 a.m., Elias Vane sits in his one-room office above a closed laundromat on Harker Avenue. Rain ticks the window like a cheap clock that won’t stop. He thinks about Mara’s face on the news and the way she used to hide fear behind jokes. He tells himself he wants truth. He knows he also wants someone to pay.

He runs routine anyway. He checks the street through the blinds. He writes times and plates in a notebook that smells like old paper. He keeps his burner face down beside a cold coffee. He counts slow breaths until the city noise turns into a pattern he can use.

The burner vibrates. A number he doesn’t know. He answers on the second ring and keeps his voice flat.

A woman speaks. Calm. Trained. “Stop looking at the footage. Your sister didn’t do it. The timeline did.” She hangs up before he can ask a question.

A text lands right after. An address. A file name: MARROW//SENN//WED-2311.

Elias opens his laptop and pulls street-cam archives through an old login he never uses twice. A clip loads. Nine minutes. A man in a suit enters an office. A gala badge flashes on his chest. Elias watches for hands. He watches for gaps.

The file blinks out. A clean loop replaces it. Same hallway. Same empty seconds. Someone notices him looking.

Headlights wash his wall through the blinds. A patrol car idles outside. The door downstairs buzzes once, then stops.

Paper slides under his door. A note in block print. PAWNSHOP DEBTS DON’T DIE. YOUR FATHER’S LEDGER IS IN PLAY.

Elias stares at the address on his screen until the digits feel like a threat that needs an answer.

### Turn 10 [PLAYER]

I kill the laptop’s Wi‑Fi, yank the battery, and bag the note with a tissue so I don’t smear prints. Then I ease to the blinds and watch the patrol car—who’s inside, is it marked, and are they actually police? If the hallway’s clear, I quietly crack the door a finger-width and listen for footsteps near my threshold.

*Agent reasoning: There are multiple pressures at once—possible cops outside, someone slipping notes, and a compromised laptop. I need to avoid walking into an ambush; first I’ll verify what’s outside and preserve any evidence before making a move.*

### Turn 11 [GAME]

You kill the Wi‑Fi toggle first, then pop the battery like you’ve done it a hundred times—clean, quick, no drama. The laptop dies mid-fan whine. Whatever was watching your connection just lost its easy line.

You pinch the note with a tissue, slide it into a spare evidence sleeve from your desk drawer, and seal it. The paper’s dry and cheap; the ink’s slightly raised, like it came off an old impact printer.

At the blinds, you peel a corner back.

Down on Harker, the “patrol” is a Marrowline cruiser—black-and-silver, not city blue. The door bears the stylized marrow-thread logo you’ve seen on camera poles and lobby placards. Not police. Security pretending to be a civic service. Engine idling low, headlights off, just the dash glow.

Inside: two silhouettes. Driver sits still, head angled down as if reading a screen. Passenger shifts, the ember of a cigarette briefly flares, then dies. A radio mic hangs from the dash, but you don’t hear chatter—just the wet hush of tires on street and the distant rattle of the elevated line.

You wait for the hallway’s rhythm—old building, pipes ticking, a neighbor’s TV murmuring through plaster. No footsteps right outside.

You crack your door a finger-width. The corridor air is colder, smelling of mop water and stale smoke. The landing is empty—until a soft scrape comes from the stairwell below, like a shoe adjusting on concrete. Someone is there, not climbing, just… holding.

A voice drifts up, quiet and conversational, aimed at your door without raising volume. “Mr. Vane. We’re not here to make a scene. Just need a word.”

The Marrowline cruiser outside doesn’t move, but the passenger’s head turns toward your window like they know exactly where you’re standing.

**Status updates:**  
- Laptop: powered down, battery pulled  
- Note: bagged, prints preserved  
- Outside: Marrowline unit observing  

```json
{"inventory_add":["Bagged note (evidence sleeve)"],"inventory_remove":[],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":["Vane Office (Harker Ave)"],"npcs_add":[{"name":"Marrowline Stairwell Voice (unknown)","description":"Unseen person holding position on the stairwell below your landing; speaking calmly, wants to 'talk'."},{"name":"Marrowline Cruiser Team (2)","description":"Two operatives in a black-and-silver Marrowline cruiser outside; monitoring the building."}]}```

### Turn 12 [PLAYER]

I keep the chain on and the door barely cracked. “Say your name and who you’re with—Marrowline doesn’t get to ‘just need a word’ at my threshold.” While I talk, I slide my phone into my palm and angle toward the fire escape window, listening for any second set of steps coming up behind the stairwell voice.

*Agent reasoning: Marrowline isn’t police, and they’ve got angles on me. I need information without giving them my position or opening myself up to a rush; stall, confirm identity, and prep an exit/defense.*

### Turn 13 [GAME]

Your voice stays low, controlled, and the chain keeps the door honest. The crack is just enough to let sound travel and a bad decision hesitate.

There’s a pause from the stairwell—like the person is weighing whether you’re worth the effort.

“Name’s Kellan,” the voice says. Male, mid-30s maybe, practiced calm. “I’m with Marrowline. Not patrol—Compliance. The cruiser’s just visibility.” A faint rustle follows, like he’s adjusting a coat or shifting his stance on the step. “And you’re right. We don’t get to ‘just need a word.’ That’s why I’m asking instead of coming up.”

You slide your phone into your palm, angle your body toward the fire escape window. The glass there is beaded with rain; the metal frame sweats cold. From this angle you can catch a sliver of the alley—slick bricks, the fire escape ladder, and darkness pooling below.

You listen hard for a second set of steps.

Nothing above Kellan. Nothing behind him either—no double cadence, no whisper of fabric on drywall. But you do catch something else: a soft, almost inaudible *click* from the stairwell door at street level, like it was eased shut to keep the building quiet. Someone’s controlling sound, not making it.

Outside, the cruiser passenger’s cigarette ember blooms again, then dims. The driver’s face glows from a screen; the light shifts like scrolling text.

Kellan continues, giving you a thin slice of truth as bait. “You pulled a clip that doesn’t exist anymore. That means you tripped a Marrowline audit flag. My job is to make sure you stop tripping it… before someone higher up decides you’re a liability.” He lets that hang, then adds, “Also—your sister’s name is being used to launder something. You keep pulling footage, you’ll end up wearing it.”

The rain picks up, harder against the window. The building’s pipes tick once, loud in the quiet. Whatever’s happening, it’s happening now—while you’re half in a doorway with only a chain between you and a man who knows exactly what you touched.

**Status updates:**  
- Stairwell contact: identified as “Kellan” (claimed)  
- Street-level stairwell door: quietly secured  
- Marrowline cruiser: active monitoring  

```json
{"inventory_add":[],"inventory_remove":[],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":[],"npcs_add":[{"name":"Kellan (Marrowline Compliance)","description":"Claims to be Marrowline Compliance; positioned on the stairwell below your landing, calm and controlled; says the cruiser is 'visibility' and warns you tripped an audit flag."}]}

### Turn 14 [PLAYER]

“Compliance doesn’t show up at 2 a.m. without paperwork, Kellan. Slide your ID and a card under the door—then tell me one thing only you’d know about that audit flag.”  
Keeping the chain on, I ease back toward the fire escape window and quietly test if it’ll open, eyes on the alley while I listen for anyone moving at street level.

*Agent reasoning: Kellan’s offering a “warning” but they’ve already controlled the building’s exits; I need info without giving ground, and I should prepare an escape route while confirming whether this is a soft talk or a grab.*

### Turn 15 [GAME]

Kellan doesn’t answer right away. You hear him shift one step up—still below your landing, careful not to show himself in the door crack. Paper whispers against concrete.

Something slides under your door: a laminated Marrowline credential and a plain black business card. The lamination’s scuffed at the corners like it’s been flashed a lot. The name reads **Kellan Rusk**; the photo is him in a neutral gray backdrop, eyes dead-on. The card: **MARROWLINE // COMPLIANCE**, a direct number, no slogan.

“Audit flag,” he says, voice still calm, “is called a **WED-2311 divergence**. It’s not about *who* you are. It’s about the *shape* of the pull. Nine minutes of footage accessed through a deprecated municipal credential, from an endpoint that doesn’t belong to the city network. The system tags it as ‘legacy siphon’—and it pings Compliance because those pulls correlate with people who die inconveniently.” A beat. “That’s what only I’d know: the divergence label and the trigger profile. Nobody outside Marrowline calls it that.”

While he talks, you drift back toward the fire escape window on the west wall. Rain beads on the glass, neon from the street painting it sickly pink. You test the latch with two fingers, slow.

It gives—barely. The window sticks from old paint, but it *will* open if you commit to it. The frame creaks once, small but sharp in the quiet hall.

From the alley below: a faint scrape of rubber on wet brick, then the soft clink of metal—like a ladder rung being steadied or a fire escape joint taking weight. Not loud. Intentional.

Outside, the cruiser’s engine note changes—idle dips, then steadies—like the driver just got a message.

Kellan’s tone tightens a fraction. “If you’re thinking exit, don’t do it blind. There’s more than one way to leave this building, and Marrowline doesn’t always use the front door.”

**Status updates:**  
- Marrowline ID/card: under door  
- Fire escape window: latch opens, frame sticks  
- Alley: possible movement below  

```json
{"inventory_add":["Marrowline credential (Kellan Rusk)","Marrowline business card (Compliance direct line)"],"inventory_remove":[],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":[],"npcs_add":[]}```

### Turn 16 [PLAYER]

I crouch and quietly pocket the credential and card, then keep my voice steady at the door. “Kellan—tell your alley guy to freeze and step back into the light, or this conversation’s over.” I stay inside, chain on, and inch the fire escape window open just enough to peek down and scan for movement while I whisper into my phone to dial 911—finger hovering over call without hitting yet.

*Agent reasoning: There’s likely someone in the alley setting up the fire escape, so I shouldn’t bolt out blind. I need to control the conversation, confirm Kellan’s intent, and buy time while I assess exits and gather essentials.*

### Turn 17 [GAME]

Kellan goes still on the stairwell—so still you can hear the rainwork in the gutters outside.

“Alley guy?” he repeats, and there’s a hairline crack in the calm. “I didn’t bring an alley guy.”

You keep the chain on, stay inside, and ease the fire escape window open a few inches. Cold air needles your knuckles. From this west-facing slit you get a slice of the alley: wet brick, the black spine of the fire escape, trash bags shining like oil.

Movement: a figure tucked under the fire escape landing, half-hidden by shadow and a dripping downspout. Not Marrowline-uniform obvious—dark hood, workman’s jacket. They’re close enough you can see their shoulders rise as they breathe. One hand is on the fire escape ladder rail like they were testing weight; the other holds something long and narrow—could be a pry bar, could be a compact tool case.

As you speak your line—“freeze and step back into the light”—the figure doesn’t step out. They do something worse: they stop moving like they’ve been trained to vanish into stillness.

From the stairwell, Kellan lowers his voice. “Listen to me. If someone’s in your alley, it’s not Compliance. It’s either Patrol freelancing, or Union debt-collectors, or someone Calder hired who doesn’t care about cameras because they *own* the story afterward.” He swallows a beat. “Don’t open that window further. And don’t call 911 from that phone if you’ve been hitting street-cam archives—Marrowline tags emergency pings in flagged buildings. You’ll turn this into a beacon.”

Outside, the cruiser’s engine note bumps again. Headlights stay dark, but the dash glow brightens as if a screen just went full white.

Your thumb hovers over the 911 call. The alley figure shifts their grip on the ladder—metal ticks softly, and water shakes loose in a thin stream.

**Status updates**
- Alley: one concealed figure  
- Kellan: denies alley contact  
- Cruiser: monitoring intensifies  

```json
{"inventory_add":[],"inventory_remove":[],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":[],"npcs_add":[{"name":"Alley Figure (unknown)","description":"Concealed under the fire escape landing in the west alley; hooded, quiet, hand on ladder rail; holding a long narrow object (unclear if tool or weapon)."}]}```

### Turn 18 [PLAYER]

I ease the fire escape window shut until it’s just barely cracked, then lock it. “Kellan, if you’re not with him, prove you’re here to talk—back down the stairs where I can hear both your hands, and tell your cruiser to turn on its lights.” I text a trusted contact “Possible break-in, Harker office, Marrowline outside” with my phone held low, then grab my flashlight and sweep its beam through the blinds toward the alley-side fire escape shadows without opening anything further.

*Agent reasoning: Calling 911 might flag me, and opening the window invites the alley figure. I need to confirm Kellan’s intent, keep barriers up, and create noise/visibility to deter the alley approach while preparing a quieter exit or leverage.*

### Turn 19 [GAME]

The window settles back into its frame with a soft *thunk* and the lock bites. The crack you leave is hair-thin—enough for cold air, not enough for hands.

Your text goes out. No immediate reply.

You sweep the flashlight through the blinds toward the west alley. The beam stripes across rain-slick metal and brick, catching the fire escape’s underside—and for half a second it finds the hooded figure’s sleeve and knuckles on the ladder rail. They flinch back into the geometry of shadow like they’ve practiced disappearing. The long narrow object angles down out of sight.

In the stairwell, Kellan exhales like he’s deciding how much leverage to give you. Then you hear him do what you asked: slow steps *down* the stairs, deliberately loud, hands empty enough to sound like nothing but shoes and fabric.

“Good,” he says from lower down, keeping his voice pitched so it carries up to you. “Both hands are free. I’m here to talk.”

A beat—then his tone turns bitter. “Cruiser doesn’t take orders from me. Different division. Patrol answers to Operations, and Operations answers to whoever’s paying for ‘visibility’ tonight.” He pauses, listening toward street level. “But I can try.”

You hear him call down, not shouting—more like a coded professionalism. “Unit on Harker, this is Compliance Rusk. Light up. Now.”

Outside, the cruiser doesn’t flip full reds-and-blues. Instead, its parking lights come on—dim amber halos—followed by a brief, bright wash as the headlights flick on for a two-count and then drop back down. Not obedience. A warning. Or a signal.

Kellan catches it too. “That wasn’t for you,” he says quietly. “That was for *him*.”

In the alley, water starts dripping faster off the fire escape—vibrations traveling through the frame. The hidden figure has shifted position again, closer to the ladder’s base, staying out of your flashlight’s direct line.

**Status updates**
- Fire escape window: locked, minimal crack  
- Kellan: moved downstairs, hands free  
- Cruiser: brief headlight signal  
- Alley figure: repositioned, closer  

```json
{"inventory_add":["Text message sent to trusted contact (Possible break-in, Harker office, Marrowline outside)"],"inventory_remove":[],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":[],"npcs_add":[]}```

### Turn 20 [PLAYER]

Keeping my voice low, I call down the stairwell, “Kellan—if that signal wasn’t for me, tell me who ‘him’ is and what he wants, right now.” I back away from the window, kill my flashlight, and move to a position off-angle from both the blinds and the door while I quietly pull up 911 on my phone—ready to hit call if I hear glass or the fire escape start to give.

*Agent reasoning: I’m boxed in between a possible intruder at the fire escape and Marrowline “visibility” out front; I need confirmation, time, and a safer exit plan without escalating into a beacon.*

### Turn 21 [GAME]

Kellan doesn’t answer with a name. Not at first.

Immediate outcome: your move off-angle works—when the blinds faintly shift from air pressure, you’re no longer a clean silhouette behind them. The office goes darker as you kill the flashlight; only the street’s neon bleed and the thin seam under the door draw lines on the floor. Your phone screen glows in your palm with **911** queued, your thumb hovering.

Down the stairwell, Kellan speaks fast and low, like he’s afraid the concrete has ears. “*Him* is whoever’s using Patrol as a lantern. That headlight flash is a mark—‘target present, window side.’ It’s for the climber.”

You hear fabric rasp on the stairs as he leans on the rail. “What he wants? Not your wallet. Not your TV. He wants what you pulled: **MARROW//SENN//WED-2311**. The file name’s already in their chatter. If you accessed it, you’re the only person tonight who can prove the timeline was cut and re-stitched.”

Outside to the west, a soft metallic *clack* carries through the brick: the fire escape ladder being lifted a fraction and set back down—testing. Then a quieter sound, close to the window line: something hard touching metal, like a pry tip finding purchase. No glass breaks yet, but the frame gives a tiny complainting squeal.

From the front, under the door, a second shadow slides across the seam—someone shifting position in the hall or just past the stairwell entry. The cruiser remains out front with its dim ambers, idling steady, the kind of steady that says they’re not leaving.

Kellan adds, “If you call 911, don’t say ‘Marrowline.’ Say ‘unknown male on fire escape attempting entry.’ Keep it dumb. Keep it clean. And—Elias—don’t let them take you alive on camera.”

**Status updates**
- 911: ready to place call  
- Fire escape: pry pressure starting  
- Kellan: confirms “mark” signal  

```json
{"inventory_add":[],"inventory_remove":[],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":[],"npcs_add":[]}```

### Turn 22 [PLAYER]

I hit call on 911 and whisper, “This is Elias Vane at the Harker office—unknown male on the fire escape attempting entry, possible second person in the hall. Send units.”  
Then I call down, “Kellan, stay on the stairs and keep talking loud—tell me the address number and cross street like you’re confirming it for a report,” while I brace the window frame with my shoulder and grab the heaviest thing nearby to jam against the sill.

*Agent reasoning: Someone’s actively prying the fire escape while another presence shifts in the hall—this is turning into a forced entry on two fronts. Calling 911 with minimal detail creates a record and gets bodies moving without tipping “Marrowline.” I also need Kellan to act as a witness/blocker in the stairwell while I secure the weak point and prep an exit.*

### Turn 23 [GAME]

The call connects on the first ring—too fast, like the line was already listening.

“Nine-one-one, what’s your emergency?” The dispatcher’s voice is flat and trained; you keep yours down and clean. When you give **Harker office** and the break-in, there’s a faint pause—keys tapping—then: “Stay on the line. Units are being dispatched.”

To the west, the fire escape frame shudders under a careful, patient pressure. Rain ticks on metal like nails on a tin roof.

You plant your shoulder into the window frame and reach back without looking, grabbing the heaviest thing within arm’s sweep: the **steel two-drawer filing cabinet** beside your desk. It scrapes across the floor with a teeth-grinding screech. You muscle it into position and wedge its corner hard against the sill line, turning the window into a pinned joint instead of a hinge.

Outside, the pry squeal changes pitch—whoever’s there feels the resistance. There’s a frustrated *tap-tap* against the frame, then silence, the kind of silence that means repositioning.

Down the stairwell, Kellan gets the message and plays it like a report. He raises his voice a notch—still controlled, but loud enough to carry to the hall.

“Confirming: **214 Harker Avenue**, cross is **Larch and 9th**. Third-floor office. Reporting attempted forced entry via fire escape, possible second subject in interior hall.” He lets a beat hang, then adds, for whoever’s listening: “Compliance on scene. This is now a recorded incident.”

In the hall beyond your door, a soft shoe scuffs—someone shifting their weight, deciding whether Kellan’s volume is a bluff or a trap. Out front, the cruiser’s idle drops and rises once, like a driver touched the accelerator and thought better of it.

On the 911 line, the dispatcher’s tone tightens. “Sir, can you secure yourself away from windows and doors?” Then, quieter: “Do you see any identifying markings—uniforms, vehicles—anything?”

**Status updates**
- 911: connected, units “dispatched”
- Window: braced with filing cabinet
- Hall: second presence shifting
- Fire escape: pry paused, repositioning

```json
{"inventory_add":["911 call (active)"],"inventory_remove":[],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":[],"npcs_add":[]}
```

### Turn 24 [PLAYER]

Into the phone, low: “I’m away from the window now. No uniforms seen—there’s an unmarked cruiser idling out front with parking lights on; west-side fire escape suspect in dark clothing. I can’t safely get a plate.”  
I whisper down to Kellan, “Keep narrating—say you’re staying on with dispatch and that units are en route.” Then I ease up to the blinds just enough to peek for the cruiser’s make/model and any plate digits, keeping my body off to the side and ready to drop back.

*Agent reasoning: The 911 line feels compromised, so I’ll give only necessary details and avoid naming Marrowline. I need to reduce angles of attack, keep Kellan as a loud deterrent, and gather a quick visual on the cruiser without exposing myself.*

### Turn 25 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** You get enough of the cruiser to identify it—and you also draw a reaction.

On the 911 line, the dispatcher’s cadence shifts from bored to procedural. “Copy. Unmarked cruiser, parking lights. West-side fire escape suspect in dark clothing. Stay where you are. Units are en route.” There’s a beat. “Any weapons seen?”

You whisper to Kellan; he takes the cue and turns himself into a loud, boring liability. “Dispatch, I’m staying on the stairs, maintaining visual on the hall. Units advised en route to **214 Harker, Larch and 9th**.” He adds, pointedly, “I’ll keep this line open.”

You ease to the blinds—barely parting them with two fingers, body angled away so you’re not centered in the glass. Out front, rain makes the street a black mirror. The vehicle is a **Marrowline-style patrol sedan**—fleet silhouette even without decals: boxy rear, lightbar mount scar on the roofline, steelies. The plate is partially readable through the water and glare: **…7K3** at the end. The middle is a smear of white reflection.

As you focus, the cruiser’s driver-side door opens. A figure steps out and looks up—not at your window exactly, but at the building’s face like they know where eyes would be. At the same moment, to the west, metal complains: the fire escape ladder takes weight, rung by rung, slow and controlled. Whoever was testing is climbing again.

Kellan’s voice tightens in the stairwell. “Elias—hall shadow just moved. Someone’s listening closer now.”

The dispatcher repeats, “Sir—do you see a weapon?” and you catch, under her words, a faint second voice on the line—like an open-room echo, not quite feedback. Hard to tell if it’s your end or theirs.

**Status updates**
- Cruiser ID: Marrowline fleet type  
- Plate digits: ends in **7K3**  
- Fire escape: climbing resumed  
- Hall presence: closing distance  

```json
{"inventory_add":["Partial plate: …7K3","Vehicle ID: Marrowline fleet sedan (unmarked)"],"inventory_remove":[],"abilities_add":[],"locations_add":[],"npcs_add":[]}
```

### Turn 26 [PLAYER]

Into the phone, low: “No weapon seen yet—just a long narrow object, could be a pry bar. I have an unmarked Marrowline-style sedan out front, plate ends 7K3. Possible second suspect in the hallway.”

I step back from the blinds and whisper to Kellan, “Keep talking loud—say officers are two minutes out and you’re recording names.” Then I silently check the office door’s chain/lock and look for a second exit route (back stairwell, roof access, or adjacent window) without opening anything.

*Agent reasoning: Multiple threats are converging and the 911 line may be compromised; I need to reduce exposure, keep Kellan as a noisy deterrent, and prepare an exit or hard cover while giving dispatch only what’s necessary.*

### Turn 27 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** Dispatch acknowledges the plate digits, and your door is secure—for the moment. You also confirm there’s no clean second exit from inside the office without committing to a noisy move.

On the 911 line, the dispatcher’s voice firms up. “Copy: possible pry tool, unmarked sedan plate ending seven-kilo-three, second suspect in hallway. Stay inside, do not confront.” You hear her relaying it to units—your details go out over her shoulder like a flare.

You step back from the blinds into the office’s dim, the air smelling like wet wool and old paper. The filing cabinet you dragged is still jammed against the sill; the window frame ticks as someone on the fire escape tests it again—less prying now, more feeling for a weak point.

Kellan raises his voice like you asked, making a show of authority. “Officers are two minutes out. I’m recording names as we speak. If you’re in the hall, identify yourself.” He can’t actually see who’s there, but he sells it.

You silently check your office door: the **deadbolt is thrown**, the **knob lock is set**, and the **chain is in place**—but the chain plate is the cheap kind, two screws into old wood. It’ll slow a shove, not stop a determined shoulder.

You scan for an escape route without opening anything: the back wall is solid brick; no rear door. The ceiling access panel is painted shut and would take time and noise to force. The adjacent window faces the same fire escape line—no separate drop. You do spot one resource: the **transom window above your office door** (narrow, dusty glass) that opens inward with a latch—too small for you, but big enough to pass something through or see a sliver of the hall if you can reach it.

In the hall, the presence shifts closer—then stops. A low voice, not Kellan’s, murmurs something you can’t quite catch, like a radio whisper. Out front, the cruiser figure remains in the rain, head tilted up, waiting.

### Turn 28 [PLAYER]

I quietly drag my desk or a heavy chair to brace the office door under the handle, then step onto a chair to unlatch the transom just a crack and peek into the hall. Into the phone, low: “I may have visual through a transom—stand by,” then I whisper to Kellan, “If you see anyone, describe them out loud like it’s going on the record.”

*Agent reasoning: I need more info without exposing myself; the transom can give me eyes on the hall. The chain won’t hold long, so I should prepare a stronger barricade and keep dispatch updated while Kellan keeps pressure on the suspects.*

### Turn 29 [GAME]

You drag the **heavy chair** (the desk would scream across the floor) and wedge it under the door handle, pinning the knob so it can’t turn freely. The chair legs bite into the worn carpet; the door gives a tiny complaint as the pressure sets. Not unbreakable, but it turns a quick push into work.

Standing on your own chair, you ease the **transom latch** with two fingers. The metal is cold, gritty with old paint. You crack it a finger-width.

Through the slit: the hallway is a thin strip of yellow light and rain-shadow. Kellan is on the stair landing, half-turned, keeping his shoulders squared like a man with authority. Ten feet down the hall, near the corner by the payphone alcove, there’s a figure—**male silhouette, average height, dark jacket**, hood up. He’s not rushing. He’s posted like he’s holding a perimeter.

He’s got something in his right hand: long and narrow like you told dispatch—**pry bar or baton**, hard to tell at this angle. What you *can* tell is his left hand is up near his mouth, thumb pressed to a collar mic or cheap earpiece. He murmurs, and the words carry just enough: “—door’s chained. Window’s being worked.”

Kellan spots him at the same time and does exactly what you asked, loud and deliberate. “Male, average build, dark hooded jacket, holding a long tool—possible pry bar. You are being described on a recorded line. Identify yourself.” His voice rings down the stairwell.

The hooded man doesn’t flinch. He tilts his head, listening—then looks straight toward your office door, like he’s triangulating you through wood.

Outside, on the west-side fire escape, metal takes weight again—closer now, the faint rattle of a landing gate.

On the phone, dispatch cuts in: “Sir, do not expose yourself. Units are closing—stay on the line.”

### Turn 30 [PLAYER]

Into the phone, barely audible: “I have visual—male in hall, average height/build, dark hooded jacket, holding a long tool, using a mic/earpiece. He said, ‘door’s chained, window’s being worked.’”

I ease the transom shut and step off the chair, then whisper to Kellan, “Back up a flight if you can—don’t let him get hands on you. Keep talking like you’ve got his description and units are seconds out.”

I grab my coat and bag, move low to a spot off-angle from the window, and pick up the desk lamp to use as a blunt tool, listening for the next hit on the glass or the door.

*Agent reasoning: I’ve confirmed a coordinated entry from hall and fire escape; staying hidden and buying time is safer than confrontation. I should feed dispatch details, keep Kellan loud as deterrent, and prepare for the window/door to give while minimizing my exposure.*

### Turn 31 [GAME]

Your whispered update hits dispatch cleanly. You hear keys clacking, then the dispatcher—now fully alert—relays it verbatim to responding units: “Suspect confirms coordinated entry. Window being worked.” Her voice drops back to you: “Copy. Stay down and away from windows.”

You ease the transom shut; the latch kisses metal without a click. Off the chair, you pull your coat and bag close and slide low to the interior angle by the file cabinets—out of any straight line from the window or door. The desk lamp is heavier than it looks; the cord drags like a tail across the carpet.

In the hall, Kellan takes your advice. You hear his shoes retreat up a flight—quick but controlled—while he keeps his voice loud and official. “I’m stepping back for safety. Description remains the same. Units are seconds out. Sir, keep your hands visible.” He isn’t bluffing well enough to fool a pro, but he’s forcing the hooded man to make a choice: commit now or peel off.

The answer comes from two directions.

To the west, the fire escape gate gives a soft metallic *clack*, then the window frame shudders—one careful, testing hit, not a smash. Whoever’s out there is trying to defeat the frame quietly.

At your office door, the knob turns once—meets the chair brace—then stops. A pause. Something thin scrapes at the chain mount plate, probing for the screws. The cheap hardware whines like a toothache.

The hooded man’s voice carries, closer to the door now but still outside it, talking into his mic like you’re not there: “Hold. He’s got 911 open. Marrowline’s car’s out front—don’t spook it.” That tells you a lot: they know Marrowline’s presence matters, and they’re coordinating around it.

Outside, through rain-muted street noise, a distant siren rises—still blocks away, but coming.

### Turn 32 [PLAYER]

Into the phone, low: “They’re working the chain screws on my office door right now—quiet entry. Fire escape suspect is at the window, testing the frame. I’m staying low and armed with a lamp.”

I creep to the door’s hinge side and press my ear near the frame, then whisper, “Kellan, don’t come back down—stay up a flight and keep narrating. If you hear them start up the stairs, call it out.”

Keeping my body off the window line, I reach for something solid—my belt or a strap from my bag—and try to cinch the chair tighter against the knob/handle to keep it from shifting if they shove.

*Agent reasoning: They’re trying to defeat the chain screws quietly—if that plate gives, the door goes fast. I need to buy seconds, keep dispatch informed, and avoid a direct confrontation until units arrive.*

### Turn 33 [GAME]

Dispatch takes your whisper like a deposition. “Copy. Quiet entry on chain screws, suspect at fire escape window. Officers are two out—stay low.” You hear her push it out again, sharper this time, and a second voice acknowledges on the channel.

You slide to the **hinge side** of the office door—safer from a straight-through breach—and press your ear to the frame. The wood is cold, damp with the building’s sweat. Right on the other side: a thin metal *scritch-scritch* as a tool bites at the chain plate screws, followed by a careful pause like they’re listening for you to breathe.

You whisper to Kellan. From above, his reply comes down the stairwell, tense but steady: “Copy. I’m staying up. I’ve got eyes on the landing—if they move stairs, I’ll call it. Still narrating.” Then, louder for the hallway: “Units are en route. Suspect in dark hood, tool in hand, coordinated entry—this is being recorded.”

Keeping your body out of the window’s line, you hook your bag strap around the **chair and knob**, cinching it like a tourniquet. It works: the chair sucks tighter against the handle, and when the knob tests again, the brace doesn’t skate—it *holds*. The door still flexes under pressure, but now it’s fighting cord tension as well as furniture weight.

On the fire escape, the window frame gets another “quiet hit”—then a different sound: a thin wedge sliding, trying to spread the sash without shattering glass. Rain taps the pane in fast little nails, masking their finesse.

In the hall, the chain-screw work stops for half a beat. A low voice—hooded man, close—murmurs into his mic: “Door’s reinforced. Go window.” The coordination is real, and it’s adapting.

Somewhere outside, the Marrowline sedan’s engine note changes—idle to a brief rev—like the driver just woke up or got a message.

**Status updates**
- Door brace: strap-cinched, steadier  
- Chain screws: probing paused  
- Window: wedge attempt started

### Turn 34 [PLAYER]

Into the phone, low: “They’re switching to the window—using a wedge to spread the sash. Hall suspect just said ‘Go window.’”

I stay low and off the glass line, creep to the filing cabinet by the window, and quietly shove more weight against the window frame from inside (cabinet/desk edge) to resist the spread without getting silhouetted. Then I whisper to Kellan, “They’re committing to the window—if you hear glass or the fire escape gate, call it,” and I grip the lamp with both hands, ready to swing if the sash pops.

*Agent reasoning: They’ve shifted to the window, which is my weakest point. I need to buy seconds without exposing myself, keep dispatch updated, and avoid a direct fight unless they breach.*

### Turn 35 [GAME]

Your whisper to dispatch goes through; you hear the dispatcher’s tone harden as she repeats it to units: “Suspects shifting to window entry—wedge in use. Occupant staying low.”

You crawl to the **filing cabinet by the west window**, keeping your head below sill height. The cabinet’s metal is cold and gritty under your palms. You get your shoulder into it and shove—slow, controlled, no scrape if you can help it—until the cabinet kisses the wall and **pins the lower window frame from the inside**.

Immediate effect: the wedge pressure outside meets resistance. The sash gives a tiny, angry *creak*… then stops moving. Whoever’s on the fire escape tries again—harder—and the whole window trembles, but it doesn’t spread. Not yet.

Outside, you catch a shadow shift across the rain-streaked glass—someone repositioning their feet on the grate. A second tool taps the frame, testing for a weaker point. The rain and traffic hiss make it hard to place, but the rhythm is patient: they’re not panicking, they’re working.

You whisper up to Kellan. From the stairwell above: “Copy. Listening. If they break glass or hit the gate, I’ll call it—” Then, quieter, just for you: “Elias… I heard him say ‘Marrowline won’t want bodies.’ That means they might take you alive.”

In the hall, the hooded man’s voice comes faint through the door now, talking into his mic: “He braced it. Try the latch side—don’t crack it unless you have to.” Then his footsteps retreat a few paces, like he’s giving the window man room.

Down on the street, that Marrowline sedan’s engine turns over again, and headlights sweep across your frosted office glass—somebody’s shifting position to watch the fire escape line.

You tighten your grip on the lamp with both hands. The cord wraps your wrist once by accident, a poor man’s lanyard. The window gives another strain-noise—wood and metal protesting—followed by a brief pause like the climber is reassessing.

### Turn 36 [PLAYER]

Into the phone, low: “Window’s braced from inside but they’re probing the latch side—still attempting a quiet entry. I’m staying low.”

I unwrap the lamp cord from my wrist and set my bag strap within reach like a restraint, then slide a few feet deeper off-angle from the window and door, keeping the lamp ready but not raised. I whisper up to Kellan, “If they try to come through, yell that units are at the door—sell it,” then I listen for the fire escape gate or a latch pop.

*Agent reasoning: They’re trying for a quiet window entry and may want me alive; I should buy time for police, avoid silhouette, and prepare a non-lethal response while keeping dispatch updated.*

### Turn 37 [GAME]

Dispatch copies your update; you hear her push it to responding units with the kind of clipped calm that means they’re close. “Window entry in progress, latch side being probed. Occupant low, armed with improvised weapon.”

You unwrap the lamp cord from your wrist—no more accidental tether—and set the bag strap open on the carpet within a hand’s reach, like a piece of kit instead of a trip hazard. Then you slide deeper into the room, off-angle from both the door and the west window. From here, the window is to your left, the door to your right; you’re tucked where neither has a clean line on your chest.

The building gives you one sharp, telling sound: a soft *metallic tick* at the window latch—too crisp to be settling wood. A second later, the sash exhales a hairline *creeeak* as the wedge bites again. Your cabinet brace holds, but the latch side is being worried like a loose tooth.

Up the stairwell, Kellan answers your whisper without coming closer. “Got it.” Then he raises his voice, projecting down the hall like he’s talking to an approaching squad: “Units are at the front door—right now. Don’t move. Hands where I can see them.” He’s selling it hard.

The effect is immediate on the other side of the glass: the pressure stops. Footsteps on the fire escape grate shift—one quick step back, then stillness. A low voice, muffled by rain and pane, hisses something you can’t make out, but the cadence is irritated.

From the hallway side, you catch the hooded man’s response through the door—closer to a mutter than a command: “He’s bluffing. Keep it quiet.” Another pause. “Marrowline car’s repositioning—move.”

Outside, headlights sweep again—closer, lower angle—painting watery stripes across your office wall. Whoever’s in that Marrowline sedan is actively watching the fire escape line now, not just idling.

Somewhere down on the street, the real siren dopplers louder, then cuts briefly as if they’re turning onto Harker.

### Turn 38 [PLAYER]

Into the phone, barely audible: “They paused at the window after my associate bluffed units at the front—hall suspect says it’s a bluff. Marrowline car repositioning and watching the fire escape.”

I whisper to Kellan, “Keep selling it—say you can hear sirens at the curb and units are coming up now. Don’t come down.” Then I crawl closer to the floor by the hinge side again and listen hard for footsteps leaving the fire escape or the hall, keeping the lamp low and ready.

*Agent reasoning: They’re hesitating but not gone; I need to buy seconds until police arrive, keep myself out of lines of fire, and get better intel without exposing Kellan or myself. Creating the impression of imminent police entry may force a retreat, while I listen for movement at the window/door and the fire escape.*

### Turn 39 [GAME]

Your update to dispatch lands; you hear the operator relaying it, and then—new—an actual unit voice cuts in over the line for half a second: “We’re two blocks. Keep him on the floor.” Not a bluff anymore.

You whisper to Kellan and he commits to the lie like it’s a warrant. From above, loud enough to carry down the stairwell: “Yeah—sirens at the curb. They’re coming up now. Don’t make me say it twice.” Then, under his breath, aimed only at you: “I can’t see the hall from here anymore. Someone moved.”

You crawl back to the **hinge side** of your office door, cheek near the baseboard. The air down here tastes like dust and wet wool from your coat. The filing cabinet still pins the window frame to the west; the door is a dark slab to your right.

Listening hard pays off—two different departures, two different tempos:

From the **fire escape**, the grate gives a careful *clank… clank* as weight shifts away from the window, followed by the faint rattle of the gate latch being tested, then released. Whoever was working the sash is backing off without committing to the gate.

In the **hallway**, you catch soft shoe rubber moving away—then stopping. A voice you haven’t heard before, lower and closer to the door than the hooded man, murmurs: “Sedan’s got eyes. If cops hit the lobby, we’re out.” The hooded man answers, tight: “We’re not empty-handed.” A pause. “Chain plate—rip it. Fast.”

The chain plate on your door jolts—no more delicate screw work. A hard yank; the wood around the screws groans. Your strap-and-chair brace holds the knob, but the **chain mount** is now the weak point, and they’ve decided noise is acceptable.

Outside, the Marrowline sedan’s headlights wash across the window again, steadier this time, like the driver’s stopped and is just watching the fire escape and your floor-level silhouette possibilities.

The real siren swells, close enough now that it vibrates in the glass. Time pressure tightens: if the intruders commit to a loud breach, you’ll have seconds of chaos before uniforms arrive—and Marrowline watching means someone’s ready to spin whatever happens next.

### Turn 40 [PLAYER]

Into the phone, low: “They’re forcing the chain plate—going loud at my office door. I’m on the floor hinge side, armed with a lamp. Officers are two blocks—please hurry.”

I crawl backward to deeper cover behind the desk, keeping my body off the door’s swing line, and set the lamp head-up like a club. I whisper to Kellan, “They’re ripping the chain—don’t come down; if you can, get eyes on the stairwell and tell units which floor,” then I go silent and listen for the plate tearing free or footsteps rushing in.

*Agent reasoning: They’ve switched to a loud breach on the chain plate—if it gives, I need distance and a better angle, not a grapple in the doorway. Cops are close, so I should buy seconds, keep dispatch updated, and avoid being silhouetted by the window or caught in the door swing.*

### Turn 41 [GAME]

Your whisper into the phone gets a hard confirmation from dispatch—closer than before, a male officer cutting in again: “Copy forced entry. Stay behind cover. We’re pulling up.” Tires hiss somewhere outside, not just sirens now—actual arrival.

You crab-walk backward behind your desk, keeping clear of the door’s swing and the straight lane from the hall. The carpet under the desk is littered with a few paperclips and old grit; your knee knocks the underside once—dull thud, swallowed by the building’s noise. You set the lamp head-up in both hands like a short club, elbows tight.

Then the chain plate gives.

Not all at once—first a dry *crack* as the top screw tears a crescent of wood free, then a violent *RRIP* that drags the plate sideways. The chain snaps taut, buys you a heartbeat, and then the remaining screws pop with two sharp *tacks* like nails pulled from a coffin.

The door swings inward partway and bounces against your strap brace—enough gap for a shoulder and a forearm, not enough for a full rush. A hand shoots through holding something flat and dark—a pry bar or a slim jim—jabbing down toward the strap like they’re trying to cut or hook it.

In the hall, the hooded man’s voice is right there now, breathy with effort: “Get it—get it—” The deeper second voice answers, colder: “Cops are here. Two minutes, tops.”

Up the stairwell, Kellan whispers, strained: “I’ve got eyes—third floor landing, outside your suite. I can hear them at your door.” Then he raises his voice, selling to the building: “Third floor! They’re on the third—move!”

Outside the west window, the Marrowline sedan’s headlights dim for a second—like the driver just killed them—then the engine revs and the car rolls, repositioning again. Whoever’s watching doesn’t want to be seen when uniforms hit the curb.

### Turn 42 [PLAYER]

I stay low behind the desk and smash the lamp down onto the arm/tool jabbing at the strap, aiming for wrist and knuckles. Then I bark toward the hall, “Cops are in the lobby—leave now!” and immediately go quiet again, listening for them to retreat or try a second push.

*Agent reasoning: They can reach through the gap to cut the strap, so I need to stop their hand without exposing myself; police are arriving so stalling a few seconds matters more than chasing.*

### Turn 43 [GAME]

The lamp comes down hard through the gap—ceramic base first—catching the intruder’s wrist and the back of his knuckles as the tool hooks at the strap. The impact lands solid. You feel the jolt up your forearms; you hear a wet *crack* and a sharp inhale that turns into a yelp.

The tool clatters into your office and skitters across the floor toward the desk leg. The hand recoils out of the gap, fingers curling wrong for a second before they disappear into the hall.

Behind the desk, low and tight to the carpet, you bark, “Cops are in the lobby—leave now!” Your voice comes out harsher than you meant, and it carries.

In the hallway: a half-second of dead air—then the deeper voice snaps, urgent. “He’s got us timed. Move.” The hooded man spits back, “We’re not leaving the—” but he cuts off as the building fills with a new sound: boots taking the stairs fast, two at a time, echoing up the stairwell.

Kellan, somewhere above and to the east, adds fuel to the panic in a stage whisper that’s meant to be overheard: “They’re coming up—now.”

The door gap flexes as someone shoulders it once—testing—then releases. You hear retreating footsteps, not running yet, but quick and controlled, fading down the hall toward the stairwell. On the fire escape side, the grate rattles faintly again—someone shifting position, deciding whether to drop or stay put now that uniforms are in the building.

Rain ticks the west window like thrown sand. Your office smells like hot dust off the lamp and fresh-splintered wood from the torn chain plate. The strap brace is still holding, but it’s been worried and tugged—fibers whining softly under tension.

### Turn 44 [PLAYER]

I keep low behind the desk, grab the dropped pry tool with a sleeve over my hand, and tuck it into an evidence envelope from my bag. Then I whisper into the phone, “Suspects retreating toward stairwell—third floor hall,” and call out, “Officers, I’m inside—door’s compromised, don’t force it blind; announce at Suite 3B.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re retreating and police are close; I don’t want to chase into an ambush. I should secure the room, preserve evidence, and guide responding officers to the right door while watching the window/fire escape.*

### Turn 45 [GAME]

You keep your profile flat behind the desk, the carpet cold against your forearms. Through the half-open door, the hallway light spills in a thin wedge, catching dust motes and the splintered crescent where the chain plate used to bite.

You hook your sleeve over your hand, pinch the dropped pry tool by its middle, and slide it into an evidence envelope from your bag without leaving prints. Metal-on-paper makes a soft scrape; you fold the flap and press it shut with your thumb through the sleeve. Whatever they were doing at your strap, you’ve got the instrument now—unmarked, but it’ll carry trace and maybe toolmarks if anyone bothered with gloves and got sloppy.

Into the phone, you whisper: “Suspects retreating toward stairwell—third floor hall.” Dispatch doesn’t waste breath; the officer on-scene answers tight: “Copy. Third floor. Hold position.”

Then you call out toward the hall: “Officers, I’m inside—door’s compromised, don’t force it blind; announce at Suite 3B.”

Boots hit your landing—heavy, deliberate now, not sprinting. A voice you don’t recognize barks, professional and loud: “Police! Third floor! Suite 3B—announce yourself!” Another officer answers from a step below, “Hallway clear to the bend.” Their flashlights rake the corridor, beams sliding across your door gap.

Down the hall, you catch the retreating pair for only a moment—shadows cutting across the far wall—then the stairwell door bangs once, hard, as someone shoves through it. Almost immediately, there’s a second metallic rattle from the *fire escape* side: whoever backed off your window is moving again, faster now, using the police arrival as cover to disappear.

Kellan’s voice comes faint from above, breathy with relief and adrenaline: “They’re past me—going down. I’m staying put.”

### Turn 46 [PLAYER]

Keeping my hands visible and my voice steady, I call out, “Elias Vane, private investigator—alone inside Suite 3B. Door chain plate is ripped out; I’m behind the desk. I’m coming into view slowly.”

I set the lamp down, stay low, and angle so the officers can see me through the gap; then I add, “One more suspect may be on the west fire escape—metal rattle just now. Window’s braced but check the exterior.”

*Agent reasoning: Police are finally here, but my door is compromised and someone may still be on the fire escape. I need to identify myself clearly, keep officers from mistaking me for a suspect, and warn them about the window/fire escape exit while preserving evidence.*

### Turn 47 [GAME]

“Elias Vane, private investigator—alone inside Suite 3B. Door chain plate is ripped out; I’m behind the desk. I’m coming into view slowly.”

Immediate outcome: it works. The officers don’t kick, don’t rush. The flashlight beams stop jittering and settle, controlled—trained hands. A voice answers from the hallway, close to your door but off the hinge line: “Copy, Vane. Keep your hands up where we can see them. Don’t move toward the doorway.”

You set the lamp down; it clicks against the floor, and the smell of hot dust fades under the sharper odor of wet wool and rain as the hall air pushes in through the gap. Staying low, you angle so your hands and face appear in the slice of light.

“Good,” the officer says. “You injured?”

“Not me,” you answer, and add, “One more suspect may be on the west fire escape—metal rattle just now. Window’s braced but check the exterior.”

The second officer, a woman by the voice—calm, clipped—keys her radio immediately: “Unit to exterior, west side fire escape—possible subject moving. Check from alley and roof access.” Then, to you, quieter: “We had a Marrowline sedan drop off our tail at the curb and kill lights. You say ‘fire escape,’ I believe you.”

In the stairwell, boots thunder downward—someone on the police team committing to the chase. At the same time, from outside your west window you catch a faint scrape—metal on metal—followed by a soft *thump* lower than your floor, like someone dropping a rung or hopping a landing.

The hallway officer leans just enough to see your face clearly through the gap. “Mr. Vane, we’re going to make entry safe. That strap brace—keep it. We’ll take the door from the hinges if we have to. You have any weapons on you?”

Kellan’s whisper comes through your phone again, barely audible under radio chatter: “They’re going down hard. I heard one of them say ‘Union’—I don’t know if it’s a bluff or who they’re calling.”

**Status updates**
- Police: holding at Suite 3B

### Turn 48 [PLAYER]

Hands up, I call through the gap, “No firearms—just a heavy desk lamp on the floor. I do have an evidence envelope with a pry tool they dropped; I can set it in plain view if you tell me where.”  

Into the phone, barely moving my lips, “Kellan—stay put and keep listening; don’t chase.” Then to the officers, “One of them said ‘Union’ while retreating—could be a rendezvous or a crew name. Also, Marrowline sedan killed lights outside—watch for it circling.”

*Agent reasoning: I need to keep officers calm and informed, avoid sudden moves, and preserve evidence. Also “Union” might be a location or crew name—worth relaying without speculating.*

### Turn 49 [GAME]

“Copy: no firearms,” the hallway officer calls back, voice still off to the hinge side. **Immediate outcome:** they treat you like a cooperative witness, not a threat—no forced entry, no shouted contradictions. “Set the envelope on the floor and slide it toward the gap. Slow. Keep your hands visible the whole time.”

You ease the sealed evidence envelope down beside the lamp, then push it forward with two fingers until it kisses the thin line of hallway light. The paper rasps over grit; the air near the door smells like wet asphalt and someone’s cheap cologne, close enough to mean one of them was right there a minute ago.

The female officer answers your intelligence as she radios it in, not dismissive—measuring. “Heard ‘Union,’ possible Gilt Hand involvement. Marrowline sedan dark-out, possible counter-surveillance. Advise units: watch for unmarked fleet, partial plate ends 7K3.” A beat later she adds, to you, “You keep notes like a pro, Vane. Stay put.”

On your phone, Kellan’s whisper comes back, thin and shaking but obedient: “Staying. I’m at the stairwell landing above. I can hear… someone downstairs arguing with a cop—like they’re trying to *talk* their way past.”

Outside, from the west, there’s a sharp call from an exterior unit—muffled through glass and rain: “Movement on the fire escape—subject dropping!” Then a metallic clatter runs down the ladder like thrown coins, followed by a car door slam in the alley and an engine coughing to life.

In the hall, an officer’s boot nudges your envelope into their light. “Got it,” he says. “We’re going to secure the door and get you out clean. Don’t touch anything else.”

**Status updates**
- Evidence envelope: surrendered to police  
- Exterior unit: fire escape contact  
- Alley: vehicle started, leaving  
- Kellan: holding position, listening

### Turn 50 [PLAYER]

I keep my hands up and say, “Understood—staying still. If that vehicle just peeled out of the west alley, get its direction—toward Mercer or back to Harbor?”  

Into the phone, barely audible, “Kellan, stay on that landing and don’t engage—just tell me if anyone comes back up.”  

Then to the officers, “If you’re extracting me, I’ll follow commands exactly—tell me when to stand and where you want me facing.”

*Agent reasoning: Police are taking control; safest is to comply, preserve the scene, and get actionable info to them—especially the fleeing vehicle and “Union.” Also need to keep Kellan safe and document details without contaminating evidence.*

### Turn 51 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** the officers take your lead and treat you like a cooperative asset. The woman in the hall keys her mic the second you ask about direction. “West alley runner—confirm direction of travel. Mercer or Harbor.”

Rain hisses against your west window; the braced frame trembles once as the building settles, and the hallway light through the door gap is chopped by moving legs and swinging flashlights.

A voice cracks back over the radio, breathless with wind: “Vehicle exited west alley **northbound toward Mercer**, dark sedan, no headlights for the first block—lost at the Mercer cut-through.” The hallway officer mutters, half to himself: “That’s discipline. That’s not a kid running.”

You whisper to the phone, barely moving your lips. “Kellan, stay on that landing and don’t engage—just tell me if anyone comes back up.”

Kellan answers immediately, hushed: “Copy. I hear… wait—yeah, someone downstairs is talking fast. Sounds like they’re trying to convince the cops they belong here. If they come up, I’ll breathe once into the phone.”

In the hall, the male officer shifts closer to the doorframe but keeps his body off the fatal funnel. “Alright, Vane. Stand up slow. Face the back wall first—hands high. Then turn toward the door when I tell you. We’re going to open you up enough to get you out without you stepping into broken glass.”

Another unit in the stairwell radios in, frustrated: “Subject gone. Fire escape ladder was used—alley pickup confirmed.” The woman officer’s tone hardens: “Marrowline sedan dark-out and a ‘Union’ mention—this is getting shared with detectives. You’re not just a burglary victim tonight.”

### Turn 52 [PLAYER]

I stand up slowly and face the back wall with my hands high. “Facing back wall—hands up. Tell me when to turn.”  

Without turning my head, I say, “Officer—before I move, is Kellan Marrow accounted for? He’s in the building and I don’t want him mistaken for a suspect.”  

Into the phone, barely audible: “Kellan, freeze where you are—if officers reach you, announce yourself loud and keep hands visible.”

*Agent reasoning: I want out safely without spooking anyone; I’ll comply precisely, but keep gathering details and make sure Kellan stays safe.*

### Turn 53 [GAME]

**Immediate outcome:** your compliance buys you control of the room. No one rushes you. The hallway officer answers you like you’re part of the scene, not the problem.

“Good,” the male officer says. “Hold that position. Don’t turn yet.” His flashlight beam crawls across the back wall in front of you, then steadies—he’s sighting angles, making sure nobody’s tucked behind your filing cabinet.

To your left, the west window frame gives a soft *tick* as rain cools the metal; somewhere below, an engine note fades into the wet city noise.

At your mention of Kellan, the female officer’s tone shifts—professional caution. “Kellan *Marrow*? Describe him. Clothes. Height. Anything in his hands. We’ve got multiple units in this building and nobody’s cleared as ‘friendly’ unless dispatch says so.”

She keys her radio: “All units: possible civilian male named Kellan Marrow in building—do not mistake for suspect. Request location and description.” There’s a beat of radio hiss, then a stairwell unit answers: “We’ve got a male on the upper landing—hands visible, not running. Says he’s ‘Kellan.’ We’re holding him.”

On your phone, you whisper your warning. Kellan’s reply comes back immediate and loud enough to hear the fear under the control: “Copy. I’m frozen. They’re here—flashlight on me.”

From the hall, the male officer says, “Alright, Vane. On my count: turn your head only—look at the door. Keep hands high. We’re going to open it, and you’re coming out sideways.”

A different voice—older, irritated—cuts in from the stairwell radio: “Marrowline patrol is outside trying to ‘assist.’ They’re asking names.” The female officer answers flatly: “They can wait at the curb. This is ours.”

### Turn 54 [PLAYER]

I keep my hands high and only turn my head toward the door like instructed. “Kellan Marrow is mid-20s, slim, dark hoodie and jeans, no weapon—likely on his phone; he’ll comply if you tell him to.”  

As I wait for the count, I add, “Who’s the scene lead here? I need a name for my statement—and I want to flag ‘Union’ plus that dark Marrowline sedan for your detectives.”

*Agent reasoning: I want out without getting mistaken for a threat, but I also need to lock in details about “Union” and the Marrowline involvement before the scene goes cold. I’ll comply with extraction while quietly giving the officers a quick description of Kellan and asking who’s in charge so I know who to follow up with.*

### Turn 55 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** your description gets repeated over the radio, and Kellan stops being “unknown male” and becomes “cooperative witness.” The tension in the stairwell eases—no one tackles him, no cuffs tighten.

The hallway officer says, “Received,” and relays it clean: “Upper landing male: mid-20s, slim, dark hoodie, jeans, phone only—compliant.” Over the radio, the stairwell unit answers, “Copy. He’s staying still. We’ve got him seated, hands visible.”

Your head is turned toward the door; you can see the thin blade of light at the threshold widen and shrink as someone tests the chain. The air coming through the crack is cold and wet, carrying the smell of stairwell concrete and a whiff of ozone from a cheap stun baton being palmed somewhere out of sight.

“You want a name?” the female officer says. “Officer Drea Mott. I’m acting lead until Sergeant Pritchard gets eyes on it.” Like it matters, she adds, “And you’ll get a case number.”

When you flag the Union and the dark sedan, Mott doesn’t argue—she tightens up. “Say it without the colorful nouns,” she warns, low. “Walls carry sound.” Then, into her mic: “Detectives: note possible third-party fence network involvement and unmarked Marrowline-type fleet sedan, dark-out, fled north toward Mercer cut-through. Request canvass for camera anomalies along Mercer.”

In the background, the older sergeant’s voice hits the radio again: “Pritchard on scene. Marrowline patrol outside wants to ‘coordinate.’” Mott answers, clipped: “Tell them to wait. Nobody gets names off my hallway.”

The male officer at your door finally gives it: “Count of three. One… two…” The chain rattles; the latch starts to slide.

### Turn 56 [PLAYER]

On “three,” I move exactly as instructed—sideways through the opening, hands still high, eyes on the officers’ cues. “Officer Mott—once I’m clear, I want the case number and I’d like my statement taken away from the hallway. Also: please keep Marrowline patrol from getting my name or Kellan’s—where are you staging him?”

*Agent reasoning: I want out safely without triggering a bad reaction, but I also need to lock in the case number and make sure Marrowline doesn’t get my name or Kellan’s. I’ll comply with extraction, then ask Mott quietly about where they’re staging Kellan and how to keep statements controlled.*

### Turn 57 [GAME]

You slide out on “three” exactly the way they want—sideways, hands high. The male officer catches your elbow with two fingers, guides you clear of the jamb, then angles you against the hallway wall so you’re not in line with your own doorway. No cuffs. No shove. Just control.

The hall smells like wet wool and old paint; to the east, the stairwell door stands half-open, spilling a harsher fluorescent light and the echo of radio chatter. Behind you, your office door hangs on its brace, chain still trembling from being worked.

Officer Mott steps into your sightline, not close enough to crowd you. “Good. Keep your hands up until I say.” She nods once at your request. “Statement’s not happening in the hallway. Too many ears.” Then, quieter: “Marrowline doesn’t get your names from me. But if they’re listening to our radios, that’s not my switch to flip.”

She keys her mic: “Pritchard—stage Vane and the other civilian away from the front. I want them off the stairwell line.” A beat later, the older sergeant’s voice returns, closer now, not just in the radio—boots on the landing. “I’m here. Mott, move them to the second-floor laundry room. Door closes. No windows.”

Mott looks back to you. “Case number comes from dispatch once it’s generated. You’ll get it before we leave.” Her eyes cut toward the stairwell. “Kellan is staged **upper landing, now moving down under escort** to the laundry room. He’s not going outside. Marrowline can stare at the curb all night.”

Downstairs, through the stairwell gap, a new voice carries up—smooth, too rehearsed: “Marrowline Compliance. We’re here to protect our asset and secure the premises.” Pritchard answers without heat, which is worse. “You’re here to wait.”

Mott finally lowers her hand a few inches, signaling you can drop your arms to shoulder height. “Slow. Follow my light. Don’t talk loud.”

### Turn 58 [PLAYER]

I follow Mott’s light toward the second-floor laundry room, keeping my hands where they can see them and my voice low. “Sergeant Pritchard—thank you. Once we’re behind that door, I’ll give you the full ‘Union’ context and anything I caught about the Marrowline sedan—no hallway acoustics.”

As soon as I spot Kellan under escort, I keep my tone calm: “Kellan—eyes forward, hands visible. You’re good.” Then, to Mott, “Any chance you can have dispatch keep our names off the radio traffic going forward?”

*Agent reasoning: We’re exposed in the hallway and Marrowline is sniffing around; best move is to comply, get into the closed staging room, and quietly coordinate with Kellan while giving police the key intel without broadcasting it.*

### Turn 59 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Mott gets you and Kellan moved off the stairwell line without incident, and your “keep names off the air” request lands—partially. They can clamp down going forward, but they can’t un-say what’s already been said in earshot.

Mott’s flashlight leads you down the second-floor corridor. The building hums with old wiring; the air changes near the laundry room—warm lint, detergent, and damp plaster. The door is a dented steel slab with a push-bar, paint worn to bare metal where a thousand tenants have shouldered through.

Kellan comes into view at the landing—hood up, phone in his hand like a stress ball, flanked by the stairwell unit. He snaps his eyes toward you, then obeys your calm correction and stares at the wall instead. The escorting officer murmurs, almost surprised, “He’s listening.”

Sergeant Pritchard appears in the corridor mouth, broad-shouldered, rain still beading on his cap brim like he walked through a storm to get here. “Appreciate the discretion,” he says, and it’s not warmth—more like a transaction. “Behind the door, you give me names, places, and how you know it. If you’re wrong, you’re wasting my night. If you’re right, you just bought yourself a problem with people who don’t file complaints.”

Down the stairs, the Marrowline Compliance rep’s voice still floats up in fragments—“liability,” “premises,” “client safety”—trying to sound like they own the building. Pritchard doesn’t look down. He just radios once: “Keep them at the curb. No entry.”

Mott answers your dispatch question while palming her shoulder mic. “We can go ‘two civilians’ from here on out. Dispatch can scrub names from broadcast traffic if we ask—doesn’t stop a scanner from catching what’s already out.” She keys in: “Dispatch, from Mott—limit identifiers on air. Refer to witnesses as ‘Vane’ and ‘Marrow’ only if necessary; no full names.”

A tinny reply crackles back: “Copy. Minimal identifiers.”

The laundry room door opens. Inside: rattling dryers, a folding table, a utility sink with a rust halo, and—most important—thick walls that eat sound.

- Staging: moved to laundry room

### Turn 60 [PLAYER]

I step fully into the laundry room and angle myself so I can see the door and the hallway crack. “Sergeant—here’s the clean version: I heard the word ‘Union’ used like an identifier, not a generic term, and the runner had a dark sedan pickup that moved like a fleet car—dark-out, no headlights, north toward Mercer cut-through.”

I glance at Kellan. “Kellan, just confirm what you heard downstairs—only the words you’re sure of.” Then back to Pritchard: “Before we go further—are we free to leave after statements, or do you want us held as witnesses? And what exactly is Marrowline claiming outside—‘asset’ meaning who?”

*Agent reasoning: We’re finally in a quieter, controlled space—time to give Pritchard the key facts, but carefully and in a way that protects Kellan and me. I also want to learn what Marrowline’s angle is and whether we’re safe to leave after statements.*

### Turn 61 [GAME]

Pritchard takes your “clean version” without interrupting, then looks past you at the door like he’s measuring how much sound gets through steel. “That’s usable,” he says. “Mercer cut-through narrows our search grid.”

The laundry room is warm and loud in a dull way—dryer drums thumping somewhere behind a row of stacked machines, the stink of detergent and wet lint hanging in the air. You’ve got a sightline: door seam, hallway sliver, and the push-bar within arm’s reach if it goes bad.

Kellan swallows, keeps his eyes where you told him. “I heard… ‘Union’—like, *the Union*,” he says carefully. “And ‘pawnshop debts don’t die’—that part, I’m sure. Then something about ‘ledger in play.’ I didn’t see faces. Just—hood, and a handoff vibe.”

Pritchard’s eyebrows lift a millimeter at *ledger*. He doesn’t comment on it, but he clocks it.

On your questions, he answers like a man who’s had too many civilians try to lawyer their way into safety: “You’re not under arrest. You’re witnesses. You’re free to leave after statements **unless** Marrowline makes a credible claim you’re in immediate danger or there’s an active warrant that pops when we run you. I’m not holding you for their convenience.”

Mott, standing near the utility sink, keys her shoulder mic and keeps it low. Dispatch crackles back faintly: “Marrowline requesting contact with witness V—” Mott cuts in, sharp: “Negative. Through sergeant only.”

Pritchard finally addresses the “asset” line. “Marrowline says the ‘asset’ is their credential—Rusk. They’re claiming he’s a contracted operator and that you’re in possession of company property and ‘sensitive access.’ They want him and anything he gave you. They also keep saying they need to ‘secure the scene’ because your office is tied into their camera node.” He lets that hang. “They don’t get to run my scene.”

As he speaks, you hear it through the wall: the faint rhythm of a radio outside, and the heavier pause of someone who’s stopped pacing—like they’ve decided waiting isn’t enough.

- Marrowline claim: “Rusk credential” asset

### Turn 62 [PLAYER]

I nod once. “Understood—Rusk credential, ‘company property,’ and a claimed camera node. Sergeant, before I add more: are you treating my office as a potential crime scene search, and if so, are you seeking a warrant or consent? I’m not consenting to a Marrowline fishing expedition.”

I glance at Kellan. “Good job—stick to what you’re sure of. Say nothing about guesses.”

Back to Pritchard, voice low. “I want a safe exit plan after we finish—escort to a rideshare pickup away from the curb, and keep Marrowline from approaching either of us. And please get that case number as soon as dispatch generates it.”

*Agent reasoning: Marrowline is trying to frame this as “company property/sensitive access,” which could turn into pressure or a search. I need to keep Kellan calm, get a case number, and control what info I give—enough to help police, not enough to hand Marrowline leverage. Also I want to know if my office is about to be searched and whether they can escort us out safely.*

### Turn 63 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Pritchard accepts your boundary—no consent, no Marrowline access—and shifts the scene to “witness handling,” not “search.” He also starts building you an exit that doesn’t funnel you past Marrowline at the curb, but he can’t promise they won’t try a last-second contact.

The laundry room’s dryer thump makes a steady pulse under the conversation; through the door seam you catch a slice of hallway light and the shadow of an officer posted outside, planted like a doorstop.

Pritchard holds your gaze. “Good. You’re doing it right.” He taps his notebook once. “Right now, your office is a **potential** crime scene because of the attempted entry and the 911. That means *we* decide who goes in. I’m not searching without a reason I can articulate, and I’m not letting Marrowline ‘secure’ anything. If I need inside, I’ll ask you for consent. If you say no, I either walk away or I go warrant. That’s the line.”

Mott’s radio chirps; she turns her shoulder away, listening. A second later her eyes flick to you. “Dispatch generated the event. Working number incoming.”

Kellan nods at your coaching, lips pressed tight, hands visible on his knees. He looks like he wants to talk himself safe and knows he can’t.

Pritchard continues, voice low. “Exit plan: I’ll have Mott take you out the **rear service**—alley side—after we finish. We’ll stage a unit at the mouth so you can get picked up on the avenue, not at your curb. Marrowline approaches you, we document it, and I make it a problem for them.” He pauses. “But understand: they play in the gray. They’ll try to make you step into it.”

From outside, muffled through plaster and the strip of hallway, a deeper engine note rises and then settles—like a vehicle rolling forward and stopping short. Not a patrol idle. Heavier. Deliberate.

Mott keys her mic once more, clipped. “Dispatch, confirm working number.” The reply is thin but clear: “Event number 26-0416-198. Units en route holding.”

Pritchard repeats it so it sticks. “Two-six, zero-four-one-six, one-nine-eight. Write it down. That’s your paper trail.”

### Turn 64 [PLAYER]

I jot down **26-0416-198** and look to Pritchard. “Please note on the report: I’m refusing consent for any Marrowline entry or access to my office or devices; any contact attempts should be documented.”  

I lower my voice. “Before we move, can Mott or your posted unit confirm the rear service hallway and alley are clear—no Marrowline vehicle staged back there?”

*Agent reasoning: I’ve got the case number and a promised rear exit, but that engine outside feels like Marrowline repositioning. I should lock in a concise statement on record, minimize what I disclose, and confirm the rear route is clear before we move.*

### Turn 65 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Pritchard agrees to document your refusal and orders a quick rear-check. The check comes back **not clear**—there’s a vehicle positioned in the alley that isn’t one of his units, and it’s sitting like it’s waiting for a door to open.

Pritchard takes your note with a curt nod and says it out loud for Mott to catch: “Add it to the report: no consent for Marrowline entry, no access to devices, and document any contact attempts.” He looks at you a half-second longer. “If they touch your door or your person after that, it stops being ‘compliance.’”

The laundry room’s heat presses against your face; to the west—through the door seam—you can see the posted unit’s boots planted in the hall, shifting stance as his radio hisses.

Mott steps to the door, cracks it just enough to speak without giving the hallway much of her body. “Unit Two, check rear service to alley. Confirm clear. Eyes on, not a walkabout.”

A pause. Then the officer’s voice comes back, filtered and tight: “Rear hallway clear to the service door. Alley’s got a dark sedan, engine off, no markings. Parked angled toward the service exit. One occupant, maybe two—can’t confirm through tint.”

Pritchard’s jaw sets. “That’s not mine,” he says quietly, and you can hear the decision click into place. He keys his radio once, low and authoritative: “Hold rear door. No civilian movement until we ID that vehicle. Send another unit to alley approach—silent.”

Downstairs, muffled through floors and pipes, the Marrowline voice gets sharper—like they’ve been told “no” and don’t accept it. The building feels suddenly smaller, exits turning into chokepoints.

### Turn 66 [PLAYER]

I keep my back to the machines and my eyes on the door seam. “Sergeant—let’s hold here. Can your alley unit run the plate or at least get make/model and any distinguishing marks; and confirm if it matches the sedan that peeled north toward Mercer?”  

I glance at Kellan, steady. “Stay seated, hands visible, no phones.” Then back to Mott, low: “Can you kill our names on any further radio and keep comms face-to-face where possible—if they’re scanning, I don’t want them learning we’re trapped on the second floor.”

*Agent reasoning: A staged sedan at our planned exit could be an abduction attempt; moving now is risky. Best is to stay put, gather identifiers, and let police control contact while I keep Kellan calm and reduce information leakage.*

### Turn 67 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Pritchard gets the alley unit moving on your request—plate attempt, vehicle details, and comparison to the Mercer runner. Mott also tightens comms discipline; your names stop going over open radio. The downside: the alley sedan’s occupants notice the police attention and start to reposition.

The laundry room vibrates with a dryer’s off-balance thump; your eyes stay on the door seam where hallway light cuts a thin blade across the tile. Outside, the posted unit shifts, hand near his belt, listening hard.

Pritchard keys his shoulder mic, voice clipped and careful. “Alley unit: hold cover, get make/model, any marks, attempt plate. Compare to earlier partial—…7K3—advise. Do not approach solo.”

He looks back to you. “If it’s the same car, that ties your earlier observation to an active interference. That’s leverage—for me, not for Marrowline.”

Mott answers your comms request with a quick nod. She turns her mic away from her mouth and speaks low, almost ventriloquized. “Copy. No names on air. We’ll use ‘witness one’ and ‘witness two’ only. Anything sensitive, face-to-face.” She then steps to the door and murmurs to the posted officer—close enough you can’t catch every word—clearly re-briefing him without broadcasting it.

Radio crackles back from the alley, hushed urgency: “Dark sedan appears to be a Marrowline fleet—same body style as their unmarked. No rear plate visible from angle; front plate partially obstructed. I can confirm last three: **7K3**. Driver just sat up—looks like they clocked us.”

A beat later: “Vehicle rolling—slow—trying to nose out of alley without headlights. Turning toward the avenue.”

Pritchard’s face hardens. “That’s your Mercer car,” he says, more certain than before. He keys the mic again. “Do not pursue into traffic. Maintain visual if safe. Mark direction and time.”

Down the stairwell, the Marrowline voices shift—less bluster, more coordination—like they’ve realized police are starting to treat this as interference instead of customer service.

### Turn 68 [PLAYER]

I keep my voice low. “Sergeant, log that as suspected witness intimidation tied to Marrowline—partial plate …7K3, no headlights, obstructed plate. Can you have the alley unit grab a timestamp and direction of travel for the report?”

I glance at Kellan. “You’re doing fine—stay put.”

Back to Pritchard: “Until you’ve got a second unit on the rear and someone between us and the lobby, I don’t want either of us moved. And if Marrowline asks for us again, tell them we’ll provide statements through you only—no direct contact.”

*Agent reasoning: The sedan matching my earlier sighting suggests coordinated pressure; I want to lock in details for the report, avoid being moved while exits are uncertain, and prevent Marrowline from separating me and Kellan. I’ll push for protective handling and a controlled exit only after units are in place.*

### Turn 69 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Pritchard logs it the way you want—*witness intimidation / interference, suspected Marrowline involvement*—and gets the alley unit to capture timestamp and direction for the report. He also backs your demand to keep you and Kellan in place until he has bodies on both choke points, and he formally shuts Marrowline out of direct contact.

The laundry room air is hot and lint-dry; the seam under the door shows a thin bar of hallway light, and every time the dryer lurches it makes the building feel like it’s breathing wrong.

Pritchard pulls his notebook closer, writing as he speaks so it’s not “later.” “Partial plate …7K3. Obstructed plate. No headlights. Vehicle repositioned on police presence. Logged as suspected intimidation—tie to Marrowline pending confirmation.” He looks up at you. “That language matters. It changes how my people treat them.”

He keys his radio, careful with identifiers. “Alley unit: I need exact time and direction of travel for the report. If you can safely grab a make/model and any fleet identifiers, do it. No chase.”

The reply comes back a moment later, breath controlled: “Timestamp **02:41**. Dark sedan moved eastbound out the alley toward Avenue line. No headlights until it cleared the mouth. Possible Marrowline fleet—body style matches. Still only last three confirmed: 7K3.”

In the hall outside, Mott leans in just enough to keep it face-to-face. “Second unit’s two minutes out to the rear. Lobby officer’s holding the stairwell landing now—nobody comes up without a uniform escort.”

From downstairs, the Marrowline compliance rep’s tone changes—less performative, more cold. You catch fragments through the stairwell: “—need to ensure—” “—liability—” then Pritchard answers from where he stands, loud enough to carry without giving details: “Statements through me only. No direct contact. Step back from the entrance.”

Kellan stays seated like you told him, hands open on his knees. His eyes flick to you once—grateful, scared, trying not to show either.

### Turn 70 [PLAYER]

I keep my eyes on the door seam. “Sergeant, I want it in the report that Marrowline attempted to assert control of the scene and demanded direct access to us—names, if you have them.”

I glance at Mott. “When that second unit arrives, can one of you do a quick sweep of the stairwell and hallway for anyone loitering—no surprises if we have to move?”

Back to Pritchard, low. “Given the ‘camera node’ claim—do you think my office network or phone could be compromised? If so, I’m powering down and bagging devices until we’re clear. Tell me what you need from me statement-wise, and what you want me not to say in earshot of their people.”

*Agent reasoning: We’ve got potential intimidation and a coordinated corporate presence; safest move is to stay put, tighten documentation, and get clarity on next steps and what info we should/shouldn’t share. I also want to know if our phones/office systems are compromised given the “camera node” claim.*

### Turn 72 [PLAYER]

“Sergeant, I want it explicitly in the report that Marrowline tried to take control of the scene and demanded direct access to us—names and descriptions if your people have them.”

I glance to Mott. “When your second unit arrives, can you sweep the stairwell and hallway for loiterers before we move? I don’t want surprises.”

Back to Pritchard, quieter. “That ‘camera node’ line—do you think my office network or phone could be compromised? If yes, I’m powering down and isolating my devices until we’re clear. Tell me what you need in my statement, and what you want me not to say within earshot of their reps.”

*Agent reasoning: Marrowline’s hovering and a staged sedan suggest intimidation and possible surveillance; I need Pritchard to document everything, keep the route clear, and avoid leaking details. I’ll also minimize digital exposure by powering down and isolating devices, but I want the sergeant’s guidance on what to state where.*

### Turn 73 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Pritchard agrees and has Marrowline’s behavior documented as *attempted scene control / attempted direct witness contact*. Mott commits to a sweep as soon as the second unit hits the floor. Pritchard also confirms your devices could plausibly be compromised given the “camera node” angle—and gives you a tight script for what to say (and not say) while Marrowline is within earshot.

The laundry room’s still your box: door seam glowing thinly, dryer thumping to your left, detergent bite in the air. Through the stairwell, voices below carry in chopped pieces—Marrowline staying close enough to be heard, not close enough to be touched.

Pritchard flips a page in his notebook and speaks while he writes. “I’ll put it in plain language: Marrowline personnel attempted to direct officers, demanded access to witnesses, and requested identifying information. Names if we get them—right now I’ve got a male voice claiming ‘Compliance’ and at least one other adult male, dark jacket, earpiece. Mott’s bodycam has the rest if she was facing them.”

Mott shifts her stance at the door, eyes hard. “Second unit’s almost here. When they arrive, I’ll take them up the stairwell and sweep down the hall—slow, hands-on doors, check alcoves. If anyone’s loitering, we’ll ID them or move them along.”

Pritchard lowers his voice to match yours. “Yes—your office network and phone could be compromised without you ever touching anything. If they’ve got access to camera infrastructure, they can also have access to the *people* who manage it. Powering down is smart. If you’ve got evidence-sensitive devices, keep them on your person and don’t leave them unattended.”

He glances toward the door seam like he can see through it. “Statement-wise: give me **times, what you saw, what was said, where you were standing**, the partial plate, the no-headlights movement, and the fact you felt pressured. Do **not** say anything about ‘rewriting feeds,’ missing footage, burner calls, or anything tying this to a bigger pattern while their reps are in the building. That becomes their plaything in real time.”

From the stairwell, the compliance rep tries again—more polite, more threatening underneath: “Sergeant, we need to verify the integrity of our node—” Pritchard answers without moving. “Integrity gets verified after my report. Step back.”

Kellan stays where you told him, breathing shallow, watching your hands like they’re the only steady thing in the room.

### Turn 74 [PLAYER]

I power my phone fully down, pop the battery if I can, and wrap it in a spare lint-free rag from the shelf before tucking it deep inside my jacket.  

Quiet to Pritchard: “I’ll give you a clean timeline—starting from when I first noticed the Mercer sedan and the exact wording of what their ‘Compliance’ guy demanded; tell me when you want it, and I’ll keep it strictly to you.”  

To Mott, low: “When you sweep, can you confirm the nearest safe exit route that doesn’t pass the lobby—rear stairs, roof access, anything—and how you want us positioned when we move?”

*Agent reasoning: Devices may be compromised, so I should limit signals and preserve evidence. We’re still boxed in until the sweep and extra unit arrive, so I’ll stay put, prep a safe move plan, and get key details to Pritchard quietly without tipping Marrowline.*

I glance to Mott. “On your sweep, can you identify a safe exit that avoids the lobby—rear stairs, roof access, whatever’s clean—and tell me how you want us stacked when we move?”

I look to Mott. “On your sweep, find us an exit that doesn’t touch the lobby—rear stairs, roof access, anything—and tell me how you want us stacked when we move.”

*Agent reasoning: My phone is a liability if Marrowline can touch networks; I need it dead and isolated. Before moving, I want a safe route that avoids the lobby and a controlled formation, and I need to coordinate a clean statement with Pritchard without feeding Marrowline anything.*

I power my phone down, pop the battery if it’ll come free, wrap it in a lint-free rag, and tuck it deep in my inside pocket. “Pritchard—when you’re ready, I’ll give you a clean timeline from the Mercer sedan onward, but I want it out of earshot of Marrowline.”

I look to Mott. “On your sweep, find us an exit that avoids the lobby—rear stairs, roof, service corridor—then tell me how you want us stacked when we move.”

*Agent reasoning: Devices might be compromised; I should isolate mine and coordinate a safe exit while giving police a controlled statement away from Marrowline.*

### Turn 81 [GAME]

Your phone goes dark with a hard click. The back plate fights you—tight seams, modern glue—but you get a fingernail purchase and peel it enough to confirm the bad news: sealed battery. No quick pull. You wrap the whole handset in the rag anyway and bury it deep in your inside pocket, cloth against glass to kill any accidental wake.

In the second-floor corridor outside your office, the air smells like wet wool and old detergent drifting from the laundry room down the hall. The door brace you rigged still bites into the frame; the desk lamp sits heavy in your hand, cord trailing like a tail.

Sergeant Pritchard’s radio crackles at his shoulder—tinny voices, overlapping codes—then he cups it and steps closer, angling his body to block the hallway sightline. “Good,” he says, low. “Out of earshot is smart. But understand this: Marrowline hears plenty without being in the room.” His eyes flick to the Marrowline credential on your desk like it’s a lit match. “You give me that timeline when I say. And you keep your voice down enough that my own guys don’t ‘help’ by repeating it.”

Officer Drea Mott is already moving—quiet, professional. She checks the stairwell door first, palm to the metal for vibration, then cracks it and looks down, not up. “Rear stair smells clean,” she murmurs, and you hear her boots take two steps, stop, listen. A muffled engine idle seeps through the brick somewhere outside—Marrowline still sitting on the street, patient as a metronome.

Mott comes back with a quick nod. “Service corridor ties to the laundry room. There’s a maintenance hatch to the roof access ladder—old, but it opens. Rear stairs drop to the alley exit; alley’s the risk.” She looks at you, then at Pritchard. “If we move, I want you between us, Vane. Pritchard takes rear. No talking once we’re in the stairwell.”

Pritchard’s phone buzzes once; he doesn’t check it. “We’re on borrowed quiet,” he says. “Marrowline patrol outside isn’t here for coffee.”

### Turn 82 [PLAYER]

I slide the Marrowline credential off my desk and into my pocket without flashing it, then murmur to Pritchard, “Before we move—how many on that second unit, and are they coming up rear stairs or front? I want eyes on the alley before we commit.”

To Mott, barely audible: “If the alley’s hot, we go roof first. Can you check that hatch quietly and tell me if there’s any sign it’s been used tonight—fresh scuffs, warm metal, anything?”

*Agent reasoning: Marrowline’s outside and could be watching exits; I want more intel before moving and I don’t want our route broadcast. I’ll ask for the second unit status and quietly prep a safer option—roof first, then reassess—while eliminating obvious identifiers like the credential.*

### Turn 83 [GAME]

You palm the Marrowline credential off the desk like it’s just another receipt and sink it into your pocket without letting the laminate catch the hall light. Pritchard notices anyway—his eyes drop, then come back up, a flicker of approval buried under fatigue.

“Second unit?” he murmurs back, keeping his mouth barely moving. He taps his shoulder mic twice—silent key-up, no broadcast—then listens to the hiss of the channel like it’s a seashell. “I’ve got *two* more uniforms staged—Pritchard’s relief—supposed to come *front stairwell*, not rear. But the radio traffic’s sloppy. If Marrowline’s leaning on dispatch, plans change without paper.”

He shifts half a step to the stairwell door and angles his head. “Alley eyes—yeah. But not with a face in the glass. We’ll use sound and reflection before we commit.”

Down the hall, Mott is already gliding toward the laundry room, shoulders tight to the wall. The building’s fluorescent lights buzz like insects; somewhere below, a door thumps shut and the vibration runs up the pipes.

At your whisper, Mott gives a small, precise nod and works the laundry room door open with two fingers, easing it so the latch never clicks. You hear the soft scrape of her boot soles on tile, then the faint metallic kiss of a ladder rung. She’s careful—weight placed, tested, shifted.

A minute later she’s back at the threshold, voice almost nothing. “Hatch hasn’t been opened recently. Dust webbing on the hinge line is intact. No fresh scuffs on the ladder rails. Metal’s cold.” Her eyes cut toward the rear stairwell. “But I caught a draft—someone opened the *alley* door downstairs in the last few minutes. Could’ve been building, could’ve been them.”

Pritchard’s radio spits a clipped phrase—“…unit checking rear…”—then goes dead again under his palm. He looks at you, expression tightening. “That wasn’t my guy.”

**Status updates:**  
- Marrowline credential: concealed on you  
- Second unit: 2 uniforms, front (planned)

### Turn 84 [PLAYER]

I lean in, voice tight. “Rear’s burned—assume someone’s in that stairwell or at the alley door. We go roof.”  

To Mott: “Lead us to the laundry room and that hatch—slow and silent. Before we climb, can you listen at the hatch seam for footsteps or radios on the roof?”  

To Pritchard: “Kill your radio volume and keep it palmed. If you can, text your two uniforms to hold front and not to ‘check rear’—and don’t use names.”

*Agent reasoning: “Unit checking rear” isn’t Pritchard’s—rear stairs may be compromised. Roof hatch seems unused and safer. I should avoid the alley, confirm whether the rear stairwell is occupied without exposing us, and coordinate a quiet move plan.*

### Turn 85 [GAME]

Mott doesn’t argue. She just pivots and starts you down the corridor toward the laundry room, one hand up to slow the pace, the other hovering near her duty light so it doesn’t flare. Pritchard drops his radio volume to a whisper and keeps it palmed like it’s a live wire.

The hall’s narrow—doors on your left, a grimy window at the far end reflecting smeared neon from Harker Ave. The building hums with old pipes and distant traffic; under it, you catch a faint *thunk… thunk* from below that could be boots on concrete—rear stairwell, or someone testing the alley door again.

At the laundry room, Mott eases the door open without a click. Dryer heat and detergent hit you in the face, damp and chemical. She crosses to the maintenance ladder and climbs two rungs, then stops and presses the side of her head near the hatch seam. She holds still long enough that you hear your own blood.

“Roof is quiet,” she breathes. “No footfalls. No radio chatter. But—” she pauses, listening harder, “—there’s a vehicle up there? Not moving. Could be HVAC vibration… or someone idling a generator near the roof access of the next building. Hard to tell through the metal.”

Behind you, Pritchard pulls out his phone and types with his thumb shielded by his body. No names, just blunt direction. He keeps his face blank like he’s writing a grocery list. A second later, his phone buzzes once—confirmation. He murmurs, “Front holds. They’re spooked, but they’ll stay put.”

As he pockets the phone, his radio—still palmed—catches a hot mic burst: a man’s voice, not Pritchard’s, low and annoyed. “…rear door’s been touched. Check the second floor—quiet.”

Pritchard and Mott both freeze at the same time. Mott’s eyes flick to you: that voice wasn’t a uniform, and it wasn’t dispatch.

**Immediate outcome:** You get to the roof hatch undetected; Mott confirms no clear movement on the roof, while a non-police voice directs someone to check your floor.

**Status updates**
- Roof route: clear (for now)
- Front uniforms: holding position
- Hostile search: moving to 2nd floor

### Turn 86 [PLAYER]

I whisper, “That wasn’t a cop—move, now.” Mott, ease the hatch open just enough for a look and listen; Pritchard, you go up first and cover the opening while I come up last—no lights. If we hear boots in the hall, we freeze and let them pass.

*Agent reasoning: Someone non-police is coordinating a quiet search on our floor; we need to get off this level immediately without making noise. The roof is our best route, but we should minimize exposure when we pop the hatch and confirm what that “vehicle vibration” is before fully committing.*

### Turn 87 [GAME]

Mott moves the second you whisper it—no wasted nods. She slides her fingertips under the hatch lip and lifts it a fraction, metal whispering against metal. Cold air spills down the seam, carrying tar, rain, and the faint oily bite of rooftop exhaust.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** The hatch opens just enough for a slit view. The roof access is *not* empty—someone’s up there.

Through the gap you catch the underside of a boot planted near the hatch frame and the hem of a dark raincoat. A hand holds a radio close to the mouth, but they’re not transmitting—listening. The person shifts weight once, slow and patient, like they’ve been standing there a while.

Mott freezes with the hatch suspended on muscle alone, then eases it back down the same fraction—no clank, no scrape. Her whisper is barely air: “One. Right on top of us.”

Behind you, Pritchard has already stepped in close, body angled to shield the ladder well. His radio is still palmed, volume killed. He leans toward your ear. “That’s Marrowline posture,” he murmurs. “They like to post on exits and wait for ‘voluntary contact.’”

Down the hall—west of the laundry room door—you hear it: soft, measured footfalls on carpet, then the faint tick of a door buzzer somewhere on the floor. Not running. Searching. The laundry room’s fluorescent ballast hum suddenly feels loud enough to testify.

Mott keeps her eyes on the hatch, one hand still on the lip. “If we go up, we go into him,” she breathes. “If we stay, they come to us.”

Pritchard’s jaw tightens. “We can hold quiet here, but if they open this door, it’s over. I can’t arrest my way out of Marrowline.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re in the second-floor laundry room, ladder directly ahead, hatch above; hallway and approaching boots just outside the door.

### Turn 88 [PLAYER]

I quietly pull the laundry room door almost shut, leaving it barely cracked, and gesture Mott to kill the fluorescents if there’s a switch without making a click. To Pritchard, I whisper, “No hero stuff—if they open that door, we let them step in, then we slip past behind them,” and I crouch behind the nearest washer, listening for how many sets of boots and where they stop.

*Agent reasoning: Roof is covered and the hall search is closing; I need a low-risk hide/ambush point and a way to misdirect without forcing a confrontation. Laundry room gives concealment and options (machines, vents, water), so I’ll kill the obvious signs we’re here and prepare to either slip them or stall.*

### Turn 89 [GAME]

You ease the laundry room door in until it’s a hair from shut, leaving a thin, angled crack that turns the hallway into a sliver of shadow and sound.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Mott finds the switch—an old toggle by the doorframe. She pinches it between thumb and nail and flips it with a controlled, muffled *tck*. The fluorescents die. The room drops into dim city-glow leaking through the grimy window and the red LED dots on two machines. Your little triangle of darkness becomes believable clutter instead of a lit stage.

You slide behind the nearest washer, crouched low. The metal is cold and damp. Soap residue and old lint sour the air.

In the hall beyond the crack: **two sets of boots**, measured and close together, stop about six feet from the laundry room door. Not cops—no radio squawk, no clipped “clear.” Just breathing and the soft brush of fabric. One voice, male, low: “Light’s off now.” Another, quieter: “They’re in here.”

Pritchard, pressed to the wall beside the door, whispers without moving his lips, “They’re not announcing. That’s bad.” He keeps his radio palmed, but you feel the tension in him—he’s fighting instinct to challenge.

Above you, the roof hatch gives the faintest metallic creak—not opening, just weight shifting on it. The watcher up top is still posted, listening for exactly this kind of movement.

The hallway searcher closest to the door produces something that scrapes softly—plastic on metal—like a slim pry wedge or a bypass tool. The door handle doesn’t turn yet; they’re testing patience, trying to make you make noise.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Laundry room: lights out

### Turn 90 [PLAYER]

I stay crouched and silently point Mott toward any secondary door or service access in the laundry room, then tap my ear and hold up two fingers for “two outside.” To Pritchard, barely a breath: “If they start working the latch, make one sharp noise down the hall—then fall back; we slip out the other way.” I slowly scan the dark for a back door, window latch, or any maintenance passage we can take without touching the roof hatch.

*Agent reasoning: We’re pinned between a roof watcher and two quiet intruders with tools; direct confrontation is high risk. Best move is misdirection—draw them into overcommitting, then slip out through an alternate route. The laundry room likely has a secondary exit (service corridor/vent/utility door), so I should scout for it while staying silent and coordinate a timed move with Mott and Pritchard.*

### Turn 91 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Your scan pays off—there’s a way out that doesn’t touch the roof hatch.

In the dim, you spot a **secondary door** half-hidden behind stacked detergent cartons and a rusted mop bucket. It’s painted the same institutional beige as the walls, but the hinges are newer. A stenciled label reads **“SERVICE CORRIDOR / BOILER”**. The knob has a simple privacy latch—no deadbolt. Mott glides to it on stocking-quiet steps and tests it with two fingers: it gives a millimeter, then stops. Not locked—**held shut by something on the other side**, like a push-bar wedged or a cart parked tight.

She leans back to you, whisper-thin: “It’s blocked, not keyed. I can shoulder it once, but they’ll hear.”

You flash the two-finger signal; Mott answers with a small, tight nod. Pritchard watches the laundry door crack like it’s a gun sight.

Outside, one of the searchers finally commits—plastic-on-metal again, and the **latch plate ticks** as a shim slides in. Not forcing yet; *probing*. The other searcher murmurs, close enough to smell through the crack, “If they’re inside, they’re behind the machines.”

Pritchard inhales to speak and doesn’t; he just shifts his weight, ready to do what you said. He whispers, “Sharp noise where—stairwell end?”

A faint vibration runs through the floor—somebody moving in the **rear stairwell** below, or the alley door being tried again. The building’s old bones carry it.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re crouched behind the washer bank along the east wall; laundry door is west with a narrow crack; the service door is south, blocked from the far side.

The pressure tightens: the shim outside keeps working, and the rooftop watcher above stays planted—no help coming from up.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Service corridor door: blocked, unkeyed  
- Hallway searchers: shimming latch  
- Rear stairwell: movement/vibration detected

### Turn 92 [PLAYER]

I whisper to Pritchard, “Stairwell end—make it sound like someone bolted, then move away from this door.” To Mott, I murmur, “On his noise, put your shoulder into that service door once—just enough to clear the block—and we go through fast.” I brace low behind the washer, watching the latch crack for the moment they commit, ready to move the instant Pritchard’s distraction lands.

*Agent reasoning: Roof is covered and the front door is being shimmed; we need a quieter exit. The service door is blocked, but that’s still better than a direct confrontation if we can make the noise elsewhere and force the searchers to reposition. I’ll stage Mott to hit the blocked door on a cue while Pritchard creates a distraction down the hall, then we slip through before they recover.*

### Turn 93 [GAME]

Pritchard gives you the smallest nod, then peels off the wall like a shadow unhooking itself. He moves down the hall away from the laundry room door—soft at first—then, right at the stairwell end, he **kicks a loose radiator cover** and lets it clatter hard. Immediately after, he **runs three heavy steps** and slaps a palm against the stairwell door like someone just hit it in a panic.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** The two outside your cracked door bite on it.

“One—stairs!” one of them barks, and both sets of boots surge away from the laundry room, sprinting toward Pritchard’s noise. Their urgency is real; they think they’ve got a runner.

The instant their weight leaves your door, Mott plants her shoulder into the service door—**one controlled hit**, low and tight. Something on the far side—metal on tile, like a janitor cart—shifts and scrapes. The door gives you **a narrow wedge of space**. Enough.

You slip through first, turning sideways. The service corridor beyond is pitch-dark, close, and hot with boiler breath. Pipes run along the ceiling like ribs. Mott follows, then Pritchard doubles back fast and quiet, sliding into the gap just before the hallway boots rebound.

Behind you, the laundry room door creaks—someone at the end of the hall realizes the sound was wrong, too late. A voice carries: “Back—check the—”

Pritchard hisses as he squeezes in, “They’ll be on that door in seconds. And whoever’s on the roof heard the corridor scrape.” He’s not guessing—above, the building answers with a faint *thunk* as the rooftop watcher shifts position, tracking by sound.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re now in the **service corridor south of the laundry**, shoulder-to-shoulder between pipework and cinderblock; the laundry room door is behind you to the north, the corridor runs deeper ahead toward boilers and a service exit smell of alley rain.

The corridor offers cover, but it’s a sound tunnel—every breath and shoe scuff travels.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Hallway searchers: pulled off door

### Turn 94 [PLAYER]

I whisper, “No roof—alley exit if it exists,” and motion Mott forward to scout the corridor’s next junction while I take rear, listening for the laundry door getting hit. To Pritchard: “If you know this building, point me to any service stairs or exterior door—now.” I move in a crouched, careful pace toward the boiler end, pausing at each doorway to listen before we pass.

*Agent reasoning: We bought seconds, not minutes. The corridor likely leads to a boiler room and a service exit; that’s safer than the roof with a watcher. Need to move quietly, check for a door to alley, and avoid getting boxed in if the searchers breach behind us.*

### Turn 95 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You get moving order and intel fast—before the hallway catches up.

Mott glides ahead, one hand riding the cinderblock to keep orientation. You take rear, crouched, ears tuned to the laundry door behind. Pritchard, breathing through his nose, answers your question without looking back: “This corridor runs to the boiler room. Past it—service stairs down to the basement. Basement’s got an exterior door to the alley, but it’s usually chained open from inside with a cheap padlock. Super does it to keep vagrants out.”

Behind you, the laundry door gets hit—**one hard shoulder**. The sound travels down the pipework like a bell. A voice, closer now, snaps: “Service corridor—go, go.” Their boots don’t clatter on tile yet; they’re still funneling to the right spot, but they’ve found your line.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** The corridor runs south; to your left (east) are narrow maintenance closets with louvered doors; ahead, the air warms and smells of rust and damp heat—boiler room.

Mott pauses at the first junction: a **half-open louvered door** with a sliver of light inside—an old maintenance closet. She leans back and whispers, “Closet—tools. Could hide, could grab something.” Then she points ahead: a red-painted metal door marked **BOILER** with a small wired-glass window fogged by heat.

Pritchard adds, low and urgent, “Basement stairs are loud. Metal treads. If they’re in the corridor behind us, they’ll hear every step unless we time it with their banging.”

From above—through the pipe chase—comes a faint, irregular *tap… tap…* like someone using a flashlight bezel or knuckle to signal through structure. The rooftop watcher isn’t coming down; they’re **communicating**.

A second impact rattles the laundry-side doorframe behind you. This time it’s followed by the sharper sound of a latch giving way—**they’re through or nearly through**.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Searchers: committed to corridor
- Boiler end: stairs to basement likely

### Turn 96 [PLAYER]

I whisper, “Ten seconds—grab me anything that cuts a cheap padlock,” and slip into the maintenance closet just long enough to scan for bolt cutters or a heavy wrench. If I spot something useful, I take it and immediately gesture both of them through the BOILER door, moving fast to the basement stairs and timing our descent with the searchers’ boots hitting the corridor behind us.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to flood the corridor; we need the basement exit. A quick tool grab could help with a padlock, but lingering is risky—best is a fast check for bolt cutters or a heavy wrench, then push through the boiler door and time the noisy stairs with the pursuers’ entry noise.*

### Turn 97 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You get what you need—barely in time.

You slip into the maintenance closet and sweep your eyes over the silhouettes: mop handles, a dented toolbox, spare pipe fittings. No full-size bolt cutters—too expensive to leave lying around—but on the middle shelf there’s a **24" adjustable wrench** and, in the toolbox, a **pair of compact cable cutters** (meant for wire, but they’ll bite a cheap padlock shackle if it’s soft or thin). You snatch both.

Mott is already at the BOILER door, palm on the push bar. Pritchard leans in, voice tight: “Boiler room’s a furnace—don’t linger. Stairs are right side, down.”

Behind you, the corridor erupts—boots hit tile, close and fast. A Marrowline voice, breathy with adrenaline: “Door’s open—move!” Their light splashes through the louvered slats for a split second as they sweep past your last position.

You wave Mott and Pritchard through the BOILER door and follow, pulling it nearly shut behind you without letting it click. The boiler room air hits like a wet fist—hot metal, oil, and steam. To the west, the boilers squat like dark animals; to the east, a **metal stairwell** drops into the basement, each tread ready to sing.

You time it: as the searchers’ boots hammer into the corridor outside, you take the first steps down—your own footfalls swallowed under their noise. Mott goes first, light on her feet. Pritchard follows, muttering, “They’ll check boiler next. They always do.”

Overhead, that earlier *tap… tap…* becomes a sharper **knock sequence** through the pipework—someone relaying your movement. Pritchard hears it too; his jaw tightens. “Rooftop’s coordinating. Means there’s a ground team.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re descending the **metal service stairs** on the east side of the boiler room; heat and steam cling to your clothes, and the stair rail is slick with condensation.

### Turn 98 [PLAYER]

I keep one hand on the slick rail and whisper, “Slow—listen,” pausing mid-stair to catch any voices or footsteps below. To Pritchard: “Basement door—left or right at the bottom, and is there another way out if it’s blocked?” I keep the cable cutters ready in my pocket and the wrench low in my hand, then continue down only if the landing sounds clear.

*Agent reasoning: We’ve got a narrow lead and loud stairs; I need to confirm where the alley door is, check for anyone already in the basement, and be ready to cut a cheap lock fast without getting boxed in.*

### Turn 99 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You catch the basement before it catches you.

You freeze mid-stair, palm tight on the slick rail. The boiler heat makes the metal sweat; your breath sounds too loud until you slow it.

Below: **two voices**, low and clipped, somewhere in the basement—muffled by concrete but close enough to matter. Not cops. Marrowline cadence. One of them says, “—said he went *down*, not out. Hold the alley door. Don’t be a hero.” A second voice answers, “Copy. Light’s dead in the west run.”

Mott, one step below you, stops dead and tilts her head, confirming she heard it too. Pritchard leans up close behind your shoulder and whispers back, “Basement exterior’s **right** at the bottom—down the short hall, steel door to the alley. If it’s blocked—there’s an old **coal chute** on the left side of the basement. Super boarded it, but it vents to the alley grating. Tight squeeze. You’ll get filthy, but it’s a way.”

Upstairs, through the boiler-room door you left nearly shut, you hear the corridor team arrive—bootfalls and a hand slapping metal. Someone tries the BOILER door handle; it rattles once, testing. They haven’t committed through yet, but they’re there.

You ease down only when the bottom landing goes quiet for a beat—no footsteps on the last few steps, no shadow crossing the stairwell mouth. The basement smells colder: wet cardboard, old detergent, and the sour bite of standing water.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re on the lower third of the **basement service stairs**, boiler room above/behind; the stairwell opens into a dim basement with light leaking from a cracked utility bulb somewhere to the right.

Mott’s hand hovers near her radio but she doesn’t key it—too loud. Pritchard’s voice tightens: “If they’re holding the alley door, they expect you. Means somebody fed them the route.”

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Basement: Marrowline voices present  
- Alley door: likely covered  
- Boiler door: being tested upstairs

### Turn 100 [PLAYER]

I whisper, “Coal chute—left. Alley door’s a trap,” and motion Mott to creep down one step at a time and peek the basement corner without showing her whole body. To Pritchard, barely audible: “Lead me to the chute—quiet and fast—no lights.” I keep low, wrench ready, and start angling left as soon as Mott signals the immediate landing is clear.

*Agent reasoning: Alley door is covered and upstairs is about to push in; the coal chute is the quieter, less expected exit. We need eyes on the basement positions without exposing ourselves, then move before they commit through the boiler door.*

### Turn 101 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Mott’s peek confirms your read—alley door is covered—so you slide left toward the coal chute without stepping into their cone.

Mott creeps down the last steps like she’s lowering herself into a grave, then leans just enough to sight the basement corner. Her eyes flick back to you and she gives a tight, flat hand signal: **two**. She whispers, “Right-side hall. One posted by the steel door, one back near the utility sink—watching the stairs.”

Pritchard doesn’t argue. He keeps his shoulders hunched and guides you left, one hand hovering near the wall to feel your way. “Chute’s behind the old storage cages,” he breathes. “Boarded with plywood and screws. If it’s still there.”

You move low, wrench down at thigh level, cable cutters in your pocket. The basement floor is uneven and damp; your shoe skims a shallow puddle that smells like bleach gone stale.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** At the stairwell mouth, you angle **left (west)** into a darker run of basement—stacked wire cages and a sagging shelf line the wall; the only light is a weak bulb bleeding from the **right-side (east)** hall where the alley door sits.

As you ghost along the cages, the Marrowline pair to the right keeps talking—too confident. “He’s gonna try the alley,” one says. The other snorts. “Let him. We just need the credential and whatever he pulled from that office.”

Up above, metal scrapes—someone finally shouldering the BOILER door. Mott stiffens at the sound, then keeps moving, staying between you and the open sightlines.

Pritchard stops at a shadowed recess. There it is: **a plywood panel** over a low, rectangular opening—edges swollen with water. The screws are visible, cheap Phillips heads, some already rusted. He points, then murmurs, “If they bring lights left, we’re cooked.”

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Alley door: covered (2 Marrowline)

### Turn 102 [PLAYER]

I whisper, “Mott—eyes right, call it if they turn. Pritchard—listen for steps coming left.” Then I jam the adjustable wrench under the swollen edge of the plywood and pry in short, controlled pops, trying to free a corner without letting the screws screech; as soon as there’s a gap, I use the cable cutters to snap or bend any stubborn screws and ease the panel off. “Chute first, then me—move fast and stay low.”

*Agent reasoning: The alley door is covered and the boiler team is about to come down, so the coal chute is our best exit. Quiet is critical; unscrewing is slow, so I’ll pry the swollen plywood with the wrench while Mott watches the right hall and Pritchard listens for the basement team shifting.*

### Turn 103 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** The plywood gives—quietly enough—but not cleanly, and the sound starts pulling attention.

You seat the wrench under the swollen edge and work it in short, controlled pops. The first pry is a dull *thunk*—wood fibers tearing more than screws turning. The second pop lifts a corner a finger-width. You slip the cable cutters in and **bite at the exposed screw shanks**, flexing them side to side until the rusted metal snaps with a muted *tink*.

It’s almost going your way—until one stubborn screw drags across the plywood and lets out a thin, high **squeal**.

Mott’s head whips right. In the east hall, one of the Marrowline guys pauses mid-sentence. “You hear that?” Boots shift—careful, not running. They’re trained.

Pritchard puts his ear to the cage frame like it’s a stethoscope and whispers, “One coming left. Slow steps. He’s checking, not charging.”

You get the panel free enough to **pull it outward and down**, easing it onto the damp concrete instead of letting it slap. Behind it: a low, black opening that breathes cold alley air. The chute drops at an angle, tight and gritty—bare metal and old coal dust.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** In the basement west run behind the storage cages, the chute mouth is open at knee height; cold air threads past your knuckles, carrying rain and street oil.

Mott stays half-hidden behind the cages, eyes locked on the right-side glow. She murmurs, “He’s slicing left—using the wall. Thirty feet.”

Overhead, the boiler-room door finally bangs fully open; a voice filters down, closer now: “Basement! Sweep it!”

Pritchard swallows and starts to lower himself toward the chute, but he hesitates just long enough to whisper, “If I get stuck, don’t stop. Don’t—”

### Turn 104 [PLAYER]

I grip Pritchard by the collar and shove him into the chute. “Go. If you hang up, keep crawling—don’t stop.”  
To Mott, a whisper: “Last one in, smear right—make ’em think we doubled back.” Then I slip into the chute after Pritchard, keeping the wrench tucked tight so it won’t clang.

*Agent reasoning: One of them is already probing left and a basement sweep is starting—if we hesitate we get pinned. Pritchard freezing could clog the only exit, so I need to push him through and buy seconds without a loud fight.*

### Turn 105 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Pritchard goes in hard and fast—almost too fast—buying you seconds, but the shove costs you noise and blood.

You clamp his collar and drive him into the chute. His boots scrape metal—*skrrt*—then he’s gone, shoulders twisting to fit. “Keep crawling,” you hiss, and he answers from inside, breath ragged: “I’m—moving.”

Mott catches your whisper and gives a single sharp nod. She waits half a heartbeat, then slides her weight **right**, letting her shoe drag through a wet patch and across gritty concrete—an ugly, deliberate smear that points back toward the stairwell mouth. She whispers, barely air: “Done.”

You drop into the chute after Pritchard, wrench pinned tight against your ribs. The metal is cold and gritty; old coal dust grabs your palms. Your knee bangs the lip on the way in—pain flares, but you keep it inside your teeth.

Behind you, in the basement, the approaching Marrowline man reaches the storage cages. His flashlight beam knifes left, catches the torn plywood edge and the fresh scrape marks. He doesn’t shout—he *radios*, calm and lethal: “West run. Chute’s open. They’re in it.”

From the boiler-room side, another voice answers through radio squawk: “Seal the alley. I want that grating watched. Nobody comes up.”

Pritchard’s voice comes back, tight with claustrophobia: “It narrows—stay behind me. Don’t—don’t push.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re inside the coal chute now, angled downward toward the alley grating; the air is colder, wet with rain and street exhaust, and every breath tastes like rust and soot.

Somewhere above and behind, boots start moving with purpose—no longer searching, now **containing**. Mott’s footsteps fade as she commits to the misdirection, then stop; you hear her exhale once, controlled, as if she’s holding position to listen.

### Turn 106 [PLAYER]

I hiss to Pritchard, “How far to the grate—ten feet or fifty? Any side hatch or junction?” Then I pause just long enough to whisper into my burner, “Mott—status, and can you slip after us or are you pinned?” and keep crawling, slow and quiet, wrench tight to my chest.

*Agent reasoning: They’ve spotted the chute and are sealing the alley, so I need intel fast—how far to the grate, any side access—and I can’t leave Mott behind without a signal. I’ll keep moving quietly, manage Pritchard’s panic, and try to coordinate with Mott without giving away our position.*

### Turn 107 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Pritchard answers—there’s distance and one side access—but your burner whisper risks giving away your position; you hear a radio chirp behind you as Marrowline tightens the net.

Pritchard keeps crawling, elbows rasping softly in the chute. “Fifty,” he breathes. “Maybe sixty. Grate’s at the alley wall—vertical bars, bolted. There’s a… a maintenance jog—like a side throat—about twenty feet down on the left. Might be a cleanout. Might be welded shut. I didn’t look, I just—kept moving.”

You pause just long enough to thumb the burner and murmur, “Mott—status, can you slip after us or are you pinned?”

Static. Then Mott’s voice, clipped and low, like she’s talking through teeth: “Pinned. One on the cages, one sweeping back toward boiler. They saw the chute. I can’t drop in without lighting them up. I’m holding behind the west cages—if they commit down the chute, I’ll peel out. If they stay, I’ll try to draw them east.”

As she speaks, a sharper sound rides the line—another voice, not hers, faint and distant like it’s leaking from her end: “—check the chute mouth. Don’t follow blind. Gas it if you have to.”

Mott goes dead a second later—either she cut it or had to.

Inside the chute, you resume crawling, slow and quiet, wrench hugged tight. Ahead, Pritchard’s boot heel taps metal once—he freezes, then whispers, “That’s the jog. Left. It’s… it’s open. Narrow.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re angled downward in the coal chute; the left wall ahead breaks into a darker side passage that smells less like soot and more like damp concrete and old detergent.

Behind you, from the building side, boots reposition and a flashlight beam briefly stutters across the chute mouth—light spilling in like a pale spill of milk, then gone. A canister clinks somewhere above, not thrown yet—just handled.

### Turn 108 [PLAYER]

“Take the left jog—now. If they gas the main chute, we’ll be dead in here.” I guide Pritchard into the side passage and follow, then whisper into the burner, “Mott—don’t follow us. If they toss gas, get out any way you can and meet at the alley mouth by the old laundromat sign—ten minutes.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to gas the chute, so staying in the main run is risky. The side jog might offer cover or an alternate exit; I need to get Pritchard into it and keep Mott from getting cornered without forcing her to follow into the trap.*

### Turn 109 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You get off the main chute before Marrowline commits to it. The side jog buys you air and angles—but it’s tighter, slower, and it doesn’t sound like a clean exit.

You shove close to Pritchard’s shoulder and steer him left. He fights the turn, ribs scraping metal, then slips into the side passage with a strangled grunt. You follow, flattening the wrench to your chest so it won’t ring. The moment your boots clear the junction, the main chute behind you catches a faint metallic *clink… clink*—someone at the mouth handling a canister, testing weight.

The jog isn’t coal chute anymore. It’s a maintenance throat: rough concrete, a shallow drop, and old utility brackets that snag clothing. Pritchard whispers, “This wasn’t on any building plan I’ve seen. Smells like laundry runoff—might tie into the old laundromat drain line.”

You thumb the burner and whisper, “Mott—don’t follow us. If they toss gas, get out any way you can and meet at the alley mouth by the old laundromat sign—ten minutes.”

Mott answers immediately, too steady for how bad her position sounded: “Copy. Ten minutes. Elias—listen—Marrowline’s not alone down here. I heard a civilian voice with them, older guy, Union cadence. They’re coordinating.” A pause, then: “I’m moving. If I go dark, assume I’m running.”

Behind you, from the main chute, a hiss blooms—soft at first, then eager. Not a full dump, more like a test spray or a can popped shallow. The air in your new passage stays cleaner, but you can smell something sharp trying to crawl around the corner.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re in the left side passage off the coal chute—narrow concrete, damp walls, the floor slick with cold runoff; the junction behind you is a black mouth breathing chemical bite.

Pritchard crawls faster despite the squeeze, voice thin: “There’s a grate ahead—smaller. Might be into the laundromat basement sump. If it’s locked—” He pats his belt like he’s looking for tools he doesn’t have.

Somewhere above, muffled through layers of brick and ductwork, a door buzzer stutters—street level—like the city is still pretending this is normal.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Main chute: gas introduced  
- Side passage: cleaner air, tighter

### Turn 110 [PLAYER]

I whisper to Pritchard, “Hold—let me check the grate before you wedge yourself in.” I crawl up to it, feel for a latch/bolts and test it with a gentle push, then set the wrench on the bars to try a controlled pry—no jerking—listening for any voices or footsteps on the other side. If it won’t give in a few seconds, I pull back and hiss, “Any other route—pipe run, access panel, anything—before we choke in here?”

*Agent reasoning: Gas is creeping in; we need an exit fast. The grate could be locked, so I should assess it quietly and use the wrench as leverage. I also want to avoid getting trapped if it’s a dead end.*

### Turn 111 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** The grate isn’t latched—it’s **bolted** from your side with two rust-fat carriage bolts and a backing plate. Your gentle push confirms it won’t swing. When you lay the wrench across the bars and apply slow pry pressure, metal complains in a low, controlled groan… and then the **rust gives a millimeter**. Not enough to open, but enough to tell you it *can* be forced—at the cost of noise.

You stop before the sound carries.

You press your ear close. On the other side: a hollow, damp room—water drip, a faint motor hum like an old sump pump. Then, closer than you’d like, a **shoe scuffs** and a man mutters, bored and tired: “Smells like bleach down here. You sure this ties out?” Another voice answers, muffled, professional: “Doesn’t matter. Cover the exits.”

Pritchard’s breathing turns sharp. “They’re in the laundromat basement,” he whispers. “Or the service pit under it.”

Behind you, from the junction with the main chute, the chemical edge is stronger now—thin and biting, creeping into the side passage like it’s looking for lungs. Not a full flood yet, but it’s coming.

You pull back and hiss, “Any other route—pipe run, access panel, anything—before we choke in here?”

Pritchard points with two fingers, shaking. “Pipe chase. Above—right wall. There’s an access panel—sheet metal, four screws. It runs up toward the laundry room stacks. But it’s tight—real tight. And if they’re in the basement on the other side of that grate, forcing it might put us face-to-face.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re crouched in the narrow concrete side passage, grate directly ahead; the air tastes faintly of bleach and something sharper bleeding in from behind.

### Turn 112 [PLAYER]

I grab Pritchard’s sleeve. “Pipe chase. Now—quiet.” I climb up to the access panel, use the cable cutters to bite and twist at the screws/edges to peel it open as silently as I can, then motion him in first; before I follow, I ease the panel back into place enough to hide the opening and slow any gas.

*Agent reasoning: Forcing the grate risks immediate contact and noise, and gas is creeping in—pipe chase gives us a vertical escape route with less chance of walking into their line of sight. I need to move fast but controlled, and keep Pritchard from panicking.*

### Turn 113 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You get the panel open—quiet enough that the voices beyond the grate don’t spike, but not silent. The cable cutters bite the soft screw heads and you twist until one gives with a tiny *tick*. The second fights; you lever the edge instead, peeling sheet metal just enough to slip a hand in and bow it outward. It flexes with a muted *ping* that makes Pritchard freeze.

You clamp his sleeve and shove him up first. He wedges shoulders into the pipe chase, grunting soundlessly as he turns sideways and disappears into the dark, boots scraping once against metal. You follow, wrench tucked tight, and before your legs leave the passage you ease the panel back—crooked, not seated, but close enough to **mask the gap** and **slow the chemical creep**.

From below, in the side passage, the gas taste dulls—still there, but less hungry.

Inside the chase, Pritchard whispers from above you, breath hot and panicked: “This goes up. I can feel warm air—laundry vents. If they’re covering exits, they’ll check for drafts.” He pauses, then adds, almost to himself: “Union cadence… that means somebody paid twice.”

On the other side of the grate, one of the basement men shifts closer. A flashlight beam slides under the grate’s bottom edge, probing the floor. “Hold up,” the bored one mutters. “Thought I heard metal.”

The professional voice answers, calm: “Probably settling. Stay on it.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re now in a tight vertical pipe chase above the coal-jog passage, shoulders brushing cold pipes; below, the half-seated panel hides the opening like a bad lie.

Marrowline boots reposition somewhere in the basement beyond the grate; their light keeps sweeping. Above you, the chase narrows toward a slatted vent where faint, humid air pulses—warm, detergent-sweet—like a lung.

### Turn 114 [PLAYER]

I freeze and whisper up to Pritchard, “Don’t move—control your breathing.” I inch my head up to the slatted vent and listen for voices or footsteps above, then test one slat with a fingertip for looseness without shifting the whole grille. If it sounds clear, I whisper, “Any other exit up there—access door, ceiling panel—before we pop this vent?”

*Agent reasoning: They heard something and are sweeping; rushing could rattle the pipes or vent slats and give us away. I need to find where the chase exits and whether the vent opens into a room with people before committing, and keep Pritchard from panicking and making noise.*

### Turn 115 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You and Pritchard go statue-still. The scraping and breathing settle into something a flashlight beam can’t catch.

You inch your head up until your forehead almost kisses the slatted vent. Warm, damp air pulses through it—detergent and hot lint. You listen. Above: a low industrial hum, the distant clack of a dryer drum, and—closer—**footsteps on tile**, slow and unhurried, like someone doing a sweep without expecting trouble. A keyring jingles once.

You touch a single slat with a fingertip. It has a hair of play, but the grille is held by **two screws** on the frame; the slats themselves won’t pop free without flexing the whole face.

Down below, the basement voice near the grate shifts again. “I’m telling you, I heard—” The professional cuts him off: “Then stop talking and listen.”

Pritchard whispers back from above you, barely moving his lips: “There’s a **junction box** two feet above the vent—old service access. If we can reach it, it opens into the **laundry room wall cavity**, not the floor. Safer than popping the vent into a room with feet.”

He swallows, then adds, voice tight: “But it’ll take a tool to turn the latch—coin slot style. Wrench might do it if you can get leverage without ringing the pipes.”

A faint radio squawk bleeds through the building somewhere—Marrowline cadence, clipped codes—then cuts out. The footsteps above pause, like the person heard it too.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re wedged in the vertical pipe chase, vent at your eye-line, pipes cold against your shoulder blades; above the grille, warm laundry air breathes through dust.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Vent: secured by screws  
- Footsteps: overhead sweep nearby

### Turn 116 [PLAYER]

I hold still until the footsteps move off, then whisper to Pritchard, “On my count—slow, no scraping.” I reach up to the junction box and use the wrench gently in the coin-slot latch, applying steady pressure to turn it without clanging the pipes; if it gives, I crack it just enough to peek into the wall cavity before waving Pritchard through.

*Agent reasoning: The vent is risky with someone sweeping overhead; the junction box sounds like a quieter, less exposed exit. I need to wait out the footsteps, then use the wrench with minimal noise and get into the wall cavity.*

### Turn 117 [GAME]

The footsteps above drift away—tile squeak fading into the laundry hum. You count with two fingers, slow, and Pritchard matches you—no scraping, no panic-breath.

You reach up to the junction box. The “coin-slot” latch is painted over and gummy with age. You seat the wrench’s flat edge into it and apply steady pressure—no jerk, no clank. The latch resists… then gives with a soft, wet *crk* as the paint seal breaks. The box door swings a fraction on tired hinges.

You crack it just enough to look.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** It’s not an empty wall cavity. Someone’s converted it into a pass-through: a narrow service void with a **bundle of fresh coax** and a **small black splice brick** zip-tied to a stud—Marrowline work, recent. Beyond that, through the thin gap, you can see the backside of laundry room drywall and the faint strobe of a TV reflection. No person in direct line-of-sight—yet.

Pritchard leans close behind you, whispering, “That’s their feed tap. They’re riding the building’s cameras from inside. If Compliance is here, that’s why.”

Down below, the basement voices shift again; a radio chirps once, closer than before, and the professional voice says, “Check the utility runs. Draft’s wrong.”

The chemical edge you’d slowed is still creeping, thin and sour, but the panel’s bought you breathing room.

You angle your head back and give Pritchard a tight wave. He starts to worm upward toward the opening, moving like he’s trying not to exist.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re wedged in the pipe chase, junction box now ajar above the vent; warm laundry air pulses under you while colder, tainted air licks up from below.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Junction box: opened (quiet)

### Turn 118 [PLAYER]

I whisper, “Good eye—don’t touch the tap yet.” I ease into the service void after Pritchard, keeping the junction box mostly shielding us, and listen for anyone in the laundry room while I slide my phone out and snap one quick, no-flash photo of the splice brick. “Pritchard—does this void run to an access door or another junction, or are we forced to break into the room?”

*Agent reasoning: The splice tap is valuable evidence and a tactical threat; but the basement search is tightening, so we need a quiet exit into the service void without exposing ourselves to the laundry room.*

### Turn 119 [GAME]

You slip through the junction opening into the service void behind Pritchard, keeping the box door half-splayed like a shield. He makes room without a word, shoulders tight, eyes darting to every stud bay like they might sprout hands.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Your phone comes out slow. One quick, no-flash shot of the splice brick—clean capture. On the screen: a matte-black module with a Marrowline-style serial sticker partially scraped off, coax in/out, and a second thinner lead that looks like it’s piggybacking power. Evidence, and recent.

You hold still and listen through the drywall. The laundry room is close—muffled dryer thump, a vending machine compressor cycling, and a human presence: **a man’s voice**, low and irritated, talking to someone on an earpiece. “—no, I’m not signing off on a blind spot. Compliance can eat it. If the tap’s live, it stays live.”

A chair leg scrapes. Footsteps cross the room—near the wall you’re inside—then stop. You catch the faint click of a lighter and the stale sweetness of cheap tobacco threading into the void through a seam.

Pritchard whispers, answering your question: “Void runs laterally about twelve feet. There’s a **maintenance access hatch** at the far end—painted metal, usually opens into the **service corridor by the laundry**. But if they’ve staged in the laundry, that corridor might be watched too.” He swallows. “If we punch through the drywall, it’ll sound like a gunshot in here.”

Below and behind you, from the chase, the basement professional voice calls out—closer, sharper: “Utilities. Now.” A flashlight beam briefly knifes up through the crack at the junction box, searching for light leakage.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re crouched in a studded wall void behind the laundry room; drywall is inches from your face, warm air and lint dust sticking to your skin.

### Turn 120 [PLAYER]

I whisper to Pritchard, “We move to the hatch—slow. No drywall, no tap.” I inch along the void toward the maintenance access hatch, pausing to press my ear to the metal and listen for footsteps or voices in the service corridor; if it sounds clear, I start working the hatch open a hair at a time, ready to freeze if it squeals.

*Agent reasoning: Basement search is closing on our entry point, so staying near the junction box is risky. Breaking into the laundry room is loud and puts us face-to-face with an armed/alert tech. The maintenance hatch offers a quieter lateral move; I want to listen first and open it only if the corridor sounds clear.*

### Turn 121 [GAME]

You and Pritchard start the lateral crawl, inching along studs and dust, careful with elbows and belt buckles. The drywall is so close you can feel its paper skin flex when you breathe.

At the far end, the **maintenance access hatch** sits in the void like a dull coin—painted metal with a thin seam and old screws. You press your ear to it.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** The service corridor beyond is *not* empty. You catch **two sets of footsteps**, one heavier, one lighter, stopping near the hatch like they’re checking doors. A woman’s voice—flat, official—murmurs through the metal: “Laundry’s got a live tap. Someone’s been in the walls. I want the corridor locked down until we confirm.”

The heavier voice answers, annoyed and tired: “Marrowline doesn’t own this building. We’re already pushing it.”

A radio clicks. The woman again: “Then push harder. If Vane’s still inside, he’s not leaving through a hallway.”

Pritchard’s eyes meet yours in the dark; he gives the smallest headshake: *not clear.*

You start to test the hatch anyway—just fingertip pressure, hair at a time—then freeze as the seam gives a microscopic *tick*. Not a squeal, but in the corridor the lighter footsteps shift immediately, closer. A flashlight beam washes under the hatch edge from the other side, searching for a gap.

From behind you, back toward the junction opening, a muffled shout rises from below in the pipe chase: “Found disturbance—paint’s cracked!”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re wedged at the end of the service void, ear to cold metal, with corridor voices inches away on the other side.

The corridor pair lingers—listening now, not talking—while the laundry room hum continues like nothing’s wrong.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Corridor: occupied, alert
- Hatch: tested, slight noise

### Turn 122 [PLAYER]

I press my lips to Pritchard’s ear. “Freeze. Don’t breathe loud.”  
I keep my hands off the hatch and listen hard for where the two in the corridor shift—are they posted right on the seam or moving on—then whisper, “If they move off even five steps, we slip the hatch and roll out fast. If not… we may need a noise from the laundry side—something that pulls them away. Any idea how loud that dryer room is?”

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is being checked from the corridor, and the pipe chase behind us is compromised. Opening the hatch risks immediate detection; going back risks running into the search. Best move is to stay still, gather info, and create a controlled distraction only if it buys us a safer opening—possibly timing movement with corridor radio chatter or the laundry tech’s noise.*

### Turn 123 [GAME]

You go statue-still with Pritchard, your mouth at his ear, and even the lint in the void feels loud. You keep your palms off the hatch and just *listen*.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** The two in the corridor don’t move on. They *reposition*—subtle, practiced. The lighter set of steps slides to the hatch seam and stops dead-center over it. The heavier one drifts a pace away, like he’s giving her room to work. The flashlight beam tightens, held low, probing for any change in shadow under the hatch edge.

Through the metal you catch the woman’s breath—controlled—and a tiny sound like a gloved fingertip tracing paint. She murmurs, almost to herself: “Fresh flex. Somebody’s right there.”

Pritchard barely shifts his jaw to answer your whisper. “Dryer room’s loud enough to hide a *normal* noise,” he breathes, “but they’ll hear anything that sounds like a wall or hatch. If the laundry tech is running a dryer cycle, you can get a cover… if you can make it look like it’s his problem.” He swallows, then adds the useful part: “Laundry’s got carts—metal frames. If one goes over, it rings like a bell down the corridor.”

Behind you, back toward the junction opening, the pipe chase search escalates—boots on metal, someone calling, “Up! Up! He’s in the runs!” A flashlight beam flickers through the junction crack again, brighter this time, and the tainted chemical smell thickens, like they’ve opened something down there.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re pinned at the end of the service void, hatch inches from your nose; corridor voices and flashlight spill leak through the seam like pressure.

The woman outside the hatch shifts her weight once—then you hear the faint *tap-tap* of a radio earpiece being adjusted. “Bring the can. If there’s a void, we smoke it.”

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Corridor pair: posted at hatch  
- Pipe chase team: moving upward  
- “Can” mentioned: chemical threat escalating

### Turn 124 [PLAYER]

I whisper to Pritchard, “They’re bringing gas—no more waiting. We go back to the junction, into the laundry side, and make a *laundry* problem.”  
We crawl back fast but quiet; once I’m at the junction crack, I listen for the tech’s position, then nudge the junction door/metal edge to snap a sharp rattle toward the laundry room—like a cart hit the wall—then freeze and wait for footsteps to commit away from the hatch before we move again.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to gas the void, and the hatch is covered, so waiting is worse than risking the laundry side. A diversion in the laundry could pull the corridor pair off the hatch long enough to slip out.*

### Turn 125 [GAME]

You and Pritchard reverse-crawl down the void, faster now—controlled panic, knees and elbows finding the same grooves in the dust. The corridor voices fade behind you; the pipe-chase search noise grows sharper through the junction crack.

At the junction opening you pause, cheek near the split, and listen into the **laundry room**.

The tech is still in there—close to the dryers by the sound of tumbling drums and his voice, now clipped: “—I’m telling you the tap’s stable. If you want it dead, send someone with authority, not—” He cuts off, like he heard something else in his headset.

You hook two fingers on the junction door’s bent edge and give it the smallest, meanest snap you can manage.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** The metal answers with a sharp, ugly *RATTLE-CLACK* that carries like a dropped cart. The laundry tech jolts mid-sentence. A chair scrapes hard. “What the—?” Footsteps rush toward the wall—then stop, right on the other side of the drywall. You hear him exhale through his nose, listening.

Down in the pipe chase, someone barks, “Hold! I heard that—above us!” Boots clatter on the metal ladder rungs.

In the corridor (farther off now), a radio squawks faintly—then the Compliance woman’s voice, sharper: “Check laundry. Now.”

The heavier corridor voice grumbles something you don’t catch, but his boots start moving—committing away from the hatch, toward the laundry end of the corridor. The lighter set—hers—hesitates a beat longer, then follows, faster, like she doesn’t want to lose the scent.

Pritchard’s eyes are wide in the dim. He mouths without sound: *they’re coming here.*

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re crouched inside the pipe chase junction, back in the service void mouth; stale lint and hot dryer air leak through the crack.

The laundry tech’s silhouette shifts behind the wall—he’s close enough that if he puts a hand on the drywall, you’ll hear the paper skin flex. Meanwhile, the pipe-chase team below is climbing, and the corridor pair is converging on laundry—your rattle bought attention, but it also tightened the net.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Corridor pair: moving toward laundry
- Laundry tech: alerted, close
- Pipe-chase team: climbing up

*Triggered: fail_Ing Either Of Us_0_285fd4, secret_Ing Either Of Us_0_f599bc, secret_Ing Either Of Us_1_11216e, guard_Ing Either Of Us_1_2e2123, fail_Ing Either Of Us_1_2d2f6b*

### Turn 126 [PLAYER]

I press close to the drywall and whisper in my most annoyed, normal voice, “Maintenance—your cart just slammed the wall. Open up before you break the conduit.” I nod to Pritchard to be ready, then I ease the junction door wider just enough for us to slip out if the tech moves away or opens the laundry side.

*Agent reasoning: We’re getting boxed in from below and the corridor. The tech is right on the other side, so stealth is about to fail; better to control the encounter by baiting him to open the room side while we slip out fast and blend as “maintenance,” then move away from the hatch area before the corridor pair arrives.*

### Turn 127 [GAME]

Your whisper comes out pitched just right—irritated, bored, like a guy who’s been called down here three times already.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** On the other side of the drywall, the laundry tech snaps back without thinking. “I didn’t slam—” He stops, then lowers his voice. “Maintenance isn’t scheduled.” A beat. Then, quieter and closer: “Who the hell are you?”

You ease the junction door wider by a couple inches. The metal complains with a tiny *tink*—not loud, but in the tight space it feels like a gunshot. The tech shifts his weight away from the wall, cautious now, and you hear him reach for something—keys, maybe, or a radio clipped to his belt.

Down the corridor, boots are closing—two sets—fast. The heavier one barks, “Laundry, on me.” The Compliance woman answers, “If he’s in there, I want him breathing when we pull him out.”

Pritchard tightens behind you, ready to surge if the laundry side opens, but the tech doesn’t open anything yet. He’s buying time, trying to place your voice while he listens to the approaching backup.

Then the tech gives you something useful, low and urgent through the wall: “If you’re not theirs, you picked a bad minute. They’re bringing foggers. They’ve got a splice brick tied into my panel—if they think you’re in the walls, they’ll gas every void in the building.”

A radio chirps right near him—his. He answers it with forced calm: “Yeah—cart hit the wall. Checking conduit.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re still in the service void at the junction crack, drywall inches from your face; warm dryer air leaks through, smelling of detergent and hot lint.

The corridor pair is nearly at the laundry door; the pipe-chase team below is still climbing, metal rungs ringing faintly. The tech has positioned himself *slightly off the wall* now—he’s not opening, but he’s also not calling you out… yet.

### Turn 128 [PLAYER]

I whisper through the drywall, “Elias Vane—PI. I’m not with them. In ten seconds they’re in your doorway; tell them you saw me bolt for the stairwell and that the wall noise was conduit settling—buy us one minute.”  
Then, quieter: “Where’s the nearest *real* exit from this void—back down the chase, or is there a drop into a different service run?” I motion Pritchard to start backing us away from the junction, slow and silent, ready to move the moment the corridor door opens.

*Agent reasoning: Foggers mean we’re out of time; the tech might be leveraged as a distraction if I give him a reason to misdirect Compliance. I need one quick exchange for intel and to cue a diversion, then move before the corridor team enters.*

### Turn 129 [GAME]

You give the name—**Elias Vane**—and the drywall seems to drink the sound.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** The tech goes still for half a heartbeat, then answers in a flat, professional whisper that doesn’t match his earlier panic. “Vane… I know that name. Okay. One minute is expensive.”

The corridor door to laundry bangs open and fluorescent light spills across the floor. The heavier voice fills the room: “Hands where I can see ’em.”

The tech raises his volume just enough to be heard, pitching it like irritation. “Jesus—relax. Cart clipped the wall. Conduit’s old. I thought I saw a guy—hood up—bolt for the **stairwell** by the service corridor. Could’ve been nothing.”

The Compliance woman’s voice cuts in sharp: “You *saw* him or you *thought* you saw him?”

The tech doesn’t flinch. “Saw him. Left shoulder—dark bag strap. He moved fast.”

That detail lands—because you *do* have a bag strap in play. Boots pivot; radio chatter spikes. Someone in the corridor answers, “Stairwell team, move.”

Inside the void, you motion Pritchard back. He starts easing away from the junction, silent, shoulders turned to keep from scraping the studs. You follow, careful not to let the junction door clink again.

Quieter now, the tech leans closer to the wall and gives you the answer you asked for, fast: “Nearest real out? **Back down the pipe chase.** There’s a **drop hatch** into the basement west run—storage cages—about eight feet down the chase, marked with a yellow paint stripe. It sticks sometimes. Kick it *down*, don’t pull.”

As he says it, you hear the pipe-chase climbers below pause—listening—then redirect. A voice echoes up the metal: “Basement team, hold. Corridor’s got eyes on stairwell.”

The one minute is buying you space… but it’s also reshuffling the hunt toward the stairwell you’re *not* using.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You and Pritchard are backing west along the service void away from the junction; dryer heat fades, replaced by colder, damp concrete air.

Marrowline boots and radios churn in the laundry room; the pipe chase below is active but uncertain; somewhere down your route, that yellow-striped hatch is now your nearest promise of daylight—or at least a different kind of dark.

**STATUS UPDATES**

### Turn 130 [PLAYER]

I keep backing with Pritchard toward the pipe chase, whispering, “Yellow stripe—eight feet. Stay off the metal.” When we find the marked hatch, I pause to listen for anyone below in the basement run, then brace and give it a controlled downward kick—just enough to break it loose without a huge bang—and freeze, ready to pull back if voices answer.

*Agent reasoning: The tech bought us seconds, not safety. Gas is coming and the stairwell is now hot, so the yellow-striped drop hatch is our best route. I want to find it quietly and check for ambush before committing.*

### Turn 131 [GAME]

You and Pritchard ease back into the pipe chase, keeping your shoulders off the metal ribs. Eight feet down, you find it: a **yellow paint stripe** slashed across a square hatch plate, the paint cracked like old warning tape.

You stop and listen.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Below, the basement west run is not empty. You catch **two voices**—muffled through concrete and ductwork—arguing close to where the hatch must drop.

“…told you they’d use the walls.”
“Shut up. Compliance said hold west cages until stairwell confirms.”

No footsteps directly under the hatch yet, but they’re in the area, and they’re alert.

You brace, heel set, and give the hatch a controlled downward kick.

The plate **breaks loose** with a restrained *THUNK*—not a bang, but heavy enough to carry. Dust puffs up around your shin. The hatch drops an inch, then hangs—sticking on a warped hinge.

Below, the voices cut off instantly. A beat later: “You hear that?” Then, sharper: “Up!”

A flashlight beam lances up through the crack, a thin white blade that finds your trouser leg and the edge of Pritchard’s boot. It wobbles as the person below shifts position, trying to get an angle.

Behind you, higher up the chase, you hear distant movement—metal rungs singing faintly as someone repositions, not climbing hard, but not gone either. And from the laundry direction, radios spit short bursts—frustrated, overlapping—like the stairwell chase isn’t paying out.

Pritchard’s breath is tight. He leans close enough that you feel his whisper more than hear it: “If they pop that hatch up, we’re in a bottle.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re crouched in the pipe chase at the yellow-striped hatch, dust floating in the thin light line coming up from below.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Drop hatch: loosened, sticking  
- Basement west run: guards alerted  
- Stairwell chase: ongoing diversion

### Turn 132 [PLAYER]

I pull my leg back out of the light and flatten against the side of the chase, tugging Pritchard with me. In a low whisper: “Don’t fight the hatch—let them commit under it.” I flick a small pebble/bolt from the chase down the shaft to clatter farther along the basement run, then we back-crawl up and away from the yellow stripe, slow and silent, looking for the next junction or any side access before they can get hands on the hatch.

*Agent reasoning: The hatch is compromised and the guards below have a light on us; forcing it now risks being grabbed. Better to break their line of sight, misdirect them, and relocate before they can pop it up from below.*

### Turn 133 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You yank your leg out of the flashlight’s slice and press flat to the chase wall, pulling Pritchard into the same shadowed seam. The beam jitters, loses you, then steadies on the hanging hatch like it’s a mouth about to talk.

You flick a tiny bolt/pebble down the shaft. It drops clean, then **clatters hard**—not straight below, but *farther along* the basement run as it ricochets off pipe and concrete.

The reaction is immediate. Below, one of the basement voices snaps, “There—by the cages!” Footsteps rush away from directly under the hatch, the flashlight beam swinging off to chase the sound. The other voice stays closer, uncertain: “Keep eyes up—don’t get played.”

You and Pritchard start the back-crawl upward, slow, elbows and knees placed like you’re moving across glass. Behind you, the hatch shifts—metal complaining as someone gives it a tentative push from below—but they don’t have a clean angle anymore, and they’re split.

About ten feet up, you find a **side access panel**—a narrow service cutout with a slotted screw head and a thin draft leaking through. Not a full door, but it’s *something* that leads out of the chase into the building’s bones.

From above, faint rung-noise returns—someone repositioning in the chase network, not sprinting, but searching with patience. Over the radio somewhere distant, the stairwell diversion is souring: “Negative contact—stairwell clear,” followed by a tight, angry, “Then he’s still in the walls.”

Pritchard whispers, barely air: “They’re learning.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re higher in the pipe chase now, shoulder against cold metal, dust in your teeth; below, the flashlight beam is no longer cutting up at you—at least for the moment.

### Turn 134 [PLAYER]

I press my ear near the side access panel seam and listen for voices or footsteps on the other side, then whisper to Pritchard, “If this pops loud, we freeze—no running.” I slip a flat edge (nail/coin/any scrap) into the slotted screw and start turning it slow, pausing after each quarter-turn to listen, ready to abandon it if I hear anyone closing in.

*Agent reasoning: The pipe chase is getting boxed in from above and below, so I need an alternate route. The side access panel might lead to a quieter service run, but opening it could make noise or be alarmed—I'll scout and listen first, then open it carefully while keeping Pritchard ready.*

### Turn 135 [GAME]

You put your ear to the seam. The panel breathes out a thin, cold draft that smells like **mop water and old bleach**—not basement funk. On the other side, you catch the faintest hum of fluorescents and, closer, a soft *click…click…click* like a pen being worked by nervous fingers.

A woman’s voice, low and annoyed, comes through the metal—close enough that she’s probably in the corridor just outside the panel: “—I don’t care what stairwell says. The splice brick was photographed. Find the PI.”

Pritchard tenses at your whisper, but he nods once, jaw tight: freeze, don’t run.

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You slip a flat scrap into the slotted screw and begin turning it a quarter at a time. The screw **moves**, but it’s gritty—paint and rust fighting you. Each quarter-turn makes a tiny *skritch* that feels loud in the chase.

You pause. Listen.

Footsteps pass by on the other side—slow, deliberate. The pen-clicking stops. The same woman: “Hold up.” A beat, then: “You hear that? In the wall.”

Your next quarter-turn is slower, but the screw gives a sharper *tick* as it breaks through a paint ridge.

Silence outside. Then a radio whisper, very close: “I’m at the chase line. Possible contact.”

A shadow crosses under the seam—someone crouching to look at the base of the panel. A flashlight doesn’t come on yet; they’re listening first, trying not to give themselves away.

Below you, the hatch you loosened groans again—someone testing it with more confidence now. Above, that faint rung-noise stops, like whoever’s up there is also listening to the wall.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re wedged high in the pipe chase, cheek to cold metal, the side access panel inches from your nose; corridor light leaks in a thin line at the seam.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Side panel screw: partially loosened  
- Corridor: listener crouched outside  
- Basement hatch: being forced slowly

I stop turning immediately and hold perfectly still, one hand clamped over the screw head to keep it from ticking. In a breath-thin whisper to Pritchard: “No motion—count to ten.” Then I lightly tap the pipe beside us twice, spaced out, like thermal knock—trying to sell “settling” rather than a person—while keeping my body flat and silent.

*Agent reasoning: They’re listening right outside the panel; any more screw noise gives me away. I need them to commit elsewhere and buy seconds without moving fast or making obvious sounds.*

### Turn 138 [PLAYER]

I freeze instantly, pinning my hand over the screw head so it can’t tick. In a breath-thin whisper to Pritchard: “No motion—count to ten.” I give the pipe beside us two light, spaced taps—like heat-settling—then go completely still and listen for the crouched listener to move on.

*Agent reasoning: The game seems to have hiccuped; I’ll repeat my last intended action cleanly and keep it cautious and quiet.*

### Turn 139 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You stop dead, palm clamped over the screw head. The metal holds—no tick, no scrape. Pritchard goes statue-still beside you, his breath caught halfway like it hurts.

You give the pipe two light taps, spaced out. The sound travels oddly in the chase—more *structure* than *signal*. Outside the panel, the crouched listener doesn’t move for a long beat.

Then the woman’s voice, right on the seam, softer now—more certain than before: “Building’s talking. Old pipes. Don’t spook yourselves.”

A second voice—male, heavier—answers from a step back: “Pipes don’t tap twice like that.”

She pauses. You can almost hear her recalibrating. “Yeah,” she admits, and the pen-click starts again, faster. “But if someone’s in there, they’re pinned. Get a mirror on the seam. No lights.”

Something thin slides along the bottom edge of the panel from the corridor side—metal on metal, careful. Not prying; *feeling* for airflow, for movement. Whoever it is knows this game.

Down below, the hatch you baited groans again—this time with a sharper, confident shove. A muffled curse follows, then: “It’s loose. He’s above.”

And somewhere farther off in the building, a radio squawks a clipped update: “Stairwell negative. Sweep is converging basement west.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re still wedged in the pipe chase, face inches from the side access panel seam; corridor light is a thin knife under your hand, and the air tastes like bleach and dust.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Corridor listener: not fooled, probing  
- Mirror sweep: being set up  
- Basement hatch: nearly forced open

### Turn 140 [PLAYER]

I lean to Pritchard’s ear, barely moving my lips: “Back—now. Slow.” We back-crawl up and away from the panel and the yellow-striped hatch, keeping low and silent, heading for the next junction or vertical rise where we can change level and put distance between us and that seam.

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to confirm us with a mirror at the seam, and the hatch below is nearly open. The side panel is compromised, so the safest move is to retreat deeper into the chase to break line-of-sight and avoid being pinned between two entry points.*

### Turn 141 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You and Pritchard start the back-crawl—slow, elbows and knees, keeping your shoulders from brushing the sheet metal. It works: no new scrape from your side, no rattle from the screw you left half-loosened.

Behind you, at the access panel, the probing tool stops. A woman murmurs, close to the seam: “Air changed.” Not loud—just confident. The pen-click dies. “He moved.”

A second later, a faint *snick*—they’ve set a small mirror or polished sliver at the seam. No flashlight yet, but you can feel the corridor presence tighten, like a dog catching scent.

You make it to the next junction—where the pipe chase widens around a cross-brace and rises into a narrow vertical run with ladder rungs welded into the wall. Pritchard’s hand finds your ankle for a second—steadying, not stopping—then he mouths without sound: *Up?*

Down below, the yellow-striped drop hatch gives a hard, final groan and then a dull *thump* as it shifts—someone’s shoulder finally buying space. A male voice from below, muffled: “I’m in. Watch the walls.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re now a few body-lengths back from the side access panel, tucked in the wider junction; the metal here is warmer, and the air is less bleach, more dust and old insulation.

**MULTIPLE ACTIVE THREADS:** The corridor team is now working the seam with patience and tools; the basement team has breached the lower hatch and is climbing into the chase; and above you, the vertical run offers a level change—but it’s tight, and any fast movement will ring the rungs like a bell.

Pritchard keeps his face turned toward the vertical, eyes hard, breathing through his nose—trying to be silent and ready to move when you commit.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Corridor team: tracking movement  
- Basement hatch: breached, entry begun  
- You/Pritchard: reached vertical junction

### Turn 142 [PLAYER]

I nod once to Pritchard and whisper, “Up—one rung at a time. Three rungs, stop, listen.” I ease onto the vertical rungs, testing each weld with my weight before shifting, and pause after the third rung to listen for any movement or a grate/exit above.

*Agent reasoning: They’ve got us triangulated—corridor team on the seam and a basement entry coming up. The vertical run is risky but it’s the only way to change the geometry and buy time; we’ll climb slow to avoid ringing the rungs, and I want to know what’s above before committing fully.*

### Turn 143 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You take the vertical like it’s a church ladder—one weld at a time, weight-tested, no hurry. The first rung holds with a dull, swallowed *tink*. Second rung: quieter. Third rung: you stop and lock yourself to the wall, breathing through your teeth. Pritchard follows exactly, keeping a rung’s distance so the metal doesn’t sing.

In the pause, the building talks back.

Above you: a faint draft, cooler and drier, leaking through a grille or vent run—close, but not directly overhead. You also catch a soft, periodic *click…click…* that isn’t pipe-settling. It’s plastic-on-metal: someone’s zip-tie bundle, or a key fob tapping a belt clip—meaning there’s a person up-level, not just empty duct.

Below you: the newly-breached hatch coughs a scrape as someone shoulders into the chase. A man’s voice, low and irritated, echoes upward: “Keep it dark. He’ll try to climb.”

At the side panel back the way you came, the corridor woman calls in a quiet, controlled tone—like she’s reading a room: “He’s going vertical. Cut him off above the junction.”

Pritchard leans close enough that you feel his breath on your collar and murmurs, barely audible: “They know. But they don’t know *where* the rise comes out.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re three rungs up in a narrow vertical run; the metal is warmer here, and the air carries a dry, dusty draft from somewhere above-left.

**MULTIPLE ACTIVE THREADS:** The corridor team is shifting to containment—voices moving away from the seam and into the building proper. The basement entry is now inside the chase and climbing after you. And above, that faint draft and belt-clip click suggest an upper-level presence near an exit point—maybe a maintenance grate, maybe a service void interface.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Vertical ascent begun; silent
- Basement team climbing into chase
- Corridor team redirecting to cut-off

### Turn 144 [PLAYER]

I freeze on the rung and whisper to Pritchard, “Hold. No more climbing.” I angle my head toward the cooler draft and quietly probe above-left with my fingertips for a seam, junction, or grille frame we can slip through; if I find one, I whisper, “Exit left—maybe,” and we wait, listening for that belt-clip click to get closer or move away.

*Agent reasoning: There’s someone above near an exit, and a team climbing up behind us. I need intel before committing—find where the draft leads and whether there’s a side cutout to avoid an ambush.*

### Turn 145 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** You freeze and Pritchard freezes with you—no extra rung, no shifting weight. The chase goes dead quiet except for distant building hum.

You reach above-left with two fingers, moving like you’re reading Braille. After a few inches of smooth duct wall you find it: a rectangular grille frame set into the side of the vertical run, its edge packed with dust and a thin gasket. The cool draft is coming through it. The frame has two slotted screws—old, slightly rounded—meant to be serviced from *your* side. You whisper, “Exit left—maybe,” and Pritchard’s eyes cut to the screws, then back down the shaft.

The belt-clip click above shifts—closer by a step, then stops. A voice, muted through metal, says to someone nearby: “He’s in the rise. Don’t lean on it—listen.” Not Marrowline-polite. More like a building tech who’s done ugly work before.

Below, the climber in the chase bumps a rung—just once—and catches himself. You hear a controlled exhale, then a low mutter: “He stopped. He’s waiting.”

From the corridor side (farther away now), the woman’s voice floats faintly, talking into a radio: “He found the draft. He’ll try the vent. If you’ve got eyes on laundry ceiling, hold them.”

Pritchard leans in until his mouth is near your ear, barely a breath: “Laundry ceiling… that’s above the second-floor staging. If that grille dumps there, it’s not outside. It’s *busier*.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** Three rungs up in the vertical run; your fingertips rest on a dust-caked grille frame above-left, cold air slipping through like it’s been waiting.

**MULTIPLE ACTIVE THREADS:** Someone up-level is now listening for you rather than moving; the basement climber is inside the same shaft, careful but closing; and the corridor team is coordinating coverage of a likely exit point—“laundry ceiling”—which suggests this vent ties back into the building’s service spaces, not the street.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Grille located: serviceable from inside  
- Upper-level listener: holding position  
- Basement climber: advancing slowly

*Triggered: fail_Ing Either Of Us_0_285fd4, secret_Ing Either Of Us_0_f599bc, secret_Ing Either Of Us_1_11216e, guard_Ing Either Of Us_1_2e2123, fail_Ing Either Of Us_1_2d2f6b*

### Turn 146 [PLAYER]

I whisper to Pritchard, “Don’t touch the rungs—brace on the wall. I’m checking airflow.” I put my ear close to the grille, then slowly slide a thin edge of my notebook cover (or any flat scrap I can reach) along the frame to feel for a latch or looseness without turning the screws; if I hear voices or footsteps on the other side, I freeze and mouth, “Covered,” and wait for the upper listener to move first.

*Agent reasoning: The vent is a likely exit but it’s covered and probably leads into a staffed area; rushing it could put us right into their hands. I want more intel and to avoid making noise while the basement climber closes in, so I’ll try to quietly learn what’s beyond the grille and only commit if it’s clear.*

### Turn 147 [GAME]

**IMMEDIATE OUTCOME:** Pritchard shifts his palms off the rungs and flattens himself to the chase wall, boots braced—good discipline. You lean your ear to the grille. The airflow is steady, not a fan pulse: passive draft, which means the other side is a larger void, not a narrow duct.

You slide the thin edge of your notebook cover along the frame, slow and delicate. No spring latch. The frame is seated on a gasket and held by those two slotted screws—*but* the lower-right corner has a hair of play, like it’s been removed recently and put back in a hurry. Enough that you could flex it a millimeter… not enough to pop it without tools or noise.

On the other side: fabric rustle, then the soft *tick* again—belt clip, close. A man clears his throat like he’s trying not to. Then, right over your ear through the grille, a low voice: “He’s right here.” Not shouted—spoken to someone in the room.

You freeze instantly, mouth “Covered,” and hold. Pritchard’s eyes harden; he doesn’t move, but his hand drifts toward his belt like he’s remembering he doesn’t have a gun in a ventilation shaft.

A second voice answers farther away, female, impatient: “Don’t open it. Flood it.” There’s a pause. “Compliance wants him breathing.”

Below you, the basement climber stops climbing. You hear him listen, then whisper up to his partner: “He’s at the side vent. Don’t rush.”

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re still three rungs up in the vertical run, cheek nearly touching a dust-packed grille; cold air slides over your lips, tasting faintly of detergent and hot metal.

**MULTIPLE ACTIVE THREADS:** Up-level, at least two people have you located by ear and draft. Below, the climber is now holding position, coordinating instead of chasing. And somewhere in the building proper, that “Compliance” mention suggests this isn’t just muscle—there’s a procedural plan forming, the kind that uses gas, smoke, or pressure rather than a straight grab.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Grille: no latch; slight play  
- Upper team: confirmed your position  
- “Flood it” order issued

*Triggered: secret_Ing Either Of Us_0_f599bc, secret_Ing Either Of Us_1_11216e, guard_Ing Either Of Us_1_2e2123, fail_Ing Either Of Us_1_2d2f6b, guard_Ward The Cooler Draft And_1_2cc887*

### Turn 148 [PLAYER]

I whisper to Pritchard, “Flood means gas—move now, quiet.” I ease back from the grille and climb up two rungs, then pause, listening hard for any hiss, canister clink, or pressure change from above; if I hear nothing immediate, I keep climbing—slow, controlled—aiming to reach the next junction before they start pumping anything.

*Agent reasoning: They’ve got my exact position and are planning to “flood” the shaft—likely gas or smoke. Staying here is death by inches, but rushing the grille will make noise. Best move: get off this vent line, create distance vertically, and force them to guess again; communicate quietly with Pritchard and listen for any hiss/valve cues.*

### Turn 149 [GAME]

You ease off the grille like it’s wired to an alarm and climb—two rungs, careful, no metal song. Pritchard mirrors you, palms on the wall, boots finding purchase on the ladder rails without scraping.

You stop and listen.

At first: nothing but the building’s low electrical thrum and your own blood in your ears. Then a faint *clink*—metal on metal—followed by the dry *psst* of a valve being cracked, not yet sustained. It’s coming from above-left, where the grille feeds. They’re not flooding the whole chase; they’re trying to push something *through that opening* and let the draft do the work.

Up above, the belt-clip man barks, muffled: “Not in the room—into the vent. Slow. We want him moving, not dead.” The female voice answers, colder: “Then keep it light. If he panics, he drops.”

Below you, the climber shifts again—one rung up, then stops, like he heard the valve too and decided to let chemistry do the chasing. You catch a soft radio whisper from somewhere distant: “Laundry ceiling team, stand by. If he blows past, don’t engage alone.”

You keep climbing, slow-controlled, aiming for the next widened junction—where the chase opens enough to turn, or at least where another access panel might exist. The air is still mostly clean, but the draft now carries a new edge: sharp, sterile, like aerosol propellant and cheap disinfectant.

**SENSORY GROUNDING:** You’re now five rungs up in the vertical run; the metal here is cooler, and the draft brushes your knuckles with that faint chemical bite.

**ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT:** The “flood” is starting as a targeted vent feed. You’ve got a narrow window before the draft pulls it fully into your shaft—and before the man below decides to climb aggressively.

**STATUS UPDATES**
- Gas feed: initiated (light)  
- Upper team: vent-injection confirmed  
- Basement climber: holding, listening

### Turn 150 [PLAYER]

I whisper to Pritchard, “Keep climbing—don’t stop unless I tap twice.” I pull my collar up over my nose and mouth and continue up, one rung at a time, scanning for the next side seam or access panel; if the chemical bite gets stronger, I tap Pritchard twice and angle my body to the wall to minimize breathing it in.

*Agent reasoning: They’re feeding aerosol into the vent; staying in this vertical run will turn it into a chimney. I need a junction or alternate exit fast, but I can’t sprint or we’ll ring the rungs. I’ll keep moving up while watching for any side access, and I’ll prep something to cover my mouth if the irritant hits.*

### Turn 151 [GAME]

You give Pritchard the rule, and he nods once—no words, just that tight, veteran compliance. Collar up, you climb.

**Immediate outcome:** you gain height, and you find what you were hunting for—an access seam before the air turns fully against you.

Six rungs up, the shaft widens at a cross-braced junction: the ladder rungs give way to a small standing pocket where pipes split and rejoin, and the metal panels change pattern. On your right, a vertical seam with a slotted head fastener—newer than the others, less dust, like it’s been opened in the last day. Above it, a yellow paint stripe marks a drop hatch line, the kind maintenance uses to isolate sections.

The chemical bite strengthens—sharp in the back of your throat even through cloth. Not choking yet, but it’s starting to ride the draft in a steady stream. You tap Pritchard twice. He immediately angles his body to the wall like you taught him, breathing shallow. His whisper is barely audible: “They’re dosing it. Light now—heavier if we stall.”

From below, the climber finally commits: a quick, controlled ascent—two rungs, three—trying to close the distance before the irritant does the work. You hear him call up softly, not friendly: “Hold still, Vane. Compliance wants you alive.”

Above-left, through ductwork, the belt-clip man’s voice is closer and more confident now: “He’s past the grille. He’ll hit the junction.” A radio chirps; the woman answers, “Good. Keep feeding. Laundry team, eyes up—he’s going to pop somewhere.”

**Sensory grounding:** you’re in the widened junction pocket of the vertical pipe chase, metal cross-brace pressing cold into your shoulder, air tasting like aerosol cleaner and hot dust.

**Environmental context:** the gas is being pushed into the vent line and the draft is carrying it up toward you; stopping here will let it pool in your breathing space, and the man below is using the moment to gain ground.

- Reached widened junction pocket
- Access seam located (right panel)

### Turn 152 [PLAYER]

I press my ear to the right-side seam for a second, then slide my notebook edge under the slotted fastener and try to twist it just enough to loosen—slow, no metal scrape. “Pritchard, back-to-wall and watch below—tell me the second he’s within arm’s reach,” I whisper, and if the fastener gives, I ease the panel open a crack and sniff-test the air beyond before committing.

*Agent reasoning: Gas is coming up and someone’s climbing fast from below; the junction panel looks recently used and is my best quiet exit. I need to open it without tools if possible and get us out before the irritant ramps up.*

### Turn 153 [GAME]

You press your ear to the right-side seam. For half a second it’s just the thin whistle of draft—then you catch something else: a softer, warmer airflow on the other side, and a muffled *machine hum* that isn’t coming through the chase. Different space. Different ventilation.

You slide the stiff edge of your notebook under the slotted fastener and start to turn—slow, using pressure instead of torque so it doesn’t squeal. The screw gives a reluctant quarter turn with a gritty feel, like it’s been overpainted. No sharp scrape, but the metal complains in a dull *tick*.

Pritchard flattens back-to-wall and leans to look down the ladder well. “He’s climbing,” he whispers, voice tight. “Not sprinting—steady. Ten feet… eight…”

You keep the notebook edge in the slot and work another fraction. The fastener loosens enough that the panel’s corner lifts when you put a fingertip to it. You ease it open a crack—just a black line at first—then a thin wedge.

The air beyond is cleaner. Cooler. It smells like old plaster and stale coffee more than chemicals. Good sign: whatever they’re feeding is staying largely in the chase.

From above-left, the irritant’s bite sharpens again—your eyes start to sting at the edges. Somewhere beyond the grille, the woman’s voice snaps: “Increase it. He’s hunting a side exit.”

Pritchard’s whisper cuts in, urgent: “Within arm’s reach in three… two—”

The climber below shifts his weight for the last pull-up; you hear his glove squeak on rung.

**Sensory grounding:** You’re braced in the widened junction pocket, right shoulder against a cold cross-brace, panel on your right cracked open to a darker void that breathes cleaner air.

**Environmental context:** The dose is ramping up; if they push harder, your eyes and lungs will start to fail you even through cloth—while the man below is seconds from grabbing your ankle.

**Status updates**
- Right panel fastener: loosened  
- Panel: cracked open (cleaner air)  
- Irritant feed: increasing  
- Basement climber: arm’s reach imminent

### Turn 154 [PLAYER]

“Now, Pry—block him,” I hiss. I shove the panel wider with my shoulder and squeeze through the gap into the cleaner space, keeping low and quiet; as I go, I kick the panel back toward closed behind me to slow their reach and muffle the chase.

*Agent reasoning: The gas is increasing and the climber is about to grab me; the cracked panel leads to cleaner air, so I should slip through now while using Pritchard to delay and avoid a struggle in the shaft.*

### Turn 155 [GAME]

Pritchard moves the instant you hiss it—boots lock on the rungs, shoulders squared to the shaft. The climber’s hand comes up for your ankle and finds Pritchard’s forearm instead. There’s a muffled grunt, a scuffle of rubber on metal, and Pritchard drives his weight down and in, jamming the man’s climb and forcing him to hang awkwardly on one arm.

You shove the panel wider with your shoulder and slip through.

**Immediate outcome:** you make it into the adjacent space cleanly; the panel swings back toward closed behind you with your kick, cutting the draft and dulling the chase noise to a far-off, metallic argument.

On the other side is a narrow service void—more wall than room—running parallel to the chase. It’s dry, dusty, and warmer, with bundled cable strapped along studs and a thin strip of old acoustic insulation hanging like dead skin. Your collar drops a fraction and the air doesn’t bite back.

Behind the panel, you hear Pritchard through the metal, strained but controlled: “Vane—go. He’s got a partner below.” The climber hisses something into a radio—“He slipped into the side void”—and you catch the reply faintly through the panel: “Laundry team, cut him off. He’s in the wall.”

Down the void, a dim maintenance glow leaks from a grated opening the size of a briefcase—an old return vent into a corridor or utility room. Past that, the void angles and you can see a second access point: a square hatch with a simple latch, the kind a building super uses, not Marrowline.

Somewhere above, the irritant feed continues, but it’s now mostly on the other side of your panel. You still feel time pressure: if they realize this void exists, they’ll start opening wall points instead of chasing the shaft.

**Status updates**

### Turn 156 [PLAYER]

I creep to the grated opening and peer through, listening for boots or radios on the other side; if it’s clear, I whisper, “Pritchard—service void. If you can break contact, follow the wall and find the square hatch.” Then I slide to the square hatch and test the latch gently, ready to freeze if I hear anyone closing in.

*Agent reasoning: Pritchard’s buying me seconds, not minutes. I need a quiet exit that won’t dump me into the corridor right in front of “Laundry team,” so I’ll scout through the grated vent first, then take the hatch if it looks safer.*

### Turn 157 [GAME]

You creep up to the grated opening and put your eye to it.

**Immediate outcome:** the space beyond isn’t empty—and it isn’t Marrowline’s uniformed patrol, either.

You’re looking into a dim service corridor/utility run: painted cinderblock, conduit, and a mop sink. A single maintenance bulb buzzes. Two figures are there, half-hidden by stacked folding chairs and a rolling laundry cart. One of them has a small headset mic and a tablet glow under his palm; the other’s posture is all shoulders—hands free, watching the corridor like a bouncer.

You don’t hear heavy boots rushing—yet—but you do catch a low radio murmur from somewhere farther down: “—he’s in the wall. Check returns. Check hatches.” The voices are closer than you’d like, drifting toward your side of the building.

You whisper through the panel seam, keeping it tight: “Pritchard—service void. If you can break contact, follow the wall and find the square hatch.”

A beat later, Pritchard’s voice comes back, muffled through metal, breath clipped like he’s bracing: “Copy. He’s got me tied up—give me ten seconds. If you hear a bang, don’t wait.”

You slide down the void to the square hatch. Dust smears your fingers. The latch is simple, but it’s been “discouraged”—a thin loop of wire twisted through the hasp, not welded, not permanent. Someone wanted it delayed, not sealed.

As you test it gently, the wire gives a faint *tink*—small, but in a quiet void it sounds huge. You freeze.

On the other side of the grated opening, the headset guy tilts his head, listening. He murmurs to his partner, “Hear that? Wall side.” The heavy shifts his weight, wheels the laundry cart a few inches, and the cart’s squeak lines up with the return vent—like they’re triangulating you.

**Sensory grounding:** you’re crouched in the narrow service void, square hatch at your knees, return vent behind you leaking a dirty yellow light.

**Environmental context:** Marrowline’s cut-off team is already staged; if they commit to opening the vent or popping wall panels, this void turns into a trap fast.

### Turn 158 [PLAYER]

I stay frozen for a beat, then slowly pinch the wire loop and twist it back on itself to unthread it without snapping—breathing shallow. As soon as it’s free, I ease the latch open and slip through the hatch, pulling it mostly closed behind me; under my breath into the panel seam: “Pritchard—hatch is clear. Break and follow, now.”

*Agent reasoning: They’ve triangulated the sound—if I fumble the wire louder, they’ll open the vent and pin me. Best move is a silent exit through the hatch while they’re still deciding, and give Pritchard a clear cue to disengage and follow.*

### Turn 159 [GAME]

The wire comes free without the sharp *ping* you were afraid of—just a soft metallic whisper as you unwind it and pocket the slack in your palm. You ease the latch up, lift the hatch a hair at a time, and slip through sideways.

**Immediate outcome:** you clear the hatch cleanly and get it mostly closed behind you before the cut-off team commits to the vent.

You land in a cramped maintenance cavity between studs—then it opens into a shallow janitor’s annex: a concrete closet with a slop sink, a stack of chemical jugs, and a narrow door that leads out into the same utility corridor you saw through the grate. The air here is neutral, just damp cement and bleach.

As you pull the hatch nearly shut, you murmur into the seam, “Pritchard—hatch is clear. Break and follow, now.”

Through the thin wall, the headset tech’s voice rises, closer now, irritated: “Return vent’s warm. He’s not in the chase anymore.” The heavy answers in a low rumble, “Then he’s in this pocket. Pop it.”

A cart wheel squeaks again—right outside your annex door—and a flashlight beam knifes under the door gap, sweeping left to right like a slow metronome. The tech adds, almost casual: “Compliance wants him breathing. Not pretty—breathing.”

From somewhere deeper behind you—faint through framing—you hear a sudden *clang* and a strangled grunt: Pritchard breaking contact, or trying to. The climber barks, “He went through—after him!” and boots start hammering ladder rungs.

**Environmental context:** you’re out of the irritant stream for the moment, but you’re boxed in by thin doors and thin walls; the cut-off team is seconds from checking this annex, and the chase is about to spill into the same network of hatches.

### Turn 160 [PLAYER]

I scan the annex fast for a second exit—ceiling panel, back wall access, or floor drain cover—then kill my breathing and press flat beside the door hinge side, out of the sweep line. If there’s no exit, I quietly uncap one of the harshest-smelling jugs and dribble a thin line across the floor at the threshold to make the room reek and slippery, then whisper into the wall, “Pritchard—don’t come through the door. Find the hatch; I’ll mark it.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re right outside the door with a light; opening it is suicide. I need a quieter exit or a way to delay them without making noise, and I want to give Pritchard a clear route to me.*

### Turn 161 [GAME]

You sweep the annex in a single, tight glance.

**Immediate outcome:** there’s no clean second exit—but there *is* a way to buy yourself seconds and make them hesitate.

Above the slop sink is a **ceiling access panel** (painted over, corners cracked) with a faint draft line; it’s reachable if you get a foot on the sink lip. In the back wall, behind the stacked chemical jugs, a **rectangular service plate** sits low—two screws, slightly chewed, like it’s been opened before. The floor drain is a simple grate set in concrete; not a cover you’re prying quietly in the next heartbeat.

You kill your breathing and flatten on the hinge side of the door, out of the flashlight’s under-sweep. The beam keeps slicing the gap, but it never finds your shoes.

You twist open the harshest jug—industrial degreaser, lemon-sharp and throat-stripping—and dribble a thin line right at the threshold. The smell blooms fast in the tiny room, chemical and unmistakable. The concrete at the door darkens to a slick sheen.

Outside, the heavy mutters, “Smells like a janitor’s closet.” The tech answers, “Yeah. That’s the point. He’s in there or he wants us thinking he is.” A pause—then the tech adds, quieter, “No hero stuff. He’s got evidence on him.”

You whisper into the wall, “Pritchard—don’t come through the door. Find the hatch; I’ll mark it.”

From somewhere in the wall/void behind, Pritchard’s voice comes back thin and strained: “On my way—two on me—” then a sharp exhale like he’s moving fast and trying not to cough.

The heavy’s hand finds the knob. You hear the slight click of a latch testing—careful, not kicking. Their flashlight beam steadies, like they’re about to push in slow.

**Sensory grounding:** you’re pressed to cold cinderblock beside the annex door hinges; the degreaser stings your eyes even with your breath held.

**Environmental context:** irritant feed is still active elsewhere; once they commit to the annex, this becomes a close-quarters search with nowhere to backpedal without making noise.

### Turn 162 [PLAYER]

I wait for the knob to start turning, then silently step to the sink, climb up, and ease the ceiling access panel open just enough to slip my fingers in and pull myself up. If I get it open, I slide into the ceiling space and hold the panel nearly flush behind me, keeping still and listening for them entering and slipping on the threshold.

*Agent reasoning: If they open the door, I’m pinned; I need vertical or wall-space before contact. Ceiling access is fastest and keeps me out of their flashlight line, while the degreaser buys a slip/hesitation. I also want to avoid leading them toward Pritchard’s route.*

### Turn 163 [GAME]

The knob starts to turn—slow, testing.

**Immediate outcome:** you make it into the ceiling space, but not perfectly silent.

You peel off the hinge-side wall and glide to the slop sink in two soft steps. One foot on the sink lip, fingers on the painted-over ceiling panel. The panel sticks for half a heartbeat—old paint acting like glue—then gives with a faint *crack* as the seal breaks. Not loud, but in this tight annex it’s a tell.

You hook your fingers into the gap, pull, and lever yourself up into the dark crawl above the ceiling tiles: joists, dusty insulation, and a run of conduit that vibrates with distant footsteps. You ease the panel back down until it sits nearly flush, leaving a hairline slit you can see through.

**Sensory grounding:** you’re belly-down on joists above the janitor’s annex door; the degreaser stench rises through the panel seam and burns your eyes.

Below, the heavy pushes the door inward with his shoulder—careful—then his boot hits your slick line. His foot skates an inch, catches, and he hisses a quiet curse through his teeth. Not a full spill, but enough to spike his pulse. The tech snorts, amused and sharp: “Watch your step. He’s playing.”

The tech’s flashlight sweeps the annex, beam bouncing off the slop sink and chemical jugs. He steps in gingerly, avoiding the threshold, and you hear him key his mic: “He’s not here. Smell’s fresh. Check vertical—ceiling voids, returns.” Then, lower to the heavy: “He’s trying to get us to commit. Don’t.”

The heavy’s head tilts up. The flashlight follows—slowly—toward the ceiling panel you just settled.

From somewhere in the walls behind the annex, you catch a muffled scrape and a breathy grunt—Pritchard moving through a tight space, close enough now that the joists under you pick up the vibration.

**Environmental context:** they’re searching smart now—no rushing, no panicking. The longer you stay above this panel, the more likely they start opening tiles methodically, and you’ll have to move over noisy gridwork and brittle plaster.

**Status updates**
- Ceiling void: occupied, concealed

### Turn 164 [PLAYER]

I stay perfectly still until the flashlight lingers elsewhere, then inch away from the panel along the joists toward the conduit run, moving slow enough not to rattle anything. As I go, I listen hard for where Pritchard is in the wall and whisper under my breath, “Pritchard—hold. Two in the annex looking up. Don’t surface here.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re already thinking “ceiling voids,” so staying over this exact panel is a dead end. I need to move before they start popping tiles, but do it quietly and also avoid leading them straight to Pritchard.*

### Turn 165 [GAME]

You freeze until the flashlight stops worrying the ceiling seam and drifts back down across the jugs and sink. Then you start the slow crawl—palms on joists, knees finding solid wood, easing your weight along the conduit run so nothing rattles.

**Immediate outcome:** you gain distance from the panel without drawing a shout, but the tech clocks *something*—not you, the space.

Below, the tech says, “Hear that? Building’s got a hollow up there.” His tone isn’t excited; it’s procedural. The heavy answers, “Then we don’t stand under it.” You hear his boots shift back toward the doorway, making room.

In the ceiling, dust and old insulation cling to your sleeves. The conduit is cold under your fingertips and faintly buzzing, like it’s carrying a heartbeat from somewhere else in the building. Through the joists you can place Pritchard by sound now: a rasping breath and a careful scrape coming from **behind the back wall service plate area**, moving laterally—he’s in the service void, close but not directly under the annex.

You whisper, barely a mouth-shape: “Pritchard—hold. Two in the annex looking up. Don’t surface here.”

A pause. Then, very faint through the wall cavity: “Copy.” Another breath. “I’m pinned in the void—someone just passed the corridor.”

Down below, the tech keys his mic again: “He’s using ceiling runs. I want eyes in the utility corridor—cut him off at the next access. Don’t climb blind.” The heavy’s reply is a low acknowledgement, and you hear his shoulder brush the doorframe as he backs out to reposition.

The annex door stays partly open. The degreaser stink continues to billow up into your crawlspace, masking your sweat and breath but also making your eyes water—blinking risks a tiny rustle against insulation.

**Environmental context:** they’re transitioning from “search this room” to “contain the network.” That buys you a sliver of time overhead, but it also means more bodies in corridors and more methodical checks of every access plate.

**Status updates**
- Annex team: repositioning outward  
- Pritchard: holding in void

### Turn 166 [PLAYER]

I inch farther along the conduit, feeling for another ceiling panel or vent that opens into a different room or corridor, and pause to listen for any patrol moving to “the next access.” Under my breath into the gap, “Pritchard—can you reach that back wall service plate? If you can, stay put; I’m looking for a separate drop so we’re not surfacing together.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re shifting to containment, so staying near the annex is a losing bet. I need a quieter exit route in the ceiling and a way to coordinate Pritchard toward a different access point without exposing him.*

### Turn 167 [GAME]

You worm farther along the conduit run, distributing your weight over the joists so the metal doesn’t sing. Your fingertips find a seam—then another—until you hit a **rectangular return vent** set into framing, not a tile: heavier, screwed down, and breathing cool air. A few feet beyond that, the joists open over a different ceiling grid; through a hairline you can see **utility corridor fluorescents** and the top edge of a door with a stenciled label: **“ELECTRICAL / AUTH ONLY.”**

**Immediate outcome:** you locate a separate drop point into the utility corridor area, but a patrol is already moving to contain it.

Below and ahead, footsteps come in pairs—measured, not running—closing on the corridor. A radio murmurs through the ceiling: “—next access is electrical door, hold that line—” The sound is close enough you feel it in the wood.

You whisper into the gap, “Pritchard—can you reach that back wall service plate? If you can, stay put; I’m looking for a separate drop so we’re not surfacing together.”

From the wall cavity, Pritchard answers so quietly it’s almost a vibration: “I’m at the plate. Two screws. I can pop it, but corridor’s got bodies—heard ‘em stack up. I’ll hold.”

In the annex behind you, the tech’s voice drifts faintly through the ceiling: “He’s not dumb. He’ll try to drop away from us.” Then, sharper, to someone else: “If you hear ceiling movement, don’t chase—mark it.”

**Sensory grounding:** you’re belly-down above the utility corridor ceiling grid; the air here is cooler, tinged with ozone and old dust, and the fluorescent hum leaks up through the seams.

**Multiple threads moving:** Marrowline is shifting to containment at the electrical door; Pritchard is pinned but positioned at the service plate; and you’ve got an alternate exit that’s mechanically harder (screws/vent) but geographically better.

**Environmental context:** any attempt to open a vent or lift a grid panel risks a telltale rattle; with bodies stacking in the corridor, the first noise becomes a spotlight.

**Status updates**
- Alternate drop located: utility corridor
- Patrols stacking near electrical door
- Pritchard holding at service plate

### Turn 168 [PLAYER]

I stay put above the grid and listen for a headcount and where they’re stacking around the “ELECTRICAL” door, watching for boots stopping under my seam. Whispering toward Pritchard’s wall void: “Hold tight—tell me if you hear them shift off the corridor. If they move, I’ll cue you to pop the plate and slide.”

*Agent reasoning: Dropping into a stacked corridor is suicide; better to gather intel and create a distraction so either Pritchard can slip out via the service plate or I can move to a less-watched exit. I should confirm how many bodies and their positions before committing, then coordinate timing quietly.*

### Turn 169 [GAME]

You go statue-still above the grid, cheek against a joist, eyes on the seam where fluorescent light leaks up like a thin blade.

**Immediate outcome:** you get a clean headcount and their formation—then one of them stops almost directly under you, close enough that any ceiling noise will betray you.

Boots pad into position around the **ELECTRICAL / AUTH ONLY** door: three sets, then a fourth that hangs back. One voice—female, calm, command—murmurs, “Two on the handle side. One on the hinge. One back for overwatch. Nobody touches the door until Compliance clears the panel.” A different voice answers with a throat-clear and a clipped “Copy.”

The overwatch steps to a spot beneath your seam and just…waits. You can hear his breathing and the soft creak of leather as he shifts his weight. He’s not looking up—he’s listening for it. The corridor’s hum and the return air’s pull make your own breath feel loud in your skull.

Through the building’s bones, you whisper toward Pritchard’s void: “Hold tight—tell me if you hear them shift off the corridor. If they move, I’ll cue you to pop the plate and slide.”

A beat later, Pritchard’s voice comes back as a faint rasp through plaster: “Holding. I’ve got the screw heads in hand. They’re stacked—four. I’ll tell you the second they peel away.”

Below, the female voice adds something that lands cold: “He’s in the ceiling or he’s already past us. Either way, cameras stay live. If a tile drops, I want faces on it.”

**Sensory grounding:** you’re above the utility corridor grid, directly over the electrical door line; the return vent beside you keeps sipping air, tugging at dust and loose fibers.

**Multiple threads moving:** the stack is disciplined and waiting on “Compliance,” Pritchard is ready at the service plate but pinned, and the annex team has gone quiet—meaning they’re no longer searching, they’re coordinating.

**Environmental context:** time isn’t a ticking bomb, it’s a tightening net—every extra minute increases the chance they bring a ladder, start pulling tiles in sequence, or get eyes above the grid.

**Status updates**
- Corridor stack: 4 bodies set
- Overwatch: listening under seam
- Compliance: en route / coordinating

### Turn 170 [PLAYER]

I stay perfectly still and scan for anything I can influence without moving—airflow, a loose conduit, anything that might carry a faint tap away from my position—then whisper, “Pritchard, on my mark only. If you hear them shift even one step off the electrical door, pop the plate and freeze—don’t exit, just make them think the noise is your side.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re stacked and waiting—if I move, the overwatch under me will hear it and they’ll start pulling tiles. I need to create a sound/event elsewhere to peel them off, then cue Pritchard to move while I stay hidden.*

### Turn 171 [GAME]

You hold your breath and let your eyes do the moving.

**Immediate outcome:** you find a way to throw a believable “ghost noise” down the line—*not* by tapping metal, but by exploiting the building’s airflow—and you get Pritchard set to sell it from his side without exposing himself.

Beside your ribs, the return vent’s frame has a thin, frayed strip of insulation paper caught under one screw head. It flutters with each pull of air—silent now, but if it’s freed a hair more it’ll *tick* softly against the vent lip, and the sound will travel along the duct like a phone line. You don’t touch it; you just note it, and you angle your chest a fraction to change the pressure at the seam. The flutter changes—one faint, dry *tch*—and then stops. Controlled. Repeatable.

Under you, the overwatch’s boots shift half an inch—heel to toe—like he heard the *idea* of a noise. He doesn’t look up; he leans his head toward the electrical door instead, listening for a second source.

You whisper into the gap toward the void, “Pritchard, on my mark only. If you hear them shift even one step off the electrical door, pop the plate and freeze—don’t exit, just make them think the noise is your side.”

Pritchard answers without breath: “Copy. Plate’s mine. I’ll pop and hold.”

Down the corridor, the calm female voice returns, closer now: “Compliance is two minutes out. Nobody improvises.” Another voice—male, younger—adds, “If he’s in the duct, we’ll hear him.” The overwatch gives a soft, skeptical grunt that says he’s been wronged by ceilings before.

**Sensory grounding:** you’re still belly-down above the utility corridor grid, just east of the ELECTRICAL door line; the vent beside you keeps sipping air, cold and constant.

The net tightens in a different way now: they’re waiting on a specialist, which means patience—and patience means they’ll notice patterns if you give them any.

**Status updates**
- Duct “tick” identified, controllable
- Stack holding for Compliance
- Pritchard primed at plate

### Turn 172 [PLAYER]

I stay motionless and listen for who “Compliance” is and where they’re coming from, counting seconds between radio bursts. In a whisper through the void: “Pritchard—no action unless I say. If Compliance brings a ladder, tell me immediately.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re holding tight for a specialist, so any movement now gets me caught; best play is to stay still, gather intel on “Compliance,” and prepare a timed distraction only if their formation changes.*

### Turn 173 [GAME]

You go inert again—no breath you don’t have to take—letting the corridor’s radio traffic draw a map in your head.

**Immediate outcome:** you pin down what “Compliance” means here (Marrowline’s internal splicing/forensics unit) and the direction they’re approaching from; you also learn they’re bringing the exact tool you feared.

Radio burst. Three seconds of hiss. Then the calm female voice, closer to the ELECTRICAL door: “Compliance, confirm your entry point.”

A different voice answers—flat, professional, like it’s reading off a checklist: “Compliance unit on-site. Coming from **service stairs, basement west run**. Two personnel. Cart and ladder.”

The word *ladder* makes the overwatch under your seam shift again—this time with purpose. He murmurs to the others, “Told you,” like he’s cashing in a private bet.

You count the gaps between transmissions: roughly **every 12–15 seconds** now—tight coordination, short-range. They’re close.

You whisper through the void, slow and precise: “Pritchard—no action unless I say. If Compliance brings a ladder, tell me immediately.”

Pritchard’s answer comes back with a faint scrape of cloth against plaster as he adjusts without moving his feet: “Copy. No action. And yeah—heard it on their radio. Ladder and cart. They’re coming up from basement west.”

Down below, the female voice adds, “When Compliance arrives, we sweep tiles in sequence. No hero shit.” Someone chuckles once—nervous—then kills it when she doesn’t.

**Sensory grounding:** you’re still above the utility corridor grid, directly over the ELECTRICAL door line; the fluorescents below make the seam glow pale against the dust.

**Multiple active threads:** the stack at the door is holding disciplined positions; Compliance is moving up from the basement with equipment; and Pritchard is now your early warning on their approach route—meaning the basement west run is about to get busy.

**Environmental context:** once the ladder is set, they can start lifting tiles quietly and methodically—your “stay still” advantage shrinks fast because the ceiling itself becomes the search pattern.

**Status updates**
- Compliance identified: Marrowline splice/forensics
- Approach route: basement west stairs
- Ladder/cart inbound

### Turn 174 [PLAYER]

I slowly backtrack along the conduit away from the ELECTRICAL door line, inching toward the return vent and any farther junction that leads off this corridor run. Whispering into the void: “Pritchard—stay locked on that plate; do not open it. The second you hear the ladder set down, tell me which direction their voices are—west stairs or at the door. I’m relocating for a separate drop.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to start a methodical tile sweep with a ladder, so staying put becomes suicide. I need an exit that doesn’t put me under that electrical-door stack, and I need Pritchard to stay hidden while I draw attention away or reposition. Best move is to retreat along the conduit toward a less-contested access, and coordinate timing without making him pop the plate yet.*

### Turn 175 [GAME]

You start the retreat the only way it can be done up here: millimeter by millimeter, weight distributed across joists, fingers sliding along the conduit like it’s a handrail in the dark.

**Immediate outcome:** you successfully peel away from the ELECTRICAL door line without giving the overwatch a sound to bite on—but the move costs you time, and the corridor team reacts to *something* changing in the ceiling’s “feel.”

As you inch toward the return vent, the metal gives you a cold reference point. The vent’s suction tugs at loose dust and makes your sleeve want to whisper against grit; you freeze twice to let the building swallow the noise.

Below, the overwatch shifts out from directly under your seam and drifts two paces toward the center of the hall, craning his head like he’s trying to triangulate by ear. He murmurs, low: “He’s not above the door anymore.” The calm female voice snaps back, equally low and controlled: “Hold. Don’t chase phantoms. Compliance will clear it.”

You reach a **wider junction** in the ceiling run: conduit splits around a boxed duct and there’s a **secondary return grille** with a slightly bowed frame—big enough to be a drop point if you can get it free without letting the grille clatter. Past it, the ceiling grid continues into darker territory where the fluorescents don’t reach as hard—less visibility if they start popping tiles.

You whisper into the void, “Pritchard—stay locked on that plate; do not open it. The second you hear the ladder set down, tell me which direction their voices are—west stairs or at the door. I’m relocating for a separate drop.”

Pritchard answers, tight: “Copy. Plate stays shut. I’ll call ladder contact and direction.”

Then—faint, but real—rubber wheels in the distance. Not at the door. **From the west**, a cart rolling over seams, and a short voice you haven’t heard yet: “Mind the corner—ladder first.”

**Sensory grounding:** you’re now one ceiling bay away from the main light spill, pressed beside a return duct where airflow keeps the dust in motion.

**Environmental context:** once that ladder hits the floor, they’ll start lifting tiles in sequence; every bay you put between you and the door buys you less certainty but more concealment.

**Status updates**
- Position: off electrical line
- Junction/secondary return located
- Compliance cart audible (west)

### Turn 176 [PLAYER]

I brace a palm against the bowed return grille and test it for play—feather-light—feeling for screws or a catch without shifting it enough to rattle. Whispering into the void, “Pritchard—keep your head down. Tell me the moment that ladder hits the floor and when they start pulling tiles; I’m going out through a return if it’s clean.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re bringing a ladder from the west; staying in the grid means I get methodically cleared. The secondary return grille is my best separate drop, but it can’t clatter—so I’ll prep it quietly now and time the actual exit to a distraction (ladder set-down/noise). I also need Pritchard as my ears for when they start the tile sweep.*

### Turn 177 [GAME]

Your palm settles on the bowed return grille like you’re calming an animal. You test for play—feather-light—just enough to read how it’s held.

**Immediate outcome:** it’s not screwed in. It’s held by two spring clips on the long edges—common maintenance hardware. The bow isn’t damage; it’s been *pried before* and never seated perfectly again. When you press in the center, the frame gives a millimeter and rebounds. When you press near the right edge, you feel one clip bite, then flex—quiet, controllable. Clean exit *possible*… if you can keep the frame from snapping back and “tinging” against the duct.

A faint smear of gray-black on the inside lip catches your fingertip: old glove soot and duct dust—someone’s used this as a route.

**Sensory grounding:** you’re one bay deeper into the dim run, chest against dusty tile rails, the return duct breathing cold air up your sleeves.

From the west, the cart wheels stop. Rubber squeaks. Then a heavier sound: metal-on-concrete, careful but unavoidable.

Pritchard whispers through the void, voice tight: “Ladder just hit. West stairs side. They’re staging it… hold—”

Below you, the calm female voice is closer to the west now, addressing the new arrivals: “Compliance, you’re late. Start at the door and work back. Keep it quiet.”

A male Compliance tech answers, bored confidence: “Copy. Tile pull sequence. No breaks in pattern.”

You hear the first ceiling tile shift—paper grit sliding on grid—then a soft *thunk* as it’s lifted and rested against the ladder.

Pritchard again, lower: “They’re pulling. Starting near the ELECTRICAL door like she said.”

**Environmental context:** once they’re in a sequence, they’ll close distance bay-by-bay; the longer you wait, the more likely they’ll reach your junction while you’re halfway committed to the grille—worst timing for noise.

**Status updates**
- Return grille: spring clips, used before  
- Ladder set down: west stairs  
- Tile pull begun: at electrical door

### Turn 178 [PLAYER]

I hook two fingers under the grille’s inner lip and ease one spring clip free a hair at a time, keeping steady pressure so it can’t snap back and ring. I pause and peer/listen through the gap for footsteps or voices directly below the return before I widen it enough to slip through. Whispering into the void: “Pritchard—keep feeding me their progress bay by bay; if they get within two tiles of my junction, say it.”

*Agent reasoning: They’ve started a systematic tile pull; waiting increases risk of being caught mid-move. The return grille is a viable exit with spring clips, so I should commit now, but do it slowly to avoid the metal “ting” and to confirm what’s on the other side before dropping.*

### Turn 179 [GAME]

You get two fingers under the inner lip and start “walking” the right-side spring clip out—one controlled breath at a time, constant counter-pressure so it can’t slap back.

**Immediate outcome:** the clip yields. Not all at once—just enough that the right edge of the grille opens a dark, finger-wide gap. No ring. No snap. Only a dry, almost inaudible *tick* as metal clears metal, swallowed by the return’s steady inhale.

You freeze with the gap held open and angle your eye to it.

**Sensory grounding:** cold air pulls at your eyelashes; the duct breath smells like detergent and old heat—laundry exhaust mixed with boiler dust.

Through the slit you can see down into the utility corridor: pale fluorescent spill, the top of the ELECTRICAL door area far off to your right… and directly beneath this return, **empty floor**—no boots planted under you. The soundscape matches: voices are west and right, not under this spot.

A radio chirps below, closer now, and you catch the Compliance tech calling out like he’s reading a grid: “Tile one… clear. Tile two… clear.” Paper grit slides again—another tile lifted—then the soft *tap* of it leaning against the ladder.

Pritchard whispers, strained but steady: “They’re moving. Two tiles pulled off the door line. She’s watching their hands—real careful.”

The calm female voice adds, impatient: “Don’t leave gaps. Put them back as you go. I don’t want a mess upstairs.”

That tells you something ugly: they’re not just searching—you’re being **contained**. They’ll reset behind themselves to hide the sweep from anyone else who walks in later.

The return grille in your hand flexes another millimeter; the left clip is still engaged, holding the frame from dropping. Your gap is big enough to listen and look, not yet big enough to slip a shoulder through without committing.

**Environmental context:** once their sequence reaches your bay, they’ll be close enough to hear even a controlled grille scrape—and if they’re resetting tiles behind them, you won’t get a second “quiet window” after they pass.

**Status updates**
- Right spring clip: partially freed
- Floor below return: currently clear
- Compliance sweep: 2 tiles in, resetting behind

### Turn 180 [PLAYER]

I ease the left spring clip free with steady pressure, then lower the grille into the duct without letting it touch metal; I slip through feet-first, controlling my descent and aiming to land silent beneath the return. In a whisper: “Pritchard—count their tiles out loud for me, just numbers. If anyone breaks off toward this return, say ‘split.’”

*Agent reasoning: They’re sweeping toward me and resetting behind—my window is now. The floor under the return is clear, so I should commit to the drop quietly before they get within earshot. I need Pritchard’s bay count to time it, but I can’t wait too long.*

### Turn 181 [GAME]

The left spring clip fights you for half a second—then gives with a soft, padded *shff* as you keep tension on it. You cradle the grille into the duct throat instead of letting it drop. No metal kiss, no ringing protest.

**Immediate outcome:** you get out clean. Feet-first, you slide down the return’s short throat, elbows tucked, boots finding the wall for friction. You drop the last foot and land under the return on the balls of your feet, knees bent, letting your coat settle instead of swish. Silent enough that the corridor’s own hum swallows you.

**Sensory grounding:** you’re now in the utility corridor beneath the return, fluorescent light bleaching the concrete; the air down here is warmer and smells faintly of bleach and wet lint.

Overhead, the grille is still in your hands for a beat—half inside the duct. You ease it up into the throat so it can’t be seen from below at a glance, leaving it resting on internal ledges rather than hanging.

Down the hall to your right, toward the ELECTRICAL door area, a ladder squeaks as weight shifts and a tile scrapes free. The Compliance tech’s voice is clearer now: “Three… four…” like he’s calling bingo numbers to himself.

Pritchard, whispering through the void (muffled now, but audible), starts feeding you exactly what you asked for: “One… two… three…” He pauses, listening. “Four.”

A second male voice—heavier, bored—mutters near the ladder: “If he dropped, he’s already gone.” The calm woman answers without heat: “Then we find where. Keep counting.”

**Multiple active threads:** the sweep is closing in tile-by-tile from the door line; the corridor itself offers cover in the form of a recessed service alcove with a mop sink and stacked chemical jugs ten feet west of you; and above, your exit point is now a liability if anyone looks up and notices the grille not seated flush.

**Environmental context:** they’re resetting tiles behind them, meaning once they pass a bay it “looks normal” again—good for them, bad for you. The longer you stay under open ceiling, the more likely someone glances up for the *one* thing out of place.

**Status updates**
- Position: utility corridor, under return  
- Ceiling sweep: 4 tiles in

### Turn 182 [PLAYER]

I slide west into the recessed service alcove by the mop sink, keeping my shoulders tight to the wall, and crouch behind the stacked chemical jugs. In a whisper: “Pritchard—keep counting. If you hit six, tell me how many bays from the return you think that is.”

*Agent reasoning: My exit point above is a tell if anyone looks up, and the sweep is advancing. I need to get out of the open and into cover fast, then decide whether to blend, hide, or slip another route while Pritchard keeps counting.*

### Turn 183 [GAME]

You ghost west along the wall, shoulders tight, letting the corridor light fall away as you slip into the recessed service alcove. The stacked chemical jugs block you from casual sightlines; you crouch low behind them, breathing through your nose to keep your chest quiet.

**Immediate outcome:** you make it into cover without drawing attention. No shouted “hey,” no sudden flashlight beam—just the corridor’s hum and the distant scrape of ceiling tile.

**Sensory grounding:** the alcove stinks of bleach and sour mop water; the mop sink’s metal lip is cold under your knuckles, and the jugs are tacky with dried drips.

Down the hall to the east, voices stay in motion—boots shifting on ladder rungs, tile edges rasping. The Compliance tech continues his counting, closer now: “Five…” Then, a pause like he’s listening to the building itself. “Six.”

Pritchard whispers back through the void, keeping it simple like you asked: “Five… six.” A beat. “Six is… I think two bays from your return. Maybe three. Hard to judge through the duct—sound’s bouncing.”

The calm woman snaps a correction at someone on the ladder: “Stop. Hold that tile. Check the return spacing—don’t assume the grid is standard in this wing.”

That’s the tell: she’s not searching blind; she’s mapping the ceiling features—returns, seams, anything that would hide a drop.

A heavier male voice mutters, closer to your side of the hall than before: “You want me under it?” The woman: “Not yet.”

**Environmental context:** they’re close enough now that a careless breath or jug scrape could carry, and their method—counting and verifying return spacing—means your unseated grille is a problem they’re actively triangulating, not something they’ll miss by luck.

### Turn 184 [PLAYER]

I stay crouched and slowly scan the corridor for a second exit from the alcove—any door, latch, or utility access—without shifting the jugs. Whispering, “Pritchard—do you still have eyes on that plate? Any chance you can make a small, safe noise at the ELECTRICAL door side to keep them anchored there—something that doesn’t expose you?”

*Agent reasoning: They’re close and actively triangulating the return; staying put risks them spotting the unseated grille and checking the floor beneath it. I need a quieter, less “obvious” hiding spot and to buy time by keeping them focused away from this alcove, without making noise.*

### Turn 185 [GAME]

You keep your weight planted and let only your head and eyes move, scanning from behind the chemical jugs.

**Immediate outcome:** the alcove has a second way out—but it’s not a clean “door.” Just inside the recess, low on the back wall behind the mop sink’s trap, you spot a **rectangular utility access panel** (painted over, two slotted screws) with a faint draft feathering the grime at its edges. Not big enough for a full-body exit as-is, but it looks like it opens into a shallow chase or conduit bay.

To the east, the ceiling-tile crew pauses again; you hear the ladder creak as someone shifts down a rung. A flashlight beam slides along the corridor ceiling line and briefly kisses the return area you dropped from—then moves off.

**Sensory grounding:** bleach sting in your nose, cold porcelain/enameled sink edge under your wrist; the corridor’s fluorescent buzz is loud enough to hide a whisper, not loud enough to hide metal-on-metal.

Pritchard answers, voice thin and careful: “I’ve got eyes on the plate, yeah—through a seam. They’re clustered near ELECTRICAL. If I make noise, it’ll travel in the void. But I can do *small*.”

A heartbeat later, you hear it: not a bang—more like a **light, controlled tap** from that direction, as if a loose conduit or a junction cover got nudged and settled. It’s plausible building noise, but placed.

The calm woman reacts immediately: “Hold. That was from the electrical run.” Heavy voice: “Finally.” The tech: “You want me to drop and check the door?” She: “No. Keep the grid. But we don’t leave this side until we know what made that sound.”

They stay anchored—good—but their attention sharpens. You catch another detail in their cadence: they’re not just hunting a person; they’re hunting **evidence of a breach**. The woman’s the one who cares about what gets left behind.

**Environmental context:** your access panel is quiet *if* you can work the screws without scraping; but the longer they linger near ELECTRICAL, the higher the chance one of them decides to “clear the corridor” at floor level while the others keep pulling tiles.

### Turn 186 [PLAYER]

I stay low and ease my hand to the utility access panel, testing the paint-caked screws with my fingertips for looseness without turning them yet. Whispering, “Pritchard—stay still. Are any of them stepping off the ladder onto the floor to clear the corridor, or are they all still up on the grid?”

*Agent reasoning: They’re anchored for the moment, but a floor-level sweep could expose me fast. The access panel might buy concealment even if it’s tight, so I’ll prep it as quietly as possible and confirm with Pritchard before committing.*

### Turn 187 [GAME]

Your fingertips find the two slotted screws by feel—paint-caked, but not fused. The top one has the faintest give, like it’s been worried before; the bottom one feels tighter, crusted with old latex and grit. You don’t turn either—just confirm you *can*.

The mop sink blocks most of your hand movement from the corridor, but the panel’s edge sits close enough to the jug stack that a slip would click plastic against metal. You keep your wrist locked, slow.

Bleach stings your eyes; the alcove’s fluorescent spill turns the dried drips on the jugs into dull white scars.

Pritchard whispers back, controlled and flat: “Two on the ladder. One’s off—boots on the floor. He’s moving, slow. He’s not sweeping hard, he’s… listening and looking up.” A pause. “He’s about halfway between ELECTRICAL and your return line.”

Down the corridor, you hear it confirm: rubber soles on concrete, a stop-start cadence. The heavy voice rumbles, closer than before, like he’s talking to the ceiling more than his team: “If you’re in the duct, you breathe loud down here.”

The calm woman answers from the ladder area, clipped: “Don’t freelance. Keep your eyes up. If he dropped, he left a seam.”

A flashlight beam skates along the corridor wall and briefly washes the alcove’s outer edge—but the jugs and recess keep you in shadow. The beam lingers a fraction longer than comfort, then slides away as the man on the floor tilts it up, checking the ceiling grid.

**Status updates**

### Turn 188 [PLAYER]

I freeze behind the jugs, hand resting on the panel without moving it, and track the approaching footsteps by sound. Whispering: “Pritchard—tell me when his boots cross the return line. If his light comes into the alcove again, say ‘beam.’”

*Agent reasoning: One guy is approaching and scanning; turning screws risks noise. I need to stay hidden and gather timing, only committing to the panel if he passes or looks away.*

### Turn 189 [GAME]

You go statue-still behind the jugs, palm flattened on the panel like you’re just another layer of paint. The only movement is your attention—counting footfalls, measuring distance by the way sound changes in the corridor.

**Immediate outcome:** the floor searcher doesn’t clock you. He slows near your position, close enough that you can hear his jacket creak when he shifts his shoulders, but he keeps his light angled up at the grid—still hunting seams and returns, not alcove recesses.

**Sensory grounding:** you’re crouched in the alcove’s shadow, mop-sour air and bleach in your throat; a thin draft tickles the grime line around the access panel under your hand.

Pritchard’s whisper is almost silent, like it’s coming through a crack in the building: “Copy.”

The boots advance… stop… advance. Then a faint scuff right where you’d dropped down earlier—your “return line” landmark.

Pritchard breathes, “He’s at it. Crossing now.”

A flashlight beam sweeps the ceiling, then dips lower in a lazy arc—too low. Pritchard snaps, tight: “**Beam.**”

Light licks the alcove’s outer lip and catches the nearest jug’s label, making the plastic gleam. It doesn’t go deep enough to silhouette you, but it’s a near miss; the man on the floor is close enough that you can hear him inhale through his nose, testing the air.

Down by ELECTRICAL, the calm woman’s voice cuts in, impatient: “You see anything?” The heavy voice (floor) answers, “Nothing yet. But the air moves weird down here.” The tech on the ladder adds, “Grid’s clean on this run. No broken clips.”

That last line matters: they’re realizing someone moved through without leaving obvious ceiling damage—meaning they’ll start thinking **walls, panels, and service bays** next.

**Environmental context:** the longer the floor man lingers, the more likely he gets bored of looking up and starts checking recesses at hand level—alcoves like yours are the first thing a tired pro clears when the ceiling comes up empty.

**Status updates**
- Floor searcher: at return line  
- Flashlight: grazed alcove edge

### Turn 190 [PLAYER]

When his beam slides off the alcove again, I slowly turn the top screw with my fingertips, then the bottom—no tools—using the mop sink to shield the movement; I ease the panel open a hair and slip my fingers into the gap to pull it toward me without a click. Whispering, “Pritchard—tell me the second his boots turn back toward ELECTRICAL.”

*Agent reasoning: He’s close and starting to key in on airflow; if he checks alcoves next I’m cooked. Best move is to quietly get into the utility chase now, but only if I can do it without a scrape—use the sink to mask motion and wait for his light to angle away.*

### Turn 191 [GAME]

The beam slides away down the corridor, and you move like you’re trying not to wake a sleeping dog.

**Immediate outcome:** the top screw turns under your fingertips—slow, gritty, paint cracking in tiny, silent flakes. The bottom screw fights you; you coax it a quarter-turn at a time until it finally gives with a soft *tack* of paint breaking. Not loud, but in this corridor every small sound feels like it carries. You keep the mop sink between you and the hallway and ease the panel outward a hair.

You slip two fingers into the gap and pull—steady pressure, no snap. The panel comes free without a click.

Behind it: a shallow **utility chase**—dark, dust-heavy, with bundled cabling and a narrow void that runs laterally. Not comfortable, but it’s *space*.

**Sensory grounding:** your knuckles scrape cold metal edge; dust puffs into your nose from the chase, tasting like old drywall and insulation.

Out in the corridor, the floor man pauses again. His boots stop close—still near the return line. You hear his flashlight angle change by the faint tick of its housing. Down by ELECTRICAL, the calm woman’s voice tightens: “Air movement doesn’t happen by itself. Check for loose plates.”

Pritchard whispers, urgent: “He’s still facing your way—listening.” A beat. “He’s… turning.” Another beat as his mic catches a breath. “Now—boots rotating back toward ELECTRICAL.”

The heavy voice (floor) mutters, a little annoyed: “Probably a draft off the annex. I’m coming back.” His steps start retreating—slow at first, then more confident as he gets pulled back into the group’s gravity.

The ladder team shifts; metal creaks as someone repositions. The tech says, “I can pull vent grilles next.” The woman answers, “Not yet. Seal the corridor doors first. Nobody leaves this level.”

**Environmental context:** you’ve bought seconds, not safety. If they start “loose plates,” this exact kind of panel becomes their next instinct—especially if they decide to lock down exits and search methodically.

### Turn 192 [PLAYER]

I slip into the utility chase sideways, pulling my shoulders through slow, and draw the panel back into place loosely—held by my fingertips so it won’t click—leaving just a hairline gap for air. Whispering, “Pritchard—listen for any door latches or locks engaging; tell me which side they start sealing from, and if anyone breaks off toward the service alcoves.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re talking about sealing doors and checking loose plates next, which puts this alcove at risk. The utility chase is tight but buys concealment and a new route; I should get inside now, keep the panel ready to reseat, and have Pritchard listen for door movement and direction changes.*

### Turn 193 [GAME]

You feed yourself into the utility chase sideways—shoulder, ribs, hip—moving on exhales so the metal doesn’t sing. It’s tighter than it looked; your coat drags against bundled cable and gritty insulation. But you’re in.

You draw the panel back into place with two fingertips, keeping it floating on a cushion of air. It settles with a soft *thum* against paint—no click, no rattle—leaving a hairline seam you can breathe through and watch as a thin slice of corridor light.

Inside the chase it’s pitch-dark and close, the kind of cramped that makes you aware of your heartbeat in your teeth. A warm conduit hums against your forearm; dust and old adhesive stink like a dead office.

Out in the corridor, voices drift, muffled by metal and drywall. The calm woman is closer now, giving orders like she owns the building: “Start sealing from ELECTRICAL. Riser door first. Then the stair.”

A heavier voice answers, “Copy. Riser’s mine.”

Then—distinct in the narrow seam of sound—**a steel door latch**: the thick, mechanical *CHUNK* of a deadbolt or bar being thrown. It’s not a normal office lock; it’s service hardware.

Pritchard whispers in your ear, low and fast: “Heard it—ELECTRICAL side. They’re sealing from your east. One broke off—boots moving mid-corridor, toward the service alcoves. Not running, clearing.”

As if on cue, footsteps approach your alcove area again—different cadence than the floor searcher earlier. Slower, deliberate. A flashlight beam skates along the corridor at knee height this time, and you catch it through the seam as a pale stripe that stops… backs up… stops again right near your panel.

The man outside murmurs to himself, almost bored: “Loose plates… loose plates…”

Somewhere farther down, another latch hits—lighter, like a stairwell crash bar being zip-tied or chained. The tech’s voice carries: “Stair’s secured. Corridor’s a box.”

**Environmental pressure:** once they finish sealing, their search pattern tightens—alcoves and panels become the next logical sweep, and you’re now in a metal throat with limited room to turn around.

### Turn 194 [PLAYER]

I inch deeper down the utility chase away from the panel, moving only when the hallway footsteps shift, feeling for any junction box, grate, or widening in the run. Whispering into the mic, “Pritchard—do you know if this chase ties to the riser or stairwell? I need a direction, now.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to check this exact panel; staying still risks them spotting the seam. I need to get away from this access point quietly and find where the chase leads before the corridor is fully sealed.*

### Turn 195 [GAME]

You inch away from the panel in millimeters, timing each slide with the hallway man’s weight-shifts. It works—mostly. The chase swallows sound, but not perfectly; your coat rasp against a cable bundle makes a faint, papery *shhh* that you feel more than hear.

A few feet in, your fingertips find a **widening**—a framed pocket where conduit splits. There’s a **metal junction box** here, warm to the touch, and above it a **return-vent backdraft grille** you can press on from behind. The grille has give, but it’s painted into place; pushing it hard will pop it with a noise.

Through the hairline seam you left behind, the corridor searcher’s flashlight stops again. You can’t see his face, but you hear the change in his breathing—attention narrowing. He drags something lightly along the wall—maybe a gloved knuckle, maybe a pen—listening for hollow.

Pritchard answers you in a tight whisper, the kind that means he’s crouched behind a radio and praying nobody keys up over him: “I don’t have the building map—Marrowline keeps those off our terminals. But I hear their callouts. ‘Riser’ is ELECTRICAL side—east. Stair’s the same direction. If you go deeper in the chase and it bends, you’re likely tracking **toward the riser spine**. If it drops, you’re near a vertical run.”

As he speaks, another sound cuts in—**zip-ties cinching** or a chain being pulled tight, then a sharp *clack* of a latch. The corridor really is becoming a sealed tube.

Outside your panel, the searcher murmurs, closer now: “Paint’s fresh…” Then, louder, to the woman: “I got a plate that’s been handled.”

The calm woman doesn’t raise her voice, but it carries: “Hold it. Don’t rip it. I want eyes on it and a camera before we touch.”

**Environmental pressure:** they’ve just shifted from “searching” to “documenting.” That means they suspect intrusion—and they’re about to put a lens on your hiding place.

### Turn 196 [PLAYER]

I slide deeper past the warm junction box, feeling ahead for any vertical drop or seam that suggests a riser tie-in, moving only when their voices overlap. Under my breath: “Pritchard—if they bring a camera up on that panel, tell me; I may have to force a vent.”

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to document the panel, so staying near it is a dead end. The vent grille is risky but might be my only lateral exit; better to scout for a vertical drop toward the riser first and only pop the grille if I’m trapped.*

### Turn 197 [GAME]

You slide past the warm junction box, using the overlap of voices as cover. The chase narrows again, then—your left hand finds a **seam**: a vertical join where the wall framing changes and the air gets cooler. You probe down with your fingers and hit **ladder rungs** set into the metal: a **vertical riser run**. It drops away beneath you and rises above, like a throat.

You shift your weight to test it and the metal gives a tiny *ting*—not loud, but pure. Outside, the corridor noise hiccups: someone pauses mid-sentence, listening.

**Sensory grounding:** you’re now a few body-lengths east of the alcove panel, pressed against cold metal with the riser opening at your shoulder; the conduit hum is louder here, a steady vibration you feel in your ribs.

In the corridor, the calm woman is all business: “Get me the scope.” The tech answers, closer, “I’ve got the snake-cam—thirty seconds.” A different voice—young, eager—adds, “Want me to tag it for splice?” That word hangs there like a threat.

Pritchard comes back in a whisper that’s almost a hiss: “Copy. I’ll call it when the camera’s up. I’m hearing them stack near your alcove—two bodies. They’re treating it like evidence now.”

Somewhere nearby—outside the wall—you catch a faint electronic chirp, then the soft plastic rasp of a case being opened. The searcher who noticed the paint says, quieter now, “Plate’s warm. Somebody was in here.”

A new sound leaks through the chase from outside the building: a delivery van idling too smoothly for this hour, and a thin, rhythmic *tap…tap…tap* like someone clicking a pen against a clipboard.

**Environmental context:** once that snake-cam goes in, they don’t need to open the panel to confirm you’re inside; if you force the return grille from behind, it’ll be loud but it might put you into the utility corridor ceiling space you mapped earlier.

### Turn 198 [PLAYER]

I grip the ladder rungs and ease myself up the riser a few feet—slow, controlling any metal-on-metal noise—then stop and listen hard for airflow or voices above vs below. Whispering, “Pritchard—camera’s about to go in; if you hear ‘scope live’ or see them insert it, say ‘eyes.’ Also, any clue if the roof access is sealed?”

*Agent reasoning: They’re about to confirm my presence with a snake-cam; staying near the panel is a losing bet. A riser gives me vertical options and distance from the entry point, and I can pause to listen for which direction has less activity before committing.*

### Turn 199 [GAME]

You take the rungs in a white-knuckle grip and start up—one rung at a time, heel-to-toe, letting your weight settle before you move again. It’s slow enough that the riser doesn’t ring. The only sound you can’t kill is your own breath scraping the back of your throat.

A few feet up, you stop and listen.

**Above:** cooler air, a faint draft that smells like tar and wet gravel—roof-adjacent, or at least near an exterior vent run. No voices, but you catch a distant *thrum* that could be rooftop HVAC.  
**Below:** warmer, electrical hum, and the muffled corridor voices bleeding through the wall—closer than you’d like.

You’re now in the vertical riser, east of the alcove panel, with the ladder rungs cold under your palms and a thin vibration traveling up the metal like a pulse.

Down below, the calm woman says, “Scope online in ten.” The tech replies, “Battery green—feeding to tablet.” The searcher who clocked the paint adds, “I’ll keep the plate steady. Don’t want to smear.”

Pritchard comes back, voice tight: “Got you. I’ll say ‘eyes’ the second I hear insertion.” A beat. “Roof—unclear. I heard ‘stair secured’ earlier, and ‘riser door first.’ No one’s called roof secure on our channel. But Marrowline runs their own comms—I can’t see their internal.”

As if to underline it, a new voice cracks faintly over someone’s headset below—tinny, corporate: “—confirm rooftop observer still has line-of-sight. Do not lose the subject.”

That tells you two things at once: they’ve got someone up top already, and they’re treating you as a moving target, not a rat in a wall.

Then you hear it—plastic on paint, a soft *scritch*—the snake-cam being positioned at the panel seam.

Pritchard snaps a whisper: “**Eyes.** They’re inserting.”

### Turn 200 [PLAYER]

I freeze for two breaths, then continue climbing up the riser slowly, pausing every few rungs to feel for a hatch seam, duct tie-in, or grille I can open quietly. Whispering, “Pritchard—tell me the second they call out anything they *see* on that scope, and if rooftop starts moving to intercept.”

*Agent reasoning: The snake-cam is going to spot me if I stay near the horizontal run, and they may have roof eyes, so I should keep moving upward quietly to a better exit point while listening for a hatch or vent I can use without making a loud break.*

### Turn 201 [GAME]

You hold still—two careful breaths—letting the riser’s vibration settle. Then you climb again, slow enough that your boots don’t chatter on the rungs. Every few steps you pat the walls for a change in texture.

A seam shows itself: **a narrow, gasketed hatch** set into the riser wall at chest height, its edge just proud of the metal. You test it with two fingers. It’s latched, but not bolted—more like a maintenance access. The latch has a little play; opening it *might* be quiet if you control the swing.

**Sensory grounding:** you’re now higher in the vertical run, the air cooler and wetter; the metal smells like rain-cooled iron. Somewhere above, HVAC thrums like a distant engine.

Below, voices sharpen—the snake-cam has found something.

The tech says, “I’ve got… conduit, dust… wait—scratch marks. Recent.”  
The calm woman: “Keep it centered. Follow the run.”  
Then, a beat later, the searcher: “There’s a vertical. He went up.”

Pritchard whispers fast in your ear, keeping his words clipped: “They see disturbance—scratch marks—and they’ve clocked you went **up**. Rooftop… hold—” You hear him keying his mic, then he comes back: “Rooftop observer just said, ‘I’m repositioning to the east lip.’ That’s movement to intercept, Vane.”

Down in the corridor, the calm woman’s tone changes—no longer investigative, now tactical: “Cut the building stair. I want the roof hatch watched. If he pops out, I want him looking into lights.”

A heavier voice answers, “Copy. Moving.”

The hatch beside you suddenly matters more: it’s likely your only quiet exit from this metal throat before they seal the top and bottom.

**Environmental pressure:** they’re transitioning from scope-confirmation to containment; once they get eyes on the riser endpoints, your vertical space becomes a trap.

**Status updates**
- Hatch seam located (gasketed)

### Turn 202 [PLAYER]

I brace my boot on a rung, cup the latch with my palm to muffle it, and ease the gasketed hatch open a finger-width—stopping to listen—then widen it just enough to peek through without spilling light. Whispering, “Pritchard—talk to me: where’s rooftop now, and do you hear anyone moving toward this riser level?”

*Agent reasoning: They’ve confirmed I’m in the vertical and are moving to seal endpoints, so lingering means getting boxed in. The gasketed hatch is my best quiet lateral exit; I’ll open it slowly and recon before committing, while keeping Pritchard feeding me rooftop movement.*

### Turn 203 [GAME]

You cup the latch and ease pressure into it like you’re defusing a spring. The metal gives—*barely*—a soft, dampened click swallowed by your palm. The gasket resists, then peels with a faint, sticky sigh. You stop at a finger-width.

Nothing shouts back. No flashlight beam. No sudden voices right on the other side—just a wash of colder air that smells like rain and roofing tar.

You widen it another inch and put one eye to the crack without letting your phone screen or any reflected light betray you.

**Immediate outcome:** you’ve opened into a shallow service cavity that leads to a **roof-side utility penthouse corridor**—unfinished plywood, insulated ducting, and a run of conduit disappearing left (west) toward the main roof hatch housing. A thin strip of sodium light leaks under a door further down, and you can see the shadow of someone’s boots passing once—slow, deliberate—like they’re pacing a post.

**Sensory grounding:** you’re still on the riser ladder, hatch at your right shoulder; cold air needles your knuckles through the crack.

Down below, through the riser metal, you hear the scope team get confident: “Vertical confirmed. He’s near a maintenance hatch—” The tech’s voice cuts as if someone shushed him.

Pritchard answers your whisper, breathy and strained: “Rooftop’s east lip—observer repositioned. I’m hearing footfalls above you now, not running—controlled. They’re trying to bracket the exits.” A pause, then lower: “And Vane… Marrowline’s channel just said ‘**hold the penthouse door**.’ That sounds like the level you’re peeking into.”

As if on cue, from the space beyond your crack: a radio murmurs, close enough to make out words through the door seam—“…don’t open the roof hatch until Compliance says. He’s in the riser.”

Time pressure tightens: below has a camera in the pipe, above has a post on a door, and you’re the hinge between them.

**Status updates**
- Hatch opened: quiet, controlled  
- Above: penthouse level occupied  
- Below: scope nearing your hatch

### Turn 204 [PLAYER]

I ease the hatch shut to a hairline gap again and climb two rungs up, feeling above for any second seam or vent tie-in. Whispering, “Pritchard—how close is that scope to my hatch, and can you hear if the penthouse door post moves off position?” Then I gently flick a tiny pebble or bit of grit through the crack toward the west conduit run, trying to make a soft, misleading tick away from the door.

*Agent reasoning: Going out into the penthouse corridor risks walking straight into a posted guard, while staying means the scope from below will spot the open hatch and pinpoint me. I need more intel before committing—specifically how close the scope is and whether there’s another exit above/below. I’ll also try a minimal, quiet diversion to pull the door post away without exposing myself.*

### Turn 205 [GAME]

You draw the hatch back to a hairline—just enough to breathe through—and climb two rungs. The riser metal flexes under your weight with a tiny, complaining *ting* that you can’t quite smother.

You sweep your fingertips over the wall above your head. **Immediate outcome:** you find another interruption in the sheet metal—**a round, louvered tie-in grille**, about palm-sized, screwed into a collar that feels like it feeds into a duct run. The louvers are dusty and slightly oily; if you can get it off, it’s a sideways exit into the penthouse ductwork instead of through the main hatch.

Through the hairline crack you kept, you flick a bit of grit toward the west conduit run. It lands with a soft *tick…tick* against metal.

For half a second nothing.

Then the boots you saw earlier stop pacing. A radio squawks low. The door-post’s shadow shifts—weight shifting, not leaving. A cautious voice, close and muffled, says: “Heard that. West side.” Another voice answers from deeper in the penthouse corridor: “Hold. Don’t chase sound. Compliance wants eyes on hatch.”

So the decoy works—**it pulls their attention**, but their orders keep them anchored.

Pritchard comes in tight, whispering through his own tension: “Scope’s close. I just heard ‘maintenance hatch’ and ‘louvers’ on their end—so they’re within a few feet of your level. Penthouse post didn’t abandon; he shifted and checked west with his head, but he’s still on the door.”

Below you, the snake-cam team’s tone turns eager, like they can taste you: “He’s right here—angle up—there—” followed by a sharp, controlled: “Cut lights in the riser if you can. Don’t give him silhouettes.”

**Sensory grounding:** you’re mid-ladder in the vertical riser, hatch crack to your right shoulder, new louvered grille just above your forehead; cold air beads on the metal like sweat.

**Status updates**
- Second exit found: louvered grille
- Decoy sound: attention shifted, post held
- Scope: within feet, tightening

### Turn 206 [PLAYER]

I kill my breathing and set both hands on the louvered grille, turning each screw a quarter-turn at a time with my fingertips and the edge of my key, catching the screws in my palm so they don’t drop. Whispering, “Pritchard—if they say ‘visual’ or start opening the hatch, tell me immediately.” Then I ease the grille free and slip my fingers into the duct collar to feel for clearance before committing my shoulder through.

*Agent reasoning: The scope is about to spot me at the hatch level, and the penthouse door is covered. The palm-sized louvered tie-in is my best low-profile exit—quieter than forcing the main hatch and less predictable than staying put. I need to move before they kill lights or pin me from both ends.*

### Turn 207 [GAME]

You freeze your breath at the top of your lungs until your chest feels like glass. Fingers on the louvered grille, you work each screw a quarter-turn at a time—key edge biting just enough to move metal without a scrape. You catch each screw in your palm before it can ping down the riser.

**Immediate outcome:** the grille comes free cleanly. No drop, no clang. When you slip your fingers into the duct collar, you find **clearance**—a rectangular duct run just beyond the collar, big enough to take a shoulder if you angle in. The inside is lined with gritty insulation and a film of oily dust; it’s cold, and it smells like old rain and machine breath.

To your right, through the hairline gap of the gasketed hatch, the penthouse corridor’s sodium spill still leaks under that door. The door-post’s shadow hasn’t left, but it’s shifted closer to the seam as if listening harder now that the riser has gone quiet.

Below, the snake-cam team is right on top of your level. You hear the tech whisper, excited and tight: “I’m at the hatch—” then a sharper voice cuts in: “Hands off until we confirm. He’s not dumb.”

Pritchard comes back in your ear, barely audible: “Copy. I’m listening. If they say ‘visual,’ you won’t hear my whisper—you’ll hear me yell.” A beat, then: “They’re stacking below. I caught ‘two up, one holds corridor.’ And Vane—Marrowline’s Compliance line just said: ‘If he vanishes, lock the feeds and log the time.’ That’s… not a normal arrest.”

In the penthouse space, a radio murmur bleeds through the door seam: “—don’t touch the roof hatch. Wait for the woman.” The calm Compliance woman, somewhere, is keeping the leash tight.

**Sensory grounding:** you’re still on the riser ladder, grille removed above your forehead; your knuckles are inside the duct collar, feeling the sharp lip of sheet metal and the soft grit of insulation.

**Status updates**
- Louvered grille removed (silent)

### Turn 208 [PLAYER]

I pocket the screws, then slide my shoulder into the duct collar and worm in feet-first, keeping my boots from kicking the metal. Whispering, “Pritchard—if I say ‘vent,’ I’m off comms; don’t call my name again unless it’s life-or-death.” I pause once inside to listen for any movement in the duct run before I crawl.

*Agent reasoning: The scope team is seconds from opening the hatch; the penthouse door is covered, so the duct is my safest exit. I need to move quietly and also give Pritchard a simple cue if I’m forced to go dark.*

### Turn 209 [GAME]

You pocket the screws and ease your shoulder through the collar, turning your body into a careful wedge. Boots first, toes pointed, you use your forearms to *pull* instead of letting your heels kick. The duct takes you—tight, but it takes you.

**Immediate outcome:** you’re fully inside the duct run, feet-first, with the riser collar behind your ribs. No loud bang—just a faint *shff* of fabric against dusty metal. The duct flexes once under your weight like a cheap drumhead, then settles.

You whisper the boundary to Pritchard—“vent”—and he answers with a clipped exhale that means he heard and he’ll honor it: “Understood. I’m dark unless you’re dying.”

You stop and listen.

**Sensory grounding:** the air in here is cold and stale, tasting of fiberglass and old grease; each breath sounds too big in the narrow tin throat. Somewhere ahead, to the west, the duct makes a shallow bend—your fingertips can feel the seam lines change direction.

Below and behind you, the riser world keeps moving without you: muffled through sheet metal, a voice says, close and sharp, “Hatch is intact. He’s not here.” Another: “Check the louvers—now.” A gloved hand scrapes at the collar area you just abandoned—too late, but close enough that the vibration trembles through the duct and into your teeth.

From the penthouse corridor side, a radio bleeds through the metal in a different tone—calm, managerial: “Do not enter the ductwork. Seal the riser tie-in. We need him alive and *unseen*.” That last word lands wrong, like it’s written into procedure.

In the duct ahead of you, you catch it: **a second presence**—not footsteps, but the soft, periodic *tink…tink* of something tapping metal, like a loose hanger wire or a cable tie flicking with airflow. It’s faint and intermittent, coming from farther west past the bend.

Time pressure tightens: they’ve discovered the missing grille, and their next move is to either flood the duct with light/sound—or seal and smoke you out.

**Status updates**
- Position: inside duct run  
- Riser team: checking louvers  
- Penthouse orders: “seal tie-in”
